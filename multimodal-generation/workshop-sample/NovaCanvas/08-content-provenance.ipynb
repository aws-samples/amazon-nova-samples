    "## Introduction to Content Provenance\n",
    "\n",
    "Content Credentials (C2PA) is a built-in feature of Amazon Nova Canvas that enables verification and tracking of AI-generated images. This capability adds cryptographically verifiable metadata to every generated image, documenting its origin, creation process, and any subsequent modifications. The metadata includes details such as generation timestamp, model information, and AWS's digital signature, enabling both automated and manual verification of authenticity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Case\n",
    "\n",
    "OctankFashion wants to ensure transparency with their customers about their use of AI in their marketing materials. They need a reliable way to:\n",
    "1. Prove the authenticity of their AI-generated product images\n",
    "2. Track modifications made through their design workflow\n",
    "3. Allow customers to verify the authenticity of marketing materials\n",
    "4. Create a verification process for their creative team to ensure compliance\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate these capabilities, we'll explore how Content Credentials are:\n",
    "- Automatically embedded during image generation\n",
    "- Preserved and updated through editing operations\n",
    "- Verified using both programmatic tools and user-friendly interfaces\n"
