    "### Why This Matters\n",
    "- **Multi-model orchestration** - Demonstrates how different Nova models excel at different tasks\n",
    "- **Cost optimization** - Uses cheaper Nova Lite for simple shortening tasks\n",
    "- **Content fidelity** - Two-stage process maintains accuracy while achieving brevity\n",
    "- **Grade-level adaptation** - Bullet count and complexity automatically adjust\n",
