# Amazon Nova Act - Agentic Workflows

Amazon Nova Act is an early research preview of a Python SDK and model specifically designed for building agents that can reliably take actions in web browsers. This repository contains practical implementations and use cases demonstrating how Nova Act can be leveraged for real-world agentic workflows.

## What is Nova Act?

Nova Act enables developers to build intelligent agents that can interact with web applications autonomously. Unlike traditional automation that relies on brittle, script-based approaches, Nova Act agents can:

- **Observe and adapt** to UI changes dynamically
- **Make intelligent decisions** based on context and user intent
- **Execute complex workflows** by breaking them into reliable commands
- **Integrate seamlessly** with Python code for testing, assertions, and debugging

The SDK works in conjunction with **Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Browser**, a secure, cloud-based browser environment that provides:
- Session isolation and security
- Built-in observability (live viewing, CloudTrail logging, session replay)
- Containerized ephemeral environments
- Concurrent browser session support for parallel execution

## Use Cases

This repository demonstrates practical implementations of Nova Act for enterprise workflows:

### ðŸ§ª [Agentic QA Testing](./usecases/qa-testing/)

Automate quality assurance testing for web applications using Nova Act and AgentCore Browser. This use case showcases:

- **Intelligent test execution** that adapts to UI changes without brittle selectors
- **Parallel test execution** across multiple browser sessions for faster feedback
- **JSON-driven test definitions** that enable non-technical team members to create tests
- **Real-time observability** with live browser viewing and session replay
- **Integration with pytest** for comprehensive test reporting and CI/CD pipelines

**Key Benefits:**
- Reduce test maintenance overhead by 40-60%
- Execute comprehensive test suites in minutes instead of hours
- Eliminate false negatives from UI changes
- Scale testing across browsers, devices, and environments effortlessly

**What's Included:**
- Sample retail web application for testing
- 15 ready-to-use JSON test cases
- Pytest framework with parallel execution support
- CloudFormation templates for AWS deployment
- Complete setup and deployment instructions

## Why Agentic Workflows?

Traditional automation approaches face significant challenges:
- **High maintenance overhead**: Scripts break with UI changes, requiring constant updates
- **Limited scalability**: Manual testing is time-intensive and incomplete
- **Technical barriers**: Creating automation requires specialized programming knowledge
- **Brittleness**: Automation relies on specific selectors that fail when components change

Agentic AI with Nova Act addresses these challenges by:
- **Adapting dynamically** to interface changes without manual updates
- **Mimicking human interaction** patterns for realistic testing
- **Enabling non-technical users** to create tests through simple JSON definitions
- **Providing comprehensive coverage** without rigid, scripted pathways
