So , uh {disfmarker} uh , IBM transcription status ,\nprofessor d: IBM transcription . Uh , what else ?\ngrad f: \nprofessor d:  What 's SmartKom ? SmartKom ?\ngrad f: Uh , we wanna talk about if w if we wanna add the data to the mar Meeting Recorder corpus .\nphd e: The data . The data which we are collecting here .\nprofessor d: What {disfmarker} what {disfmarker} what are we collecting here ?\nphd e: Data ?\ngrad f: So why don't we have that on the agenda and we 'll {disfmarker} we 'll get to it and talk about it ?\nphd e: The SmartKom data ?\nprofessor d: Yeah , right .\nphd e: Yeah .\nprofessor d: Uh , right . Uh .\ngrad f: Uh , reorganization status .\nprofessor d: Reorganization status .\npostdoc a: Oh . Files and directories ?\nprofessor d: Files and directories .\ngrad f: Yep . Uh - huh . Absinthe , which is the multiprocessor UNIX {disfmarker} Linux . I think it was {pause} Andreas wanted to talk about segmentation and recognition , and update on SRI recognition experiments .\nprofessor d: Um {disfmarker}\ngrad f: And then if ti if there 's time I wanted to talk about digits , but it looked like we were pretty full , so I can wait till next week .\nprofessor d: Right . OK . Well , let 's see . I think the a certainly the segmentation and recognition we wanna maybe focus on when An - Andreas is here since that was particularly his thing .\nphd e: And also the SmartKom thing should b\nprofessor d: SmartKom also , Andreas . Absinthe , I think also he has sort of been involved in a lot of those things .\ngrad f: At least ,\nprofessor d: Yeah .\ngrad f: yeah , he 'll t he 'll probably be interested .\nprofessor d: Yeah .\ngrad f: But .\nprofessor d: Um So , I mean , I think they 'll be inter I 'll be interested in all this , but {disfmarker} but , uh , probably , if we had to pick something {pause} that we would talk on for ten minutes or so while they 're coming here . Or I guess it would be , you think , reorganization status , or {disfmarker} ?\ngrad f: Yeah . I mean , I think , Chuck was the one who added out the agenda item . I don't really have anything to say other than that we still haven't done it .\nphd b: Well , I mean , I uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} just basically that {disfmarker}\ngrad f: So .\nphd b: maybe I said {disfmarker} maybe we said this before {disfmarker} just that we met and we talked about it and we sort of have a plan for getting things organized and {disfmarker}\npostdoc a: And I {disfmarker} and I think a crucial part of that is the idea of {disfmarker} of not wanting to do it until right before the next level zero back - up so that there won't be huge number of {disfmarker} of added ,\nphd b: Right .\npostdoc a: uh {disfmarker}\ngrad f: Right .\nphd b: That {disfmarker} that was basically it . Not {disfmarker} not much @ @ {disfmarker}\ngrad f: Although Dave basically said that if we wanna do it , just tell him and he 'll do a d level zero then .\npostdoc a: Yeah . Uh - huh . Oh , excellent .\ngrad f: So .\npostdoc a: Oh , good .\nphd b: Oh , so maybe we should just go ahead and get everything ready , and {disfmarker}\ngrad f: Yep . So , I think we do need to talk a little bit about {disfmarker} Well , we don't need to do it during this meeting .\nphd b: Yeah .\ngrad f: We have a little more to discuss . But , uh , we 're {disfmarker} we 're basically ready to do it . And , uh , I have some web pages on ts {comment} more of the background . So , naming conventions and things like that , that I 've been trying to keep actually up to date . So . And I 've been sharing them with U - d UW folks also .\npostdoc a: I 'm sorry , you 've been what ? Showing them ?\nprofessor d: OK .\npostdoc a: Sharing them .\ngrad f: Sharing them with the UW folks .\npostdoc a: OK . OK .\nprofessor d: OK . Well , maybe uh , since that {disfmarker} that was a pretty short one , maybe we should talk about the IBM transcription status . Someone can {vocalsound} fill in Liz and Andreas later . Uh\ngrad f: OK . So , we , uh {disfmarker} we did another version of the beeps , where we separated each beeps with a spoken digit . Chuck came up here and recorded some di himself speaking some digits , and so it just goes \" beep one beep \" and then the phrase , and then \" beep two beep \" and then the phrase . And that seems pretty good . Um , I think they 'll have a b easier time keeping track of where they are in the file .\nphd e: And we have done that on the {pause} automatic segmentations .\ngrad f: And we did it with the automatic segmentation , and I don't think {disfmarker} We ne we didn't look at it in detail . We just sent it to IBM . We {disfmarker} we sorta spot - checked it .\nphd b: I listened to {pause} probably , uh , five or ten minutes of it from the beginning .\nphd e: Yeah .\ngrad f: Oh , really ?\nphd b: Yeah .\ngrad f: OK .\nphd b: And {disfmarker}\ngrad f: I sorta spot - checked here and there and it sounded pretty good . So . I think it 'll work .\nprofessor d: OK .\ngrad f: And , uh , we 'll just hafta see what we get back from them . Uh {disfmarker}\nphd b: And the main thing will be if we can align what they give us with what we sent them . I mean , that 's the crucial part .\ngrad f: Right .\nphd b: And I think we 'll be able to do that at {disfmarker} with this new beep format .\ngrad f: Yep . Well , I think it 's also they are much less likely to d have errors .\nphd b: Mm - hmm .\ngrad f: I mean , so the problem wi last time is that there were errors in the transcripts where they put beeps where there weren't any , or {disfmarker} and they put in extraneous beeps .\nphd b: Right . Yeah .\ngrad f: And with the numbers there , it 's much less likely .\nphd b: Yeah , one interesting note is {disfmarker} uh , or problem {disfmarker} I dunno if this was just because of how I play it back , I say , uh , SND - play and then the file , every once in a while , @ @ {comment} uh , like a beep sounds like it 's cut into two beeps .\nphd e: Yeah . Into two pieces .\nphd b: Yeah , and I {disfmarker} I dunno if that 's an , uh , artifact of playback {disfmarker}\nphd e: Yeah . Yep .\nphd b: bu uh , I don't think it 's probably in the original file . Um , but , uh {disfmarker}\nphd e: I recognize that , too . Yeah .\ngrad f: Ha . That 's interesting . I didn't hear that .\nphd b: Yeah . But with this new format , um , that hopefully they 're not hearing that , and if they are , it shouldn't throw them .\nphd e: Yep .\nphd b: So .\ngrad f: Well , maybe we better listen to it again , make sure , but , I mean , certainly the software shouldn't do that ,\nphd b: Yeah . That 's what I thought .\ngrad f: so .\npostdoc a: Mm - hmm .\nphd b: I it 's probably just , you know , mmm , somehow the audio {pause} device gets hung for a second ,\nphd e: Yeah . Some latency or something .\ngrad f: Hiccups .\nphd e: Yeah ?\npostdoc a: As long as they have one number , and they know that there 's only one beep maximum {vocalsound} that goes with that number .\nphd b: or {disfmarker}\nphd e: Yeah .\nphd b: Yeah . Right .\ngrad f: Yeah . The only {disfmarker} the only part that might be confusing is when Chuck is reading digits .\nphd b: Right .\nphd e: Yep .\npostdoc a: Well , you know , actually , are we having them {disfmarker}\nphd b: So {vocalsound} th\ngrad f: \" Seven four eight beep seven beep {vocalsound} eight three two \" .\npostdoc a: Yeah , but are we having them do digits ?\ngrad f: Yes . Because , uh , we don't {disfmarker} we didn't {disfmarker} In order to cut them out we 'd have to listen to it .\nphd b: We {disfmarker} we didn't cut those out .\nphd e: Yeah . They are not transcribed yet . So . Yeah .\npostdoc a: OK .\nphd e: Yeah .\ngrad f: And we wanted to avoid doing that ,\npostdoc a: OK .\ngrad f: so we {disfmarker} they are transcribing the digits .\npostdoc a: OK .\nphd b: We can {disfmarker} we can ignore it when we get it back ,\ngrad f: Although we could tell them {disfmarker} {comment} {vocalsound} we could tell them , if you hear someone reading a digits string just say \" bracket digit bracket \"\nphd b: huh .\ngrad f: and don't bother actually computing the di writing down the digits .\nphd b: Yeah .\npostdoc a: That 'd be great . That 'd be what I 'm having the transcribers here do , cuz it can be extracted later .\ngrad f: Yep . And then I wanted to talk about {disfmarker} but as I said I {disfmarker} we may not have time {disfmarker} what we should do about digits . We have a whole pile of digits that haven't been transcribed .\nprofessor d: Le - let 's talk about it , because that 's {disfmarker} that 's something that I {disfmarker} I know Andreas is less interested in than Liz is ,\ngrad f: OK .\nprofessor d: so , you know . It 's good {disfmarker}\ngrad f: Do we have anything else to say about transcription ? About IBM stuff ?\nphd b: Uh , Brian {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {vocalsound} sent bresset {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} sent Brian a message about {pause} {vocalsound} the meeting and I haven't heard back yet . So . I g hope he got it and hopefully he 's {disfmarker}\ngrad f: OK .\npostdoc a: Hmm .\nphd b: maybe he 's gone , I dunno . He didn't even reply to my message . So . I should probably ping him just to make sure that he got it . \ngrad f: Alright . So , we have a whole bunch of digits , if we wanna move on to digits .\nprofessor d: Actually , maybe I {disfmarker} One {disfmarker} one relate more related thing in transcription . So that 's the IBM stuff . We 've got that sorted out . Um , how 're we doing on the {disfmarker} on the rest of it ?\npostdoc a: We 're doing well . I {disfmarker} I hire {disfmarker} I 've hired two extra people already , expect to hire two more .\ngrad f: Hmm .\npostdoc a: And , um , {vocalsound} I 've prepared , um , uh , a set of five which I 'm {disfmarker} which I 'm calling set two , which are now being edited by my head transcriber , {vocalsound} in terms of spelling errors and all that . She 's also checking through and mar and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} and monitoring , um , the transcription of another transcriber . You know , I mean , she 's going through and doing these kinds of checks .\nprofessor d: Uh - huh .\npostdoc a: And , I 've moved on now to what I 'm calling set three . I sort of thought if I do it in sets {disfmarker} groups of five , then I can have , like , sort of a {disfmarker} a parallel processing through {disfmarker} through the {disfmarker} the current .\nprofessor d: Uh - huh .\npostdoc a: And {disfmarker} and you indicated to me that we have a g a goal now , {vocalsound} for the {disfmarker} for the , um , {nonvocalsound} {vocalsound} the , uh , DARPA demo , of twenty hours . So , I 'm gonna go up to twenty hours , be sure that everything gets processed , and released , and {disfmarker} {pause} {comment} and that 's {disfmarker} that 's what my goal is . Package of twenty hours right now , {vocalsound} and then once that 's done , move on to the next .\nprofessor d: Yeah , uh , so twenty hours . But I guess the other thing is that , um , that {disfmarker} that 's kinda twenty hours ASAP because the longer before the demo we actually have the twenty hours , the more time it 'll be for people to actually do cool things with it .\npostdoc a: Mm - hmm . Good . I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm hiring people who , {vocalsound} uh , really are {disfmarker}\nprofessor d: So . OK .\npostdoc a: They would like to do it full - time , several of these people . And {disfmarker} and I don't think it 's {vocalsound} possible , really , to do this full - time , but , that {disfmarker} what it shows is motivation to do as many hours as possible .\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm .\ngrad f: It 'll keep your accuracy up . Yep .\nprofessor d: Yeah .\npostdoc a: And they 're really excellent .\nprofessor d: Yeah . Well , that 's good .\npostdoc a: Yeah . Got a good core group now .\nprofessor d: Yeah , I mean , I guess the {disfmarker} So the difference if {disfmarker} if , um , if the IBM stuff works out , the difference in the job would be that they p primarily would be checking through things that were already done by someone else ?\npostdoc a: Again . Mm - hmm .\nprofessor d: Is that most of what it {disfmarker} ?\ngrad f: And correcting .\nprofessor d: I mean {disfmarker} Correcting .\ngrad f: Correcting . We 'll {disfmarker} we 'll expect that they 'll have to move some time bins and do some corrections .\npostdoc a: And I {disfmarker} you know , I 've also d uh , discovered {disfmarker} So with the new transcriber I 'm {disfmarker} um {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} Uh , lemme say that my , uh {disfmarker} So , um {disfmarker} At present , um , the people have been doing these transcriptions a channel at a time . And , that sort of , um , {vocalsound} is useful , and t you know , and then once in a while they 'll have to refer to the other channels to clear something up . OK . Well , {vocalsound} I realize that , um , w i we we 're using the pre - segmented version , and , um , the pre - segmented version is extremely useful , and wouldn't it be , useful also to have the visual representation of those segments ? And so I 've {disfmarker} {pause} uh , {pause} I , uh , uh , I 've {comment} trained the new one {disfmarker} uh , the new the newest one , {vocalsound} to , um , {vocalsound} use the visual from the channel that is gonna be transcribed at any given time . And that 's just amazingly helpful . Because what happens then , is you scan across the signal and once in a while you 'll find a blip that didn't show up in the pre - segmentation .\ngrad f: Oh , right .\npostdoc a: And that 'll be something like {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I it 's ver {disfmarker} it 's interesting .\ngrad f: I see what you mean . A backchannel , or {disfmarker}\npostdoc a: Once in a while it 's a backchannel .\nphd e: Yep .\npostdoc a: Sometimes it seems to be , um , similar to the ones that are being picked up .\ngrad f: Mm - hmm .\npostdoc a: And they 're rare events , but you can really go through a meeting very quickly . You just {disfmarker} you just , you know , yo you s you scroll from screen to screen , looking for blips . And , I think that we 're gonna end up with , uh {pause} better coverage of the backchannels ,\nprofessor d: Yeah .\npostdoc a: but at the same time we 're benefitting tremendously from the pre - segmentation because {vocalsound} there are huge places where there is just absolutely no activity at all . And , uh , the audio quality is so good {disfmarker}\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm .\nphd b: So they can {disfmarker} they can , um , scroll through that pretty quick ?\npostdoc a: Yeah . Mm - hmm .\nphd b: That 's great .\npostdoc a: Yeah . So I think that that 's gonna , also {pause} eh , {comment} you know , speed the efficiency of this part of the process .\nprofessor d: Hmm . OK . Uh , yeah . So , uh {disfmarker} Yeah . So let 's talk about the digits , since they 're not here yet .\ngrad f: Uh , so , we have a whole bunch of digits that we 've read and we have the forms and so on , um , but only a small number of that ha well , not a small number {disfmarker} only a subset of that has been transcribed . And so we need to decide what we wanna do . And , uh , Liz and Andreas {disfmarker} actually they 're not here , but , they did say at one point that they thought they could do a pretty good job of just doing a forced alignment . And , again , I don't think we 'll be able to do with that alone , because , um , sometimes people correct themselves and things like that . But {disfmarker} so , I was just wondering what people thought about how automated can we make the process of finding where the people read the digits , doing a forced alignment , and doing the timing .\nprofessor d: Well , forced alignment would be one thing . What about just actually doing recognition ?\ngrad f: Well , we {disfmarker} we know what they read , because we have the forms .\nprofessor d: No , they make mistakes .\ngrad f: Right . But , the point is that we wanna get a set of clean digits .\nphd b: You 're talking about as a pre - processing step .\nprofessor d: Right .\nphd b: Right , Morgan ?\nprofessor d: Um {disfmarker}\nphd b: Is that what you 're {disfmarker} ?\nprofessor d: Yeah , I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm not quite sure what I 'm talking about . I mean {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I mean , uh , we 're talking about digits now . And {disfmarker} and so , um , there 's a bunch of stuff that hasn't been marked yet . Uh . And , um , {vocalsound} there 's the issue that {disfmarker} that they {disfmarker} we know what {disfmarker} what was said , but do we ?\ngrad f: I mean , so one option i\nprofessor d: Because people make mistakes and stuff . I was just asking , just out of curiosity , if {disfmarker} if with , uh {disfmarker} uh , the SRI recognizer getting one percent word error , uh , would we {disfmarker} would we do {pause} better {disfmarker} ? So , if you do a forced alignment but the force but the {disfmarker} but the transcription you have is wrong because they actually made mistakes , uh , or {vocalsound} false starts , it 's {disfmarker} it 's much less c {vocalsound} it 's {pause} much less common than one percent ?\ngrad f: But that 's pretty uncommon . Um , if we could really get one percent on {disfmarker}\nprofessor d: We should be able to .\ngrad f: Well , I guess {disfmarker} yeah , I guess if we segmented it , we could get one percent on digits .\nprofessor d: Right ?\nphd b: Yeah .\nprofessor d: Yeah . So that 's just my question . I 'm not saying it should be one way or the other , but it 's {disfmarker} If {disfmarker}\ngrad f: But , Well , there {disfmarker} there 're a couple different of doing it . We could use the tools I 've already developed and transcribe it . Hire some people , or use the transcribers to do it . We could let IBM transcribe it . You know , they 're doing it anyway , and unless we tell them different , they 're gonna transcribe it . Um , or we could try some automated methods .\nprofessor d: Well {disfmarker}\ngrad f: And my {disfmarker} my tendency right now is , well , if IBM comes back with this meeting and the transcript is good , just let them do it .\nprofessor d: Yeah , it 's {disfmarker} Y you raised a point , kind of , uh , euphemistically {disfmarker} but , I mean , m maybe it is a serious problem . Ho - what will they do when they go {disfmarker} hear \" beep {pause} seven {pause} beep {pause} seven three five two \" {disfmarker} I mean , {vocalsound} you think they 'll {disfmarker} we 'll get {disfmarker} ?\ngrad f: It 's pretty distinct .\nprofessor d: Yeah ?\ngrad f: The beeps are {pause} pre - recorded .\nphd b: It 'll {comment} only be a problem for m for mine .\nphd e: Yeah .\npostdoc a: Well it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} well , it 'd be preceded by \" I 'm reading transcript so - and - so \" ?\nphd b: Yeah .\ngrad f: Yes .\npostdoc a: So , I think if they 're processing it at {disfmarker}\ngrad f: I mean , it 'll be {disfmarker} it will be in the midst of a digit string .\nprofessor d: Yeah .\ngrad f: So {disfmarker} I mean it {disfmarker} sure , there {disfmarker} there might be a place where it 's \" beep seven {pause} beep eight {pause} beep {pause} eight {pause} beep \" . But , you know , they {disfmarker} they 're {disfmarker} they 're gonna macros for inserting the beep marks . And so , I {disfmarker} I don't think it 'll be a problem . We 'll have to see , but I don't think it 's gonna be a problem .\nprofessor d: OK . Well , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I dunno , I {disfmarker} I think that that 's {disfmarker} if they are in fact going to transcribe these things , uh , certainly any process that we 'd have to correct them , or whatever is {disfmarker} needs to be much less elaborate for digits than for other stuff .\ngrad f: Right .\nprofessor d: So , why not ? Sure . That was it ?\ngrad f: That was it . Just , what do we do with digits ?\nprofessor d: OK .\ngrad f: We have so many of them , {vocalsound} and it 'd be nice to {pause} actually do something with them .\nprofessor d: Well , we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we wanna have them . Yeah , I {disfmarker}\nphd i: You mean there 're more than ten ?\ngrad f: Anything else ? Your mike is a little low there .\nprofessor d: I in Berkeley , yeah . So , {vocalsound} uh {pause} You {disfmarker} you have to go a little early , right ? At twenty {disfmarker}\nphd i: Well , I can stay till about , uh , three forty .\nprofessor d: Alright . So le let 's make sure we do the ones that {disfmarker} that , uh , saved you .\nphd i: Yeah . Mm - hmm .\nprofessor d: So there was some {disfmarker} Uh {pause} {vocalsound} In {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} Adam 's agenda list , he had something from you about segmentation this last recognition ?"}, {"chapter": 2, "start_ms": 1326000, "topic": "What to include in the meeting corpus and how to structure it", "transcript_text": "phd i: Well , yeah . So this is just partly to inform everybody , um , and {disfmarker} and of course to get , um , input .\ngrad f: Oops .\nphd i: Um , so , {nonvocalsound} uh , we had a discussion {disfmarker} Don and Liz and I had discussion last week about how to proceed with , uh , you know , with Don 's work ,\nphd e: Ch\nphd i: and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} and {disfmarker} and , uh , one of the obvious things that occur to us was that we 're {disfmarker} since we now have Thilo 's segmenter and it works , you know , amazingly well , {vocalsound} um , we should actually basically re - evaluate the recognition , um , results using {disfmarker} you know , without cheating on the segmentations .\nphd e: So {disfmarker}\nphd i: And , that should be fairly {disfmarker}\nphd e: And how do we find the transcripts for those so that {disfmarker} ? Yeah . The references for {disfmarker} for {pause} those segments ?\nphd i: Oh , OK . So , there 's actually {disfmarker}\nphd e: It 's not that {disfmarker}\nphd i: Why do you ask ?\ngrad f: I could {disfmarker}\nphd i: No , actually , um , NIST has , um m a fairly sophisticated scoring program {vocalsound} that you can give a , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} a time ,\ngrad f: Hand ones .\nphd g: Well {disfmarker}\nphd e: OK .\nphd i: uh {disfmarker} You know , you basically just give two {pause} time - marked sequences of words , and it computes the um {disfmarker} the , {comment} uh {disfmarker} {comment} you know , the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} th\nphd b: It does all the work for you .\nphd i: it does all the work for you .\nphd b: Yeah .\nphd e: OK .\nphd i: So , it {disfmarker} we just {disfmarker} and we use that actually in Hub - five to do the scoring . Um . So what we 've been using so far was sort of a {pause} simplified version of the scoring . And we can {disfmarker} we can handle the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the type of problem we have here .\nphd e: So , basically you give some time constraints for {disfmarker} for the references and for {disfmarker} for the hypothesis ,\nphd i: So , we ha Yeah . Right .\nphd e: and {disfmarker} Yeah , OK .\nphd g: Yeah .\nphd i: Right .\nphd g: Maybe the {pause} start of your speech and the end of it ,\nphd i: So do\nphd e: OK .\nphd g: or stuff like that .\nphd i: Right . It does time - constrained word - alignment .\nphd e: OK .\nphd i: So . So that should be possible . I mean that shouldn't be a problem . Uh , so that was the one thing , and the other was that , um {disfmarker} What was the other problem ? Oh ! That Thilo wanted to use {pause} the recognizer alignments to train up his , um , speech detector .\nphd e: Yeah .\nphd i: Um , so that we could use , uh {disfmarker} you know there wouldn't be so much hand {vocalsound} labelling needed to , uh {disfmarker} to generate training data for {disfmarker} for the speech detector .\nphd e: Yeah . I 'm just in progress of {disfmarker} of doing that . So .\nphd i: And I think you 're in the process of doing that .\nphd e: Yeah .\nphd i: So , you can {disfmarker} {comment} you can {disfmarker}\nphd b: It 'll give you a lot more data , too . Won't it ?\nphd e: Yeah . So , it 's basically {disfmarker} s I think , eight meetings or something which {disfmarker} which I 'm using , and , {vocalsound} it 's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} before it was twenty minutes of one meeting .\nphd i: Mm - hmm .\nphd e: So {disfmarker} should {comment} be a little bit better .\nphd i: Right .\nphd b: Great .\nphd i: That won't be perfect {disfmarker} the alignments aren't perfect ,\nphd e: Yeah . But {disfmarker}\nphd i: but , um , it 's probably still better to have all this extra data , than {disfmarker}\nphd g: Yeah .\nphd e: Yeah . Yep .\nphd i: Yeah .\nphd e: We 'll see that .\nphd i: Yeah .\nprofessor d: OK .\nphd g: Actually , I had a question about that . If you find that you can {vocalsound} lower the false alarms that you get where there 's no speech , that would be useful {pause} for us to know . So , um {disfmarker}\nphd e: There were the false alarms .\nphd g: Yeah . So , {vocalsound} r right now you get f fal you know , false {disfmarker} false , uh , speech regions when it 's just like , um , {vocalsound} breath or something like that ,\nphd e: OK . Yeah . Yep .\nphd g: and I 'd be interested to know the {disfmarker} wha if you retrain um ,\nphd e: Yeah .\nphd g: do those actually go down or not ? Because {pause} of {disfmarker}\nphd e: Yeah . I 'll {disfmarker} can make {disfmarker} an can , like , make a c comparison of {disfmarker} of the old system to the {disfmarker} to the new one , and {pause} then {disfmarker}\nphd g: Yeah , just to see if by doing nothing in the modeling of {disfmarker} just having that training data wh what happens .\nphd e: Yeah . Yeah . Yep .\nprofessor d: Um another one that we had on Adam 's agenda {pause} that definitely involved you was s something about SmartKom ?\ngrad f: Right . So , Rob Porzel {disfmarker} eh , Porzel ? and the , uh {disfmarker} Porzel {disfmarker} and the , uh , SmartKom group are collecting some dialogues .\nphd i: Porzel . Porzel .\ngrad f: Basically they have one person sitting in here , looking at a picture , and a wizard sitting in another room somewhere . And , uh , they 're doing a travel task . And , uh , it involves starting {disfmarker} I believe starting with a {disfmarker} It 's {disfmarker} it 's always the wizard , but it starts where the wizard is pretending to be a computer and it goes through a , uh , {vocalsound} speech generation system .\nphd e: Yeah . Actually , it 's changed to a synthesis for {disfmarker} for the first part now .\ngrad f: Synthesis system .\nphd e: Yeah .\ngrad f: Um , and then , it goes to a real wizard and they 're evaluating that . And they wanted to use this equipment , and so the w question came up , is {disfmarker} well , here 's some more data . Should this be part of the corpus or not ? And my attitude was yes , because there might be people who are using this corpus for {pause} acoustics , as opposed to just for language . Um , or also for dialogue of various sorts . Um , so it 's not a meeting . Right ? Because it 's two people and they 're not face to face .\nprofessor d: Wait a minute . So , I just wanted to understand it , cuz I {disfmarker} I 'm {disfmarker} uh , hadn't quite followed this process .\nphd e: Yeah .\nprofessor d: Um . So , it 's wizard in the sen usual sense that the person who is asking the questions doesn't know that it 's , uh , a machi not a machine ?\nphd i: Right .\ngrad f: At the beginning .\nphd i: Actually {disfmarker} actually , w w the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} We do this {disfmarker} I dunno who came up with it , but I think it 's a really clever idea . We simulate a computer breakdown halfway through the session , and so then after that , the person 's told that they 're now talking to a , uh {disfmarker} to a human .\nprofessor d: Yeah .\nphd e: It 's a human operator .\nprofessor d: Yeah .\nphd e: Yeah .\ngrad f: But of course they don't know that it 's the same person both times .\nphd i: So , we {disfmarker} we collect {disfmarker} we collect both human - computer and human - human data , essentially , in the same session .\nprofessor d: You might wanna try collecting it the other way around sometime , saying that th the computer isn't up yet\npostdoc a: Hmm .\nprofessor d: and then {disfmarker} so then you can separate it out whether it 's the beginning or end kind of effects .\nphd i: That 's an idea .\nprofessor d: But , yeah .\ngrad f: Yep .\nphd i: Yeah .\npostdoc a: That 's a good idea .\ngrad f: \" I have to go now . You can talk to the computer . \"\nphd b: It 's a lot more believable , too ,\ngrad f: \" No ! \"\nphd b: if you tell them that they 're {disfmarker} the computer part is running on a Windows machine . And the whole breakdown thing kinda makes sense .\nphd i: O Just {disfmarker} just reboot it .\ngrad f: Abort {disfmarker} abort , retry , fail ?\nphd g: So did they actually save the far - field {pause} data ?\nphd e: Yes .\ngrad f: Well , this was {disfmarker} this was the question .\nphd g: Cuz at first they weren't {disfmarker} they weren't sa\nphd i: Yeah .\ngrad f: So {disfmarker} so they were saying they were not going to ,\nphd e: Yeah .\nphd g: OK .\ngrad f: and I said , \" well that 's silly , if {disfmarker} if we 're gonna try to do it for a corpus , there might be people who are interested in acoustics . \"\nphd g: Yeah .\nphd i: Wow .\nphd e: No .\nphd g: Or {disfmarker}\nphd e: projector {comment} We were not saying we are not {pause} doing it .\nphd g: Yeah .\nprofessor d: S\nphd e: We wer we just wanted to do {disfmarker}\nphd i: No , the {disfmarker} the question is do we save one or two far - field channels or all of them ?\nphd g: Right .\nphd e: Yeah . Yeah .\ngrad f: I {disfmarker} I see no reason not to do all of them .\nprofessor d: Um {disfmarker}\ngrad f: That {disfmarker} that if we have someone who is doing acoustic studies , uh , it 's nice to have the same for every recording .\nphd g: Nnn . Yeah .\nphd i: Hmm .\nprofessor d: So , what is the purpose of this recording ?\nphd i: Mm - hmm .\nprofessor d: This is to get acoustic and language model training data for SmartKom. OK .\nphd i: It 's to be traini to b training data and development data for the SmartKom {pause} system .\nphd e: The English system ? Yeah .\nphd i: Yeah . Right . Right .\nphd b: Where does this {disfmarker} ?\nprofessor d: \nphd g: Maybe we can have him vary the microphones , too ,\nprofessor d: Well ,\nphd e: B\nphd g: or they 're different s speakers .\ngrad f: Right . So {disfmarker} so {disfmarker} so for their usage , they don't need anything .\nprofessor d: so why not {disfmarker} ?\nphd e: Yeah .\ngrad f: Right ?\nphd e: But {disfmarker} but I 'm not sure about the legal aspect of {disfmarker} of that . Is {disfmarker} is there some contract with SmartKom or something about the data ?\nphd i: Yeah .\nphd e: What they {disfmarker} or , is {disfmarker} is that our data which we are collecting here ,\nprofessor d: We 've never signed anything that said that we couldn't use anything that we did .\nphd e: or {disfmarker} ? OK . OK .\nphd i: We weren't supposed to collect any data .\nphd e: So . OK .\nprofessor d: Yeah .\nphd e: So . Yeah , th th that was the question .\nphd i: This was all {disfmarker}\nphd e: If {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} ? Yeah .\nphd i: Yeah .\nprofessor d: No that 's not a problem .\nphd e: Basically .\nprofessor d: I {disfmarker} L look , it seems to me that if we 're doing it anyway and we 're doing it for these {disfmarker} these purposes that we have , {vocalsound} and we have these distant mikes , we definitely should re should save it all as long as we 've got disk space ,\nphd i: Mm - hmm .\nprofessor d: and disk is pretty cheap .\nphd i: OK .\nprofessor d: So should we save it ?\ngrad f: And then {disfmarker}\nprofessor d: Now th Yeah . So we save it because it 's {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it 's potentially useful . And now , what do we do with it is {disfmarker} is a s separate question .\ngrad f: Right .\nprofessor d: I mean , anybody who 's training something up could {vocalsound} choose to put it {disfmarker} eh , to u include this or not .\nphd i: Right .\nprofessor d: I {disfmarker} I would not say it was part of the meetings corpus . It isn't . But it 's some other data we have , and if somebody doing experiment wants to train up including that then they can . Right ?\nphd i: Mm - hmm .\ngrad f: So it 's {disfmarker} It {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} I guess it {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} begs the question of what is the meeting corpus . So if , at UW they start recording two - person hallway conversations is that part of the meeting corpus ?\nprofessor d: I think it 's {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think {disfmarker} I th think the idea of two or more people conversing with one another is key .\ngrad f: Well , this has two or more people conversing with each other .\nprofessor d: Nnn , well\nphd e: Yeah .\npostdoc a: Well this {disfmarker}\ngrad f: They 're just not face to face .\nphd g: What if we just give it a {disfmarker} a name like we give these meetings a name ?\nprofessor d: No , it doesn't . Right ? It has {disfmarker}\ngrad f: I mean , that was my intention .\nphd g: And then later on some people will consider it a meeting and some people won't ,\npostdoc a: Well this {disfmarker}\nprofessor d: Yeah .\ngrad f: That was my intention . So {disfmarker} so {disfmarker} s {vocalsound} so part of the reason that I wanted to bring this up is , {vocalsound} do we wanna handle it as a special case or do we wanna fold it in ,\nphd g: and {disfmarker} Just give it a {vocalsound} title .\npostdoc a: Oh .\nprofessor d: I think it is a s\ngrad f: we give everyone who 's involved as their own user ID , give it session I Ds , {vocalsound} let all the tools that handle Meeting Recorder handle it , or do we wanna special case it ? And if we were gonna special case it , who 's gonna do that ?\nphd e: So .\nphd i: Well , it {disfmarker} it makes sense to handle it with the same infrastructure , since we don't want to duplicate things unnecessarily .\nphd e: It {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker}\npostdoc a: I think {disfmarker}\nphd i: But as far as distributing it , we shouldn't label it as part of this meeting corpus .\nprofessor d: Yeah .\nphd i: We should let it be its own corp\npostdoc a: Well it 's {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} well , because {disfmarker}\ngrad f: I don't see why not . It 's just a different topic .\npostdoc a: I ha I have an extra point , which is the naturalness issue . Because we have , like , meetings that have a reason . That 's one of the reasons that we were talking about this . And {disfmarker} and those {disfmarker} and this sounds like it 's more of an experimental setup .\nprofessor d: Yeah .\npostdoc a: It 's got a different purpose .\nprofessor d: It 's scenario - based , it 's {disfmarker} it 's human - computer interface {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it 's really pretty different .\npostdoc a: Yeah .\nprofessor d: But I I {disfmarker} I have no problem with somebody folding it in for some experiment they 're gonna do , but I don't think i it {disfmarker} it doesn't match anything that we 've described about meetings .\ngrad f: Mm - hmm .\nprofessor d: Whereas everything that we talked about them doing at {disfmarker} at UW and so forth really does . They 're actually talking {disfmarker}\ngrad f: OK . So w so what does that mean for how we are gonna organize things ?\npostdoc a: Hmm .\nphd e: Yeah .\nprofessor d: You can {disfmarker} you can {disfmarker} Again , as {disfmarker} as I think Andreas was saying , {vocalsound} if you wanna use the same tools and the same conventions , there 's no problem with that . It 's just that it 's , you know , different directory , it 's called something different , it 's {disfmarker} you know . It is different . You can't just fold it in as if it 's {disfmarker} I mean , digits are different , too . Right ?\ngrad f: Yeah , but those are folded in ,\nphd i: It might also be potentially confusing .\ngrad f: and it 's just {disfmarker} you just mark the transcripts differently . So {disfmarker} so one option is you fold it in ,\nphd i: Right .\ngrad f: and just simply in the file you mark somewhere that this is this type of interaction , rather than another type of interaction .\nphd i: Yeah , I th\nprofessor d: Well , I don I wouldn't call reading digits \" meetings \" . Right ? I mean , we {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} we were doing {disfmarker}\ngrad f: Well , but {disfmarker} but , {vocalsound} I put it under the same directory tree .\nprofessor d: Well {disfmarker}\ngrad f: You know , it 's in \" user doctor speech data MR \" .\nphd g: Can we just have a directory called , like , \" other stuff \" ?\ngrad f: Other .\nphd g: And {disfmarker} Well {disfmarker} or , I dunno .\nprofessor d: I mean , I don't care what directory tree you have it under .\nphd g: And {disfmarker} {vocalsound} and just , um , store it there .\nprofessor d: Right ? I mean that 's just a {disfmarker}\ngrad f: OK . My preference is to have a single procedure so that I don't have to think too much about things .\nphd i: Yes .\nphd g: I mean {disfmarker}\nprofessor d: Yeah .\ngrad f: And , just have a marking .\nprofessor d: O - You {disfmarker} you can use whatever procedure you want that 's p convenient for you .\ngrad f: If we do it any other way that means that we need a separate procedure , and someone has to do that .\nprofessor d: All I 'm saying is that there 's no way that we 're gonna tell people that reading digits is meetings . And similarly we 're not gonna tell them that someone talking to a computer to get travel information is meetings .\ngrad f: Right .\nprofessor d: Those aren't meetings . But if it makes it easier for you to pu fold them in the same procedures and have them under the same directory tree , knock yourself out .\nphd b: There 's a couple other questions that I have too ,\nprofessor d: You know ?\nphd b: and {disfmarker} and {pause} one of them is , what about , uh , consent issues ? And the other one is , what about transcription ? Are {disfmarker} ?\nphd e: Transcription is done in Munich .\nphd b: OK . So we don't have to worry about transcribing it ?\nprofessor d: Alright .\nphd e: Yeah .\ngrad f: So , w we will hafta worry about format .\nphd i: That 's a {disfmarker} that 's another argument to keep it separate , because it 's gonna follow the SmartKom transcription conventions and not the ICSI meeting transcription conventions .\nphd e: Yeah .\ngrad f: Oh , OK .\nprofessor d: Ah . Good point .\ngrad f: OK . Well , I didn't realize that . That 's {disfmarker} that 's a {disfmarker}\nprofessor d: Good point . But I 'm sure no one would have a problem with our folding it in for some acoustic modeling or {disfmarker} or some things . Um . Do we h do we have , uh , um , American - born folk , uh , reading German {disfmarker} German , uh , pla uh , place names and so forth ? Is that {disfmarker} ?\nphd e: Yeah .\nphd i: Exactly .\nprofessor d: Yeah , great .\nphd e: Yeah .\ngrad f: Yep ."}, {"chapter": 3, "start_ms": 2928000, "topic": "Issues with data storage", "transcript_text": "phd i: Do you wanna be a subject ?\nprofessor d: Yeah , I be pretty good .\nphd i: We {disfmarker} Yeah .\ngrad f: We 're about {disfmarker} we 're about half {disfmarker} halfway through our disk right now .\nphd b: Yeah .\nphd i: That was one of our concerns .\nphd b: Are we only half ? I thought we were more than that .\ngrad f: We 're probably a little more than that because we 're using up some space that we shouldn't be on . So , once everything gets converted over to the disks we 're supposed to be using we 'll be probably , uh , seventy - five percent .\nphd b: Well , when I was looking for space for Thilo , I found one disk that had , uh , I think it was nine gigs and another one had seventeen .\ngrad f: Yep .\nphd b: And everything else was sorta committed . Uh {disfmarker}\ngrad f: Were those backed - up or non - backed - up ?\nphd b: Those were non - backed - up .\nphd e: Non - back - up .\ngrad f: Right . So that 's different .\nphd b: S oh , you 're talking about backed - up .\ngrad f: I 'm much more concerned about the backed - up . The non - backed - up ,\nphd b: I haven't looked to see how much of that we have .\ngrad f: yeah , i is cheap . I mean , if we need to we can buy a disk , hang it off a s uh , workstation . If it 's not backed - up the sysadmins don't care too much .\nprofessor d: Yeah . So , I mean , pretty much anytime we need a disk , we can get it at the rate that we 're {disfmarker}\nphd i: You can {disfmarker} I shouldn't be saying this , but , you can just {disfmarker} you know , since the back - ups are every night , you can recycle the backed - up diskspace .\ngrad f: Yeah . But that 's {disfmarker} that 's {disfmarker} {pause} that 's risky .\nprofessor d: Yeah . You really shouldn't be saying {disfmarker}\ngrad f: Mmm . Mmm .\nphd i: I didn't say that .\ngrad f: Yeah , that 's right .\nphd i: I didn't say that .\ngrad f: Beep that out .\nprofessor d: Da - we had allowed Dave to listen to these {disfmarker} {vocalsound} these , {vocalsound} uh , recordings .\nphd i: Right .\nprofessor d: Um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah , I me and there 's been this conversation going on about getting another file server , and {disfmarker} and {vocalsound} we can do that .\nphd i: Mm - hmm .\nprofessor d: We 'll take the opportunity and get another big raft of {disfmarker} {vocalsound} of disk , I guess .\ngrad f: Yeah . It 's really the back - up issue rather than the file server issue .\nphd i: Well , I think {disfmarker} {comment} I think there 's an argument for having {disfmarker} you know , you could use our old file server for {disfmarker} for disks that have data that {pause} is very rarely accessed , and then have a fast new file server for data that is , um , heavily accessed .\ngrad f: Yeah . My understanding is , the issue isn't really the file server .\nphd i: Yeah .\ngrad f: We could always put more disks on .\nphd i: Yeah . It 's the back it 's the back - up capaci\ngrad f: It 's the back - up system .\nphd i: Yeah .\ngrad f: So {disfmarker} which is near saturation , apparently . So .\nphd b: I think {disfmarker} I think the file server could become an issue as we get a whole bunch more new compute machines .\nprofessor d: Soon .\nphd b: And we 've got , you know , fifty machines trying to access data off of Abbott at once .\ngrad f: Well , we 're alright for now because the network 's so slow .\nphd i: I mean , I think {disfmarker} I think we 've raised this before and someone said this is not a reliable way to do it , but the {disfmarker} What about putting the stuff on , like , C - CD - ROM or DVD or something ?\ngrad f: Yeah . That was me . I was the one who said it was not reliable . The - they {disfmarker} they wear out .\nphd i: OK . Oh , OK .\ngrad f: Yeah . The {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} th\nphd i: But they wear out just from sitting on the shelf ?\ngrad f: Yep . Absolutely .\nphd i: Or from being {pause} read and read ?\ngrad f: No . Read and write don't hurt them too much unless you scratch them .\nphd i: Oh , OK .\ngrad f: But the r the write once , and the read - writes , don't last . So you don't wa you don't wanna put ir un reproduceable data {pause} on them .\nphd i: Uh - huh .\nphd b: Wear out after what amount of time ?\ngrad f: Year or two .\npostdoc a: Would it be {disfmarker} ?\nprofessor d: Year or two ?\ngrad f: Yep .\nprofessor d: Wow .\npostdoc a: Hmm .\nphd i: But if that {disfmarker} then you would think you 'd {pause} hear much more clamoring about data loss\nphd e: Yeah .\nphd i: and {disfmarker}\nprofessor d: I mean , yeah , all the L\ngrad f: I {disfmarker} I don't know many people who do it on CD . I mean , they 're {disfmarker} the most {disfmarker} fo\nprofessor d: LDC - all the LDC distributions are on CD - ROM .\nphd g: Yeah .\ngrad f: They 're on CD , but they 're not {disfmarker} tha that 's not the only source .\nphd g: Like {disfmarker}\ngrad f: They have them on disk . And they burn new ones every once in a while . But if you go {disfmarker} {vocalsound} if you go k\nphd i: But , you know , we have {disfmarker}\nphd g: But we have like thirty {pause} you know , from {pause} ten years ago ?\nprofessor d: We have all sorts of CD - ROMs from a long time ago .\nphd g: No .\nphd e: Yeah .\nphd g: Yeah !\ngrad f: Well , th th OK .\nphd g: Ten years ago .\nphd i: Right .\nphd g: Ninety - one , and they 're still all fine .\nprofessor d: Yeah .\ngrad h: Were they burned or were they pressed ?\nphd g: Uh , both . I 've burned them and they 're still OK .\ngrad h: Yeah .\ngrad f: The {disfmarker} the pressed ones last for\nphd g: I mean , usually they 're {disfmarker}\ngrad f: well , not forever , they 've been finding even those degrade .\nprofessor d: Oh , I see .\ngrad f: But , uh , the burned ones {disfmarker} I mean , when I say two or three years what I 'm saying is that I have had disks which are gone in a year .\nphd g: That 's what I {disfmarker}\ngrad f: On the average , it 'll probably be three or four years . But , uh {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} you don't want to per p have your only copy on a media that fails .\nphd i: Mmm .\ngrad f: And they do . Um , if you have them professionally pressed , y you know , they 're good for decades .\nphd i: So how about {disfmarker} ? So {disfmarker} so how about putting them on that plus , like on a {disfmarker} on {disfmarker} on DAT or some other medium that isn't risky ?\ngrad f: I think th um , we can already put them on tape . And the tape is hi is very reliable .\nphd i: OK . Mm - hmm .\ngrad f: So the {disfmarker} the only issue is then {pause} if we need access to them . So that 's fine f if we don't need access to them .\nphd i: Right . Well , if {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if you {disfmarker} if they last {disfmarker} Say , they actually last , like , five years , huh , in {disfmarker} in the typical case , and {disfmarker} and occasionally you might need to recreate one , and then you get your tape out , but otherwise you don't . Can't you just {disfmarker} you just put them on {disfmarker} ?\ngrad h: So you just archive it on the tape , and then put it on CD as well ?\nphd i: Yeah . Right .\ngrad f: Oh . So you 're just saying put them on C Ds for normal access .\ngrad h: Yeah .\nphd i: Right .\nphd b: What you {disfmarker}\ngrad f: Yeah . I mean , you can do that but that 's pretty annoying , because the C Ds are so slow .\nphd g: See {disfmarker} Yeah .\ngrad h: Yeah .\nphd i: Mmm .\nphd b: What 'd be nice is a system that re - burned the C Ds every {vocalsound} year .\nphd g: H everytime it was a \" gonna \" {disfmarker} \" gonna die \" .\nprofessor d: Well {disfmarker}\ngrad f: Well , I mean , the C Ds are {disfmarker} are an op\nphd e: Yeah .\nphd i: It 's like {disfmarker} like dynamic ra DRAM .\nphd e: Just before .\nphd b: Yeah .\nphd g: Just before they be before it goes bad , it burns them in .\ngrad f: The {disfmarker} the CD is an alternative to tape .\ngrad h: Yeah .\ngrad f: ICSI already has a perfectly good tape system and it 's more reliable .\nprofessor d: You know {disfmarker} I would think {disfmarker}\ngrad f: So for archiving , we 'll just use tape .\nphd i: One {disfmarker} one thing I don't understand is , if you have the data {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if you if the meeting data is put on disk exactly once , then it 's backed - up once and the back - up system should never have to bother with it , uh , more than once .\ngrad f: Well , regardless {disfmarker} Well , first of all there was , um , a problem with the archive in that I was every once in a while doing a chmod on all the directories an or recursive chmod and chown , because {vocalsound} they weren't getting set correctly every once in a while ,\nphd i: Mm - hmm .\ngrad f: and I was just , {vocalsound} doing a minus R star , {vocalsound} not realizing that that caused {pause} it to be re - backed - up .\nphd i: Mm - hmm .\nphd g: Ah .\ngrad f: But normally you 're correct . But even without that , the back - up system is becoming saturated .\nphd i: But {disfmarker} but this back - up system is smart enough to figure out that something hasn't changed and doesn't need to be {pause} backed - up again .\nprofessor d: The b I think th the {disfmarker} at least the once tha that you put it on , it would {disfmarker} {vocalsound} it would {comment} {vocalsound} kill that .\ngrad f: Sure , but we still have enough changed that the nightly back - ups are starting to take too long .\nphd i: OK . So {disfmarker} so then , if {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} so then , let 's {disfmarker}\nprofessor d: So .\ngrad f: It has nothing to do with the meeting . It 's just the general ICSI back - up system is becoming saturated .\nphd i: Right . OK . Right . So , what if we buy , uh {disfmarker} uh , what {disfmarker} what do they call these , um {pause} high density {disfmarker} ?\ngrad f: Well , why don't you have this {disfmarker} have a {disfmarker} this conversation with Dave Johnson tha rather than with me ?\nphd i: No , no . Because this is {pause} maybe something that we can do without involving Dave , and {disfmarker} and , putting more burden on him . How about we buy , uh {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} uh , one of these high density tape drives ? And we put the data actually on non - backed - up disks . And we do our own back - up once and for all {disfmarker} all , and then {disfmarker} and we don't have to bother this @ @ up ?\ngrad f: Actually , you know , we could do that just with the tape {disfmarker} with the current tape .\nphd i: I dunno what the these tapes {disfmarker} uh , at some point these {disfmarker} I dunno . What kind of tape drive is it ?\ngrad f: I dunno but it 's an automatic robot so it 's very convenient .\nphd i: Is it {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} ?\nprofessor d: Wh The o the one that we have ?\ngrad f: You just run a program to restore them .\nphd i: Right .\nprofessor d: The {disfmarker} I mean {disfmarker}\ngrad f: Yeah .\nphd i: But it might interfere with their back - up schedule ,\nphd g: But {disfmarker}\nprofessor d: No , we have s we {disfmarker} Don't we have our own ?\nphd i: eh .\nprofessor d: Something wi th that doesn't {disfmarker} that isn't used by the back - up gang ? Don't we have something downstairs ?\npostdoc a: Well they {disfmarker}\nphd b: What kinda tape drive ?\nprofessor d: Just in {disfmarker} ? Yeah .\ngrad f: Well {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} no , but Andreas 's point is a good one . And we don't have to do anything ourselves to do that . They 're already right now on tape .\nphd i: Right .\ngrad f: Right . So your {disfmarker} your point is , and I think it 's a good one , that we could just get more disk and put it there .\nphd i: Mmm . On an XH {disfmarker} uh , X {disfmarker} X whatever partition .\ngrad f: Yeah . That 's not a bad idea .\nphd i: Yeah .\nprofessor d: Yeah , that 's basically what I was gonna say , is that a disk is {disfmarker} is so cheap it 's es essentially , you know , close to free . And the only thing that costs is the back - up {pause} issue , {vocalsound} eh , to first order .\ngrad f: So once it 's on tape {disfmarker}\nphd i: Right . Right .\nprofessor d: And we can take care of that by putting it on non - back {pause} up drives and just backing it up once onto this tape .\nphd i: Mm - hmm .\ngrad f: I think that 's a good idea .\nphd i: Right .\nprofessor d: Oh . Yeah .\nphd i: OK .\nprofessor d: Good . It 's good .\nphd g: So , who 's gonna do these back - ups ? The people that collect it ?\ngrad f: Uh Well , I 'll talk to Dave , and {disfmarker} and see what th how {disfmarker} {nonvocalsound} what the best way of doing that is .\nphd b: It 's probably gonna n\ngrad f: There 's a little utility that will manually burn a tape for you , and that 's probably the right way to do it .\nphd b: Yeah , and we should probably make that part of the procedure for recording the meetings .\nphd g: Well , s\ngrad f: Yep .\nphd g: Yeah . That 's what I 'm wondering , if {disfmarker}\ngrad f: Well {pause} we 're g we 're gonna automate that .\nphd g: OK .\ngrad f: My intention is to {pause} do a script that 'll do everything .\nphd g: I mean , you don't have to physically put a tape in the drive ?\ngrad f: No . It 's all tape robot ,\nphd g: Or s ? s ? {comment} Oh , OK .\ngrad f: so you just sit down at your computer and you type a command .\nphd g: So it 's just {disfmarker} Oh , OK .\nphd i: Yeah , but then you 're effectively using the resources of the back - up system . Or is that a different tape robot ?\ngrad f: Yeah .\nphd g: But not at the same time .\ngrad f: But y but you would be anyway .\nphd b: No , no , no .\ngrad f: Right ?\nphd b: He 's saying get a whole different drive .\ngrad f: Because {disfmarker}\nphd i: No , no . See {disfmarker}\ngrad f: But there 's no reason to do that .\nphd i: Yeah , just give a dedi\ngrad f: It {disfmarker} we already have it there and it {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker}\nphd i: Well , I 'm saying is @ @ i if you go to Dave , and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and ask him \" can I use your tape robot ? \" , he will say , \" well {pause} that 's gonna screw up our back - up operation . \"\ngrad f: No , we won't . He 'll say \" if {disfmarker} if that means {pause} that it 's not gonna be backed - up standardly , great . \"\nprofessor d: He - I {disfmarker} Dave has {disfmarker} has promoted this in the past . So I don't think he 's actually against it .\ngrad f: Yeah . It 's {disfmarker} it 's definitely no problem .\nphd i: Oh , OK . Alright .\nprofessor d: Yeah .\nphd i: Alright .\nprofessor d: OK .\nphd i: Good .\nphd g: What about if the times overlap with the normal back - up time ?\ngrad f: Um , it 's {disfmarker} it 's just {disfmarker} it 's just a utility which queues up . It just queues it up and {disfmarker} and when it 's available , it will copy it .\nphd g: OK .\nprofessor d: Yeah .\ngrad f: And then you can tell it to then remove it from the disk or you can , you know , do it a a few days later or whatever you wanna do , after you confirm that it 's really backed - up .\nphd g: OK .\ngrad f: NW {disfmarker} ?\npostdoc a: You saying NW archive ?\ngrad f: NW archive .\npostdoc a: Yep {comment} {vocalsound} And if you did that during the day it would never make it to the nightly back - ups .\ngrad f: That 's what it is .\nprofessor d: OK .\ngrad f: Right .\npostdoc a: And then there wouldn't be this extra load .\nphd i: Well , it {disfmarker} if he {disfmarker} you have to put the data on a {disfmarker} on a non - backed - up disk to begin with .\npostdoc a: Well , but you can have it NW archive to {disfmarker} you can have , {vocalsound} uh , a non - backed - up disk NW archived ,\ngrad f: Right .\nphd i: So that {disfmarker} so that {disfmarker} otherwise you don't {disfmarker} you {disfmarker}\npostdoc a: and it 'll never show up on the nightly back - ups .\ngrad f: Right . And then it never {disfmarker}\nphd i: Right . Right .\ngrad f: Right . Which I 'm sure would make ever the sysadmins very happy .\nphd i: Right .\npostdoc a: Yeah .\ngrad f: So , I think that 's a good idea .\nphd i: OK .\ngrad f: That 's what we should do .\nphd i: OK .\ngrad f: So , that means we 'll probably wanna convert all {disfmarker} all those files {disfmarker} filesystems to non - backed - up media .\nphd b: That sounds good .\nprofessor d: Yeah ."}, {"chapter": 4, "start_ms": 4398000, "topic": "Modeling meeting data", "transcript_text": "phd i: SRI recognition ? Oh .\ngrad f: That wasn't me .\nprofessor d: Uh .\nphd i: Um . well ,\nprofessor d: Who 's that ?\nphd i: we have lots of them . Uh , I dunno . Chuck , do you have any {disfmarker} any updates ?\nphd b: N I 'm successfully , uh , increasing the error rate . Uh {disfmarker}\ngrad f: That 's good .\ngrad h: Mmm .\nphd i: Oh .\nphd g: Lift the Herve approach .\nphd b: Yeah . So , I mean I 'm just playing with , um , the number of Gaussians that we use in the {disfmarker} the recognizer , and {disfmarker}\nphd i: Well , you have to sa you have to {pause} tell people that you 're {disfmarker} you 're doing {disfmarker} you 're trying the tandem features .\nphd b: Yes , I 'm using tandem features .\ngrad f: Oh you are ?\nphd b: And {disfmarker}\ngrad f: Cool .\nphd i: A and I 'm still tinkering with the PLP features .\ngrad f: \nprofessor d: Yeah , I got confused by the results . It sai because {disfmarker} uh , the {pause} meeting before , {vocalsound} you said \" OK , we got it down to where they 're {disfmarker} they 're within a tenth of a percent \" .\nphd b: That was on males .\nphd i: Right . That was {disfmarker} that was before I tried it on the females .\nprofessor d: Oh .\nphd i: See , women are nothi are , trouble .\nprofessor d: It 's the women are the problem . OK .\nphd i: Right ? As we all know . So .\nphd g: Well , let 's just say that men are simple .\nphd i: So {disfmarker} {comment} so , when {disfmarker} So I {disfmarker} I had {disfmarker} I ha\ngrad f: That was a quick response .\nphd i: So , we had reached the point where {disfmarker}\nphd g: I 'm well rehearsed .\nprofessor d: Yeah .\nphd i: we had reached the point where , {comment} um , on the male portion of the {pause} development set , the , um {disfmarker} or one of the development sets , I should say {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the , um {disfmarker} the male error rate with , uh , ICSI PLP features was pretty much identical with , uh , SRI features . which are {pause} MFCC . So , um , then I thought , \" Oh , great . I 'll j I 'll {disfmarker} just let 's make sure everything works on the females . \" And the error rate {disfmarker} you know , there was a three percent difference .\nprofessor d: Oh . Uh - huh .\nphd i: So ,\nphd g: Is there less training data ?\nphd i: uh {disfmarker}\nphd g: I mean , we don\nphd i: No , actually there 's more training data .\nphd g: This is on just digits ?\nprofessor d: No .\nphd i: No , no .\ngrad f: No .\nphd b: Hub - five .\ngrad f: It 's , uh , Swi\nphd g: Oh , sorry . OK . This is on {disfmarker}\nphd i: This is Hub - five .\nphd g: Oh , OK .\ngrad f: Hub - five . Yeah .\nphd i: Yeah . Um , and the test data is CallHome and Switchboard . So , uh {disfmarker} so then {pause} um {disfmarker} Oh , and plus the {disfmarker} the vocal tract {pause} length normalization didn't {disfmarker} actually made things worse . So something 's really seriously wrong . So {disfmarker} Um {disfmarker}\nprofessor d: Aha ! OK .\nphd i: So {disfmarker} So {disfmarker}\nprofessor d: So {disfmarker} but you see , now , between {disfmarker} between the males and the females , there 's certainly a much bigger difference in the scaling range , than there is , say , just within the males . And what you were using before was scaling factors that were just from the {disfmarker} the m the {pause} SRI front - end . And that worked {disfmarker} that worked fine .\nphd i: That 's true . Yeah .\nprofessor d: Uh , but now you 're looking over a larger range and it may not be so fine .\nphd i: Well , um {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} I just {disfmarker} d so the one thing that I then tried was to put in the low - pass filter , which we have in the {disfmarker} So , most {disfmarker} most Hub - five systems actually band - limit the {disfmarker} uh , at about , uh , thirty - seven hundred , um , hertz .\nprofessor d: Uh - huh .\nphd i: Although , you know , normally , I mean , the channel goes to four {disfmarker} four thousand . Right ? So , um {disfmarker} And that actually helped , uh {disfmarker} uh , a little bit .\nprofessor d: Uh - huh .\nphd i: Um {pause} and it didn't hurt on the males either . So , um {disfmarker} And I 'm now , uh , trying the {disfmarker} Oh , and suddenly , also the v the vocal tract length normalization only in the test se on the test data . So , you can do vocal tract length normalization on the test data only or on both the training and the test .\nprofessor d: Yeah .\nphd i: And you expect it to help a little bit if you do it only on the test , and s more if you do it on both training and test .\nprofessor d: Yeah .\nphd i: And so the {disfmarker} It now helps , if you do it only on the test , and I 'm currently retraining another set of models where it 's both in the training and the test , and then we 'll {disfmarker} we 'll have , hopefully , even better results . So {disfmarker} But there 's {disfmarker} It looks like there will still be some difference , maybe between one and two percent , um , for the females .\nprofessor d: Huh .\nphd i: And so , um , you know , I 'm open to suggestions .\ngrad f: Mm - hmm .\nphd i: And it is true that the , uh {disfmarker} that the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you know , we are using the {disfmarker} But {disfmarker} it can't be just the VTL ,\nprofessor d: Uh - huh .\nphd i: because if you don't do VTL in both systems , uh , you know , the {disfmarker} the females are considerably worse in the {disfmarker} with the PLP features .\nprofessor d: No {disfmarker} no . I {disfmarker} I remember that .\ngrad f: It 's much worse . Yeah .\nphd i: So there must be some {disfmarker} something else going on .\nphd g: Well , what 's the standard {disfmarker} ? Yeah , so I thought the performance was actually a little better on females than males .\ngrad f: That 's what I thought , too .\nphd i: Um , {pause} that {pause} ye {comment} overall , yes , but on this particular development test set , they 're actually a little worse . But that 's beside the point . We 're looking at the discrepancy between the SRI system and the SRI system when trained with ICSI features .\nphd g: Right . I 'm just wondering if that {disfmarker} if {disfmarker} if you have any indication of your standard features ,\ngrad f: What 's {disfmarker} Are the freq ?\nphd g: you know , if that 's also different {pause} or in the same direction or not .\nprofessor d: You 're {disfmarker} This is {disfmarker} lemme ask a q more basic que\nphd g: Cuz {disfmarker}\nprofessor d: I mean , is this , uh {disfmarker} uh , iterative , Baum - Welch training ?\nphd i: Mm - hmm .\nprofessor d: Or is it Viterbi training ? Or {disfmarker} ?\nphd i: It 's Baum - Welch training .\nprofessor d: Baum - Welch training . And how do you determine when to {disfmarker} to stop iterating ?\nphd i: Um {disfmarker} Well , actually , we {disfmarker} we just basically do a s a fixed number of iterations .\ngrad f: Hmm .\nphd i: Uh , in this case four . Um , which {disfmarker} Eh , we used to do only three , and then we found out we can squeeze {disfmarker} And it was basically , we 're s we 're keeping it on the safe side . But you 're d Right . It might be that one more iteration {vocalsound} would {disfmarker} would help , but it 's sort of\nprofessor d: Or maybe {disfmarker} or maybe you 're doing one too many .\nphd i: you know .\nprofessor d: I mean it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker}\nphd i: No , but with Baum - Welch , there shouldn't be an over - fitting issue , really .\nprofessor d: Uh . {comment} Well , there can be . Sure .\ngrad f: Well , you can try each one on a cross - validation set ,\nphd i: Um .\nprofessor d: It d if you {disfmarker} if you remember some years ago Bill Byrne did a thing where he was {disfmarker} he was looking at that ,\ngrad f: can't you ?\nprofessor d: and he showed that you could get it .\nphd i: Yeah .\nprofessor d: So . But {disfmarker} {comment} but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} but , um {disfmarker}\nphd i: Well , yeah . We can {disfmarker} Well , that 's {disfmarker} that 's the easy one to check ,\nprofessor d: Yeah .\nphd i: because we save all the intermediate models\ngrad f: Do you {disfmarker} ?\nphd i: and we can {disfmarker}\nprofessor d: And in each case , ho\ngrad f: What {disfmarker} ?\nprofessor d: um , I 'm sorry {disfmarker} in each case how do you determine , you know , the {disfmarker} the usual {pause} fudge factors ? The , uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the , uh , language , uh , scaling , acoustic scaling , uh , uh {disfmarker}\nphd i: Um {pause} I uh {disfmarker} {comment} I 'm actually re - optimizing them . Although that hasn't shown to make {pause} a big difference .\nprofessor d: OK . And the pru the question he was asking at one point about pruning , uh {disfmarker} Remember that one ?\nphd i: Pruning {disfmarker} ?\nprofessor d: Well , he was {disfmarker} he 's {disfmarker} it looked like the probabil at one point he was looking at the probabilities he was getting out {disfmarker} at the likelihoods he was getting out of PLP versus mel cepstrum , and they looked pretty different ,\nphd i: Pruning in the {disfmarker} ?\nphd b: Yeah , the likelihoods were {pause} lower for the PLP .\nprofessor d: as I recall .\nphd g: Oh .\nprofessor d: And so , uh , there 's the question {disfmarker}\nphd i: I you mean {disfmarker} did you see this in the SRI system ?\nphd b: Mm - hmm . Was just looking through the log files ,\nphd i: Um . Well , the likelihoods are {disfmarker}\nphd b: and {disfmarker}\nphd i: You can't directly compare them , because , for every set of models you compute a new normalization . And so these log probabilities , they aren't directly comparable\nphd b: Oh .\nphd i: because you have a different normalization constants for each model you train .\nphd b: Hmm .\nprofessor d: But , still it 's a question {disfmarker}\nphd i: So {disfmarker}\nprofessor d: if you have some threshold somewhere in terms of beam search or something ,\nphd b: Well , yeah . That 's what I was wondering .\nprofessor d: or {disfmarker} ?\nphd i: W yeah . I mean {disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker}\nphd b: I mean , if you have one threshold that works well because the range of your likelihoods is in this area {disfmarker}\nphd i: We prune very conservatively . I mean , as we saw with the meeting data , um {pause} we could probably tighten the pruning without really {disfmarker} So we we basically we have a very open beam .\nprofessor d: But , you 're only talking about a percent or two .\nphd b: Yeah .\nprofessor d: Right ? Here we 're - we 're saying that we there {disfmarker} gee , there 's this b eh , there 's this difference here . And {pause} it {disfmarker} See cuz , i i {comment} there could be lots of things . Right ? But {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but , um , let 's suppose just for a second that , uh , we 've sort of taken out a lot of the {disfmarker} the major differences , uh , between the two .\nphd i: Right . Course . Mm - hmm . Right .\nprofessor d: I mean , we 're already sort of using the mel scale and we 're using the same style filter integration , and {vocalsound} and , well , we 're making sure that low and high {disfmarker}\nphd i: Actually , there is {disfmarker} the difference in that . So , for the PLP features we use the triangular filter shapes . And for the {disfmarker} in the SRI front - end we use the trapezoidal one .\ngrad f: And what 's the top frequency of each ?\nphd i: Well , now it 's the same . It 's thirty {disfmarker} thirty to seven hundred and sixty hertz .\ngrad f: Yeah . Exp - one 's triangular , one 's trapezoidal . So {disfmarker}\nphd i: No , no . But {disfmarker}\nprofessor d: Before we {disfmarker} i i th with straight PLP , it 's trapezoidal also .\nphd i: Well {disfmarker} But {disfmarker}\nprofessor d: But then we had a slight difference in the {disfmarker} in the scale . Uh , so .\nphd i: Since currently the Feacalc program doesn't allow me to change {pause} the filter shape independently of the scale .\ngrad f: Uh - huh .\nphd i: And , I did the experiment on the SRI front - end where I tried the {disfmarker} y where the standard used to be to use trapezoidal filters . You can actually continuously vary it between the two . And so I wen I swi I tried the trap eh , triangular ones . And it did slightly worse , but it 's really a small difference .\ngrad f: Hmm .\nprofessor d: Coup - Couple tenths of a percent or something .\nphd i: So {disfmarker}\ngrad f: OK .\nprofessor d: Right .\ngrad f: So it 's not just losing some {vocalsound} frequency range .\nphd i: Yeah , exactly . So , it 's not {disfmarker} I don't think the filter shape by itself will make a huge {comment} difference .\nprofessor d: Yeah . Right . So the oth {vocalsound} the other thing that {disfmarker}\ngrad f: Yeah .\nprofessor d: So , f i We 've always viewed it , anyway , as the major difference between the two , is actually in the smoothing , that the {disfmarker} that the , um , {vocalsound} PLP , and {disfmarker} and the reason PLP has been advantageous in , uh , slightly noisy situations is because , {vocalsound} PLP does the smoothing at the end by an auto - regressive model ,\nphd i: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\nprofessor d: and mel cepstrum does it by just computing the lower cepstral coefficients .\nphd i: Mm - hmm .\nprofessor d: Um . So , um {disfmarker} Mm - hmm .\nphd i: OK . So {pause} one thing I haven't done yet is to actually do all of this with a much larger {disfmarker} with our full training set . So right now , we 're using a {disfmarker} I don't know , forty ? I i it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} eh {comment} it 's a f training set that 's about , um , you know , by a factor of four smaller than what we use when we train the full system . So , some of these smoothing issues are over - fitting for that matter .\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm .\nphd i: And the Baum - Welch should be much less of a factor , if you go full {disfmarker} whole hog .\nprofessor d: Could be . Yeah .\nphd i: And so , w so , just um {disfmarker} so the strategy is to first sort of treat things {pause} with fast turn - around on a smaller training set and then , {vocalsound} when you 've sort of , narrowed it down , you try it on a larger training set .\nprofessor d: Yeah .\nphd i: And so , we haven't done that yet .\nprofessor d: Now the other que related question , though , is {disfmarker} is , {vocalsound} uh , what 's the boot models for these things ?\nphd i: Th - th the boot models are trained from scratch . So we compute , um {disfmarker} So , we start with a , um , alil alignment that we computed with the b sort of the best system we have . And {disfmarker} and then we train from scratch . So we com we do a , you know , w um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} We collect the {disfmarker} uh , the observations from those alignments under each of the feature sets that {disfmarker} that we {pause} train . And then , from there we do , um {disfmarker} There 's a lot of , actually {disfmarker} {vocalsound} The way it works , you first train a phonetically - tied mixture model . Um . You do a total of {disfmarker} First you do a context - independent PTM model . Then you switch to a context {disfmarker} You do two iterations of that . Then you do two iterations of {disfmarker} of {disfmarker} of context - dependent phonetically - tied mixtures . And then from that you {disfmarker} you do the {disfmarker} you {disfmarker} you go to a state - clustered model ,\nprofessor d: Yeah .\nphd i: and you do four iterations of that . So there 's a lot of iterations overall between your original boot models and the final models . I don't think that {disfmarker} Hmm . We have never seen big differences . Once I thought \" oh , I can {disfmarker} Now I have these much better models . I 'll re - generate my initial alignments . Then I 'll get much better models at the end . \" Made no difference whatsoever . It 's {disfmarker} I think it 's {disfmarker} eh , i\nprofessor d: Right . Well , mis for making things better .\nphd i: the boot models are recur\nprofessor d: Yeah . But , this for making things worse . This it migh Th - the thought is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} is possible {disfmarker} another possible {pause} partial cause is if the boot models {vocalsound} used a comple used a different feature set , that {disfmarker}\nphd i: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . But there are no boot models , in fact . You {disfmarker} you 're not booting from initial models . You 're booting from initial alignments .\nprofessor d: Which you got from a different feature set .\nphd i: That 's correct .\nprofessor d: So , those features look at the data differently , actually .\nphd i: Yeah , but {disfmarker}\nprofessor d: I mean , you know , they {disfmarker} they will find boundaries a little differently , though {disfmarker} You know , all th all that sort of thing is actually slightly different . I 'd expect it to be a minor effect ,\nphd i: But {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but , what I 'm {disfmarker} what I 'm saying is {disfmarker}\nprofessor d: but {disfmarker}\nphd i: So , we e w f w For a long time we had used boot alignments that had been trained with a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} with the same front - end but with acoustic models that were , like , fifteen percent worse than what we use now .\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm .\nphd i: And with a dict different dictionary {disfmarker} with a considerably different dictionary , which was much less detailed and much less well - suited .\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm . Yeah .\nphd i: And so , {vocalsound} then we switched to new boot alignments , which {disfmarker} which now had the benefit of all these improvements that we 've made over two years in the system .\nprofessor d: Right .\nphd i: And , the result in the end was no different .\nprofessor d: Right .\nphd i: So , what I 'm saying is , the exact nature of these boot alignments is probably not {pause} a big factor in the quality of the final models .\nprofessor d: Yeah , maybe not . But {pause} it {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} I st still see it as {disfmarker} I mean , {vocalsound} there 's {disfmarker} there 's a history to this , too ,\nphd i: Yeah .\nprofessor d: but I {disfmarker} uh , I don't wanna go into ,\nphd i: Mm - hmm .\nprofessor d: but {disfmarker} but I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I th I think it could be the things {pause} that it {disfmarker} the data is being viewed in a certain way , uh , that a beginning is here rather than there and so forth ,\nphd i: Yeah . Right .\nprofessor d: because the actual signal - processing you 're doing is slightly different .\nphd i: Right .\nprofessor d: But , {vocalsound} it 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} that 's probably not it .\nphd i: Yeah . Anyway , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I should really reserve , uh , any conclusions until we 've done it on the large training set , um , and until we 've seen the results with the {disfmarker} with the VTL in training .\nprofessor d: Yeah . At some point you also might wanna take the same thing and try it on , uh , some Broadcast News data or something else that actually has {disfmarker} has some noisy {disfmarker} {vocalsound} noisy components , so we can see if any conclusions we come to holds {vocalsound} across {pause} different data .\nphd i: So . Yeah . Right .\nprofessor d: Uh {disfmarker}\nphd i: And , uh , with this , I have to leave .\nprofessor d: OK .\ngrad h: Hmm !\nprofessor d: So , is there something quick about Absinthe {pause} that you {disfmarker} ?\nphd i: With this said .\ngrad f: Uh . Just what we were talking about before , which is that I ported a Blass library to Absinthe , and then got {disfmarker} got it working with fast - forward , and got {vocalsound} {vocalsound} a speedup roughly proportional to the number of processors times the clock cycle .\nphd i: Oh .\ngrad f: So , that 's pretty good .\nphd i: Oh ! Cool .\ngrad f: Um , I 'm in the process of doing it for Quicknet , but there 's something going wrong and it 's about half the speed that I was estimating it should be , and I 'm not sure why .\nphd i: Mm - hmm .\ngrad f: But I 'll keep working on it . But the {disfmarker} what it means is that it 's likely that for net training and forward passes , we 'll {disfmarker} Absinthe will be a good machine . Especially if we get a few more processors and upgrade the processors .\nphd i: A few more processors ? How many are you shooting for ?\ngrad f: There 're five now . It can hold eight .\nphd i: Oh , OK .\nprofessor d: Yeah , we 'll just go buy them , I guess .\ngrad f: And it 's also five - fifty megahertz and you can get a gigahertz .\nphd i: Yeah .\ngrad f: So .\nphd i: Can you mix {pause} t uh , processors of different speed ?\ngrad f: I don't think so . I think we 'd have to do all {disfmarker}\nphd i: OK .\nprofessor d: Probably just throw away the old ones , and {disfmarker}\ngrad f: Yep .\nprofessor d: Thank you {pause} for the box ,\nphd i: Oh , OK .\nprofessor d: and {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I 'll just go buy their process .\ngrad h: Hmm !\nphd i: Maybe we can stick them in another system . I dunno .\ngrad f: We 'd have to get a {disfmarker} almost certainly have to get a , uh , Netfinity server .\nphd i: I see .\ngrad f: They 're pretty {disfmarker} pretty specialized .\nprofessor d: Yeah . OK .\nphd i: OK ."}]}
