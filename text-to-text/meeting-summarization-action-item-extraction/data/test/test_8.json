My name is uh Danny Wolfs . {vocalsound} Uh this is the agenda for today . Uh first a little opening . Uh I will introduce myself , uh and uh I think it's very uh good to introduce uh yourself . Uh then uh a little bit of acquaintance , acquaintance to uh to to ourselves . So uh we get to know each other . Uh that will be done uh with a tool training from the he these two uh smart boards . Then the project plan . What we're going to do , and how we're going to do it . Uh and discussion about that and a little closing at the end . {vocalsound} Okay uh , my name is uh Danny Wolfs . I'm the Project Manager . What's your name ?\nuser interface: I'm Juergen Toffs . I'm the User Interface Designer .\nproject manager: User interface , okay .\nindustrial designer: Hi , my name's uh {gap} . I'm the Industrial Designer .\nproject manager: Industrial , yes .\nmarketing: I'm uh Tim {gap} . Um my function is the Marketing Expert .\nproject manager: Okay , thank you . First a little about the project aim . Uh the the the aim is to make a new remote control . Uh maybe you have read uh read the website . It's a very uh , yeah , very uh ambitious uh company . They uh they wanna do something else . I w Uh there must be a new remote control . Uh first of all uh it must be original , uh and trendy . That's two things really uh close to each other . But at the same time uh user-friendly . And they have uh {disfmarker} Yeah , that's uh very important uh for them . Uh there are three stages . There is a functional design . So uh what are we going uh to uh to do ? What are we going to uh uh make f uh kind of functions in the remote ? And why are we going to do it ? Then the conceptual design . How are going to do it ? {vocalsound} And that's uh really global . Uh because at the detailed design , how , part two , uh we go uh to dig in uh really about how the the te the technical of {disfmarker} If it's uh it's possible technical-wise .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Uh each stage is uh {vocalsound} uh is broken up in two uh two stages , individual work and a meeting . So it's uh it's very straightforward . {vocalsound} Okay , the tool training . We have two smart boards . {vocalsound} This one is for the presentations , the PowerPoint presentations or the Word presentation of whatever you uh you had . Uh and this is uh only for uh drawing . So uh we uh must let it uh stand on this uh this programme . {vocalsound} This is called a smart board\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Speaks for itself .\nproject manager: thing uh {disfmarker} Yeah , it speaks for itself . Um and as you uh may have heard , the documents in the shared folder uh can be uh showed on this screen . Not in y the the My Documents . So if you wanna show something , put it in the shared folder . {vocalsound} Uh {disfmarker} This uh is {gap} very straightforward , with the save , the print , the undo , the blank , the select , the pen . Well , I don't uh gonna explain it all ,\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: because I think you know uh how it works . Um we must not forget uh everything we draw on here , uh all must be saved . We we may not delete anything . So uh if you have uh drawn something , save it . Never delete it . That's a very important uh thing .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay . Uh little uh little {vocalsound} kinda exercise to uh know each other .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound} At uh the white board on the left . Every uh every one of us uh must draw our favourite animal ,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound} and uh tell uh tell us why we uh had uh chosen that animal . Uh important is that we use different colours , {vocalsound} and uh different pen widths . Widths . Widths .\nmarketing: I have a question .\nproject manager: Yes ?\nmarketing: Um this exercise , um did the company board tell you to do it ,\nproject manager: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: or uh did you just make it up yourself ?\nproject manager: No no no . It's uh it's uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker} I I I must do it .\nmarketing: It's part of the introduction ,\nproject manager: Yeah , yeah , yeah . 'Cause we uh really don't know each other ,\nmarketing: okay .\nproject manager: and uh it's kinda new . So getting used to each other , we can uh have a little fun then , before we uh dig in really to the hard stuff .\nmarketing: Okay . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: That kind of thing . Would you start with drawing your uh favourite animal ?\nmarketing: Um , yeah . I don't know really how it works . But maybe you can show us first ?\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Okay , okay . Yeah , okay . Drawing goes with uh this thing . Do not touch your hand on uh this little uh thingy here . That's uh important .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So hold it uh like this .\nuser interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nmarketing: You g you get electrocuted or {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Yeah , kinda . {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So , {vocalsound} um {disfmarker} You must p p uh push a little uh {disfmarker} Good . Because {disfmarker} And uh wait uh wait a few seconds . It's not uh fully real-time , so uh watch it .\nuser interface: Ach . {gap}\nproject manager: Oh yeah . Well I'm gonna paint in the red .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Oh .\nuser interface: Ooph .\nproject manager: That's the background colour . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Well , undo . Um {disfmarker} The pen ? No . One minute please . {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah , that's the one . Well , five . Okay . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound} My favourite animal huh ?\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: It's like Pictionary ? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah , you can guess what it is .\nmarketing: The the one who says it first {vocalsound} gets a raise .\nproject manager: {vocalsound} May uh paint uh next .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: It's a pork ? {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound} No , it's not an orc . {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: You don't see it uh at the ears ?\nmarketing: Mm yeah , I have it at home . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: You have an orc at home ?\nuser interface: Very artistic .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Thank you .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So it's a cat . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: What's it called ?\nproject manager: Simba . 'Cause uh we have a cat at home\nmarketing: Ah .\nproject manager: and he's called Simba . 'Cause he looks like the uh the the lion from The Lion King .\nuser interface: Okay . {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Miniature size ?\nproject manager: So we uh found it kinda cool to uh name it after a lion .\nmarketing: Okay . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: He's happy with us , so uh he's smiling .\nuser interface: Wow . He does have body uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Huh .\nproject manager: No , only the face . Because we have we have twen twenty five minutes . So we uh {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Okay . We have to speed up .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nmarketing: Remember you use uh different colours , and different pen widths .\nproject manager: Yeah . Okay , who wants to go next ?\nmarketing: I {disfmarker} Okay .\nproject manager: Yeah ?\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So choose a colour , choose a pen width and draw a {disfmarker}\nuser interface: You don't have to change the colour and the pen width during uh the drawing .\nmarketing: Save it .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nuser interface: Or {disfmarker}\nmarketing: You have to save it .\nproject manager: Save it , okay .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I've done it . New ? 'Kay .\nuser interface: You have to draw uh push hard on the pen or uh {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Mm uh {disfmarker} Not really .\nproject manager: Kind of firm touch .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: That one .\nuser interface: Oh . Uh hmm .\nmarketing: Yeah ? Okay . Open . Which one is it ? Smart board ?\nproject manager: Yeah .\nuser interface: Okay .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Okay . And now ? Okay . Okay , thanks . 'Kay , I've speed up . 'Kay , that's fine . Line width .\nindustrial designer: By the way , why was your cat uh red ?\nproject manager: Because uh my cat is red uh at home .\nuser interface: Oh .\nindustrial designer: Oh , okay . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: And I have red hair , so uh must be red .\nuser interface: It's a very bloody cat .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} Oh , yeah , sure .\nuser interface: It's a frog . {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: No , it's a turtle . {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound} Uh it's an apple . {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound} It's not an apple .\nindustrial designer: Must be a dog . {vocalsound}\nuser interface: A dog ? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nmarketing: Hmm . Colour . {vocalsound} Something like this . Smaller .\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Huh ?\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Oh , it is a turtle .\nproject manager: It is a turtle . Why a turtle ? Why ? Tim ?\nmarketing: Um {disfmarker} 'Cause I liked Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles .\nproject manager: {vocalsound} You watched it a lot ?\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Uh ?\nproject manager: You watched it a lot ?\nuser interface: It's uh inside its shell . You'll be uh finished sooner .\nmarketing: No , it's uh {disfmarker}\nproject manager: It's a scared turtle .\nmarketing: No no . {vocalsound} It's coming up . Mm . Uh .\nuser interface: Wow .\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Okay , Tim . Thank you . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Something like this . {vocalsound} Okay , you know {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Very artistic .\nproject manager: Jurgen , you want to go next ?\nuser interface: Yes {gap} . Okay . Wha Thank you .\nmarketing: Yeah ? Here you go .\nuser interface: Yeah . Um {disfmarker}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: How did it work ?\nproject manager: Format ? And then you have the the current colour ,\nuser interface: Performance ?\nproject manager: you can change . So no red or green .\nuser interface: And a pen ?\nproject manager: And uh line uh width . I had five .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Tim had {disfmarker} Uh Tim , what kinda line width did you have ?\nuser interface: Um {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Uh the big lines were like nine .\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay . It's a dog .\nuser interface: Well , very good . {vocalsound} I just uh thought I'd pick the easiest one .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} Uh .\nproject manager: Okay . Why a dog ? You have a dog at home ?\nuser interface: Well , we had a dog , a few years ago .\nproject manager: Had a dog ?\nmarketing: Uh , it's p\nproject manager: Yeah ?\nuser interface: And and it , {gap} yeah , when it died we didn't get a new one or something .\nproject manager: Ah .\nuser interface: But uh {disfmarker}\nmarketing: It's pretty good uh {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: You have an artistic uh inner middle .\nmarketing: {gap} {vocalsound} An artist .\nproject manager: {gap} {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Uh a Graphical User Designer , so {disfmarker}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Hmm .\nuser interface: Hey .\nmarketing: Think you uh picked the wrong uh function . Wrong job .\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound} Oh .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: No . Can work together . Ah colour .\nproject manager: So I think you can see it's real uh really a easy programme to use . Not difficult at all .\nmarketing: Wha\nuser interface: {vocalsound} Well ,\nproject manager: Okay ,\nuser interface: it's okay {gap} .\nproject manager: thank you . {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound} That's enough ,\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: thanks . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Janus ? The last one ?\nindustrial designer: Yeah , sure .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Uh thanks .\nmarketing: I wonder .\nproject manager: Yeah . After a cat , a turtle and a dog .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I think he's gonna draw an elephant . {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I figure I should do something like that ,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: but I'm gonna do something much more difficult .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Uh-oh .\nuser interface: Uh-oh . Oh , he is the artistic {gap} design .\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I'm gonna design a remote uh {vocalsound} remote control animal . {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound} Remote control animal .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} Exactly . Uh {disfmarker}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Oh . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Sorry .\nuser interface: Well with the interface , it might be easier to ha to draw here and display there uh .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: {gap}\nmarketing: That that might be easier . But at the other hand , uh a pen like that is easy to hold in your hand , and {disfmarker}\nproject manager: No .\nmarketing: I think it's easier to draw .\nproject manager: Better to draw with a with {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Yeah . With a pen than with a mouse mouse .\nuser interface: Than on the , with {disfmarker}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah , I m I mean like uh like on here , drawing drawing uh . And then displaying on screen , but {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Mouth . Oh , okay . Yeah . W with this paper it's too mu too expensive . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: But what is he uh ?\nuser interface: Too expensive , yeah .\nproject manager: Is it a rabbit ?\nindustrial designer: Yes . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Do you have a rabbit at home ?\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: No .\nmarketing: It's a rabbit with uh broken legs ? {vocalsound}\nuser interface: A green rabbit .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} No . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Is it a white rabbit f It's the white rabbit from The Matrix .\nindustrial designer: Yeah , exactly . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay , then yeah .\nuser interface: There , the g white green rabbit .\nindustrial designer: So .\nuser interface: {vocalsound} He's a little bit stoned there . {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Uh I figured this is a pretty b good impression of a rabbit .\nmarketing: Yeah . It will do .\nindustrial designer: Uh uh {disfmarker} Uh well .\nproject manager: Okay . Finishing touch and then we're going further .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Project Manager ? Uh {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Yeah ?\nindustrial designer: Where does the pen go ? Just uh {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Have you been uh counting the time ?\nproject manager: Yeah , a little . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Okay . Let's go on then .\nproject manager: Well , I think the dog is the the most uh artistic .\nindustrial designer: Uh I figured the rabbit was actually the most uh impressive . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Don't choose for youself .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} Oh , sorry . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: That's selfish . Okay , now we're gonna dig into the to the serious stuff ."}, {"chapter": 2, "start_ms": 1830000, "topic": "Financial targets of the new remote control project", "transcript_text": "project manager: {vocalsound} Uh the selling price for the remote will be uh twenty five Euro , and the production cost uh may not be more than uh twenty and a half Euro . So uh from my point of view , I don't think it's uh gonna be very uh very high tech , high definition , uh ultra modern uh kinda remote , for twelve uh fift uh twelve and a half Euro .\nmarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Uh the profit we must make with uh the new remote is uh fifty million Euro . So that's a lot . We have to sell uh a lot of uh {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Yeah , how much is it ?\nmarketing: Like how much ?\nuser interface: Hundred million uh remotes or something ?\nproject manager: Uh I think uh w when the selling price is twenty five , uh uh you got two million , two million remotes .\nuser interface: Oh yeah .\nindustrial designer: Twenty million . Two million , oh yeah , two million . Yeah .\nproject manager: But our marketing range is uh , market range is international . So we have uh virtually the whole world we can sell uh we can sell our r remotes to . At least that uh countries which have uh a television ."}, {"chapter": 3, "start_ms": 1896000, "topic": "New useful features of the new remote control", "transcript_text": "project manager: Um {disfmarker} So now it's time uh for us to uh going uh to discuss a little uh things . You can think about uh experience with a remote control uh yourself , at home . What you think might be uh a useful uh new feature . What uh what can distinguish our new trendy remote control from all the others . Um so uh let's uh let's uh discuss a little . I'm gonna join you at the table . {vocalsound} Well what what's the most uh important thing at a remote control ?\nuser interface: Um well I think the most important thing of a remote control is that you can switch channels . And my opinion is you should keep it as basic as possible . Uh {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Okay . So not a not a remote control who uh uh which can uh can be used for television and a D_V_D_ and radio and {disfmarker} Or just only {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Yeah . I think so . Uh but I have some points . Can I show them on the on the big screen ? Maybe ?\nproject manager: If you have them on uh {disfmarker} I can uh {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Yeah . Yeah , I can find {disfmarker} Uh .\nproject manager: Okay . Oh , in case you want it {disfmarker} This is a dead kind of fly . Between the the the , yeah , the the uh {disfmarker}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Screen ?\nproject manager: Yeah , be The screens .\nmarketing: Okay .\nuser interface: Is it possible to open pen drawings in this uh on this screen ?\nproject manager: {vocalsound} No no no . Only {disfmarker} All the drawings go there , at the left uh {disfmarker} {gap}\nuser interface: Uh but um which {disfmarker} The ones we made on the {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Oh , that pen drawings . Uh no , I think uh when it is uh in Word and you have saved it in the Shared Documents folder , you can show it there .\nuser interface: Oh , only in Word ,\nproject manager: Yeah .\nuser interface: okay .\nmarketing: Okay , I have some uh points from marketing point of view .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nmarketing: Um just the standard thing li things like uh intuitive , uh small , fairly cheap . Uh it's pretty cheap , twenty five Euros . Uh brand independent . Um I think , it doesn't have to matter uh which brand your T_V_ or other thing is . Um {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Yeah . Okay . Five minutes .\nmarketing: Five minutes ?\nproject manager: Yeah .\nmarketing: Okay , I'll wrap it up quickly . Um I personally think it has to be multi-purpose .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nmarketing: Uh most of the remote c uh remote controls are uh just for one purpose .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nmarketing: And uh by making it multi-purpose , it uh has a new feature , adds a new feature to the market , and distinguish from uh from current products .\nproject manager: Mm-hmm .\nmarketing: Um maybe some other technology than infrared . Uh I rather find it very annoying um , like when someone is standing in front of the T_V_ then you can't switch it . Um {vocalsound} think about um sending it over radio waves or bluetooth .\nproject manager: Okay . Okay .\nmarketing: That might be a little bit uh expensive . Um {disfmarker} And something like an L_C_D_ screen .\nuser interface: For what purpose ?\nmarketing: Um uh like I said here um {disfmarker} Maybe it's easy . It's nice as an added feature feature , that um , {vocalsound} when you're on a certain channel , you can see on the L_C_D_ screen uh what programmes are coming up or {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Okay . So it be uh a multi-purpose uh very technically uh high uh\nmarketing: From my point of view , yeah .\nproject manager: remote ? Yeah , it must be really uh innovative , technical-wise ?\nmarketing: Yeah , it has to be uh {disfmarker} Yeah , our company is very uh good in making new innovative uh things .\nproject manager: Yeah . So yeah , I I agree with you .\nuser interface: {vocalsound} We {disfmarker}\nmarketing: So i i i i\nproject manager: So we must focus on things who are really uh really add something to uh to {disfmarker}\nmarketing: To the current market .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nmarketing: Look , {vocalsound} you got some cheap uh remote controls there . They just uh {disfmarker} Yeah , you got a dozen of 'em .\nproject manager: No .\nmarketing: But when you enter a new market with a remote control and\nproject manager: Mm-hmm .\nmarketing: uh wanna gain market share\nproject manager: Yeah .\nmarketing: you have to do something special , I think .\nproject manager: Yeah . But we have to keep an eye that it's {disfmarker} Uh at the beginning of such a project , it's it's it's very uh cool to talk about , well , this would be cool , that would be cool .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Uh but we must not uh lose uh sight of the the user uh uh friendly uh {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Yeah , of course .\nuser interface: And and the price . {gap}\nmarketing: But it's {disfmarker} But but this is just from marketing uh aspect ."}, {"chapter": 4, "start_ms": 2286000, "topic": "General plan of the next meeting about the user requirements and technical functions", "transcript_text": "project manager: Okay , uh next meeting will start in thirty minutes . So uh you uh will have uh individual actions where I presume uh will be some feedback , uh via the m the mail . Um {vocalsound} the the the Industrial uh Designer has to uh look at the working design . {vocalsound} Uh the User Interface Designer has to look at the technical functions . So that's the thing we uh discussed .\nuser interface: Yeah . Um one thing uh ,\nproject manager: Yeah ?\nuser interface: we must first agree on uh what we're going to m going to make . Do we {disfmarker} Are we going to use um it it for multiple systems ? Or uh {disfmarker} We should have some agreement on that before we {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Okay . Um wha\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Mm uh I I don't think we have to be , we have to agree on that . Uh {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: I figure we could get back to it on the next meeting actually .\nmarketing: I think th that's a pha Yeah .\nuser interface: Okay .\nmarketing: That's a phase further .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nmarketing: Ju just uh make some mock-ups , some some general ideas .\nuser interface: Ah okay .\nmarketing: And and then we can plan {disfmarker} Yeah .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nmarketing: We can plan further , I think .\nproject manager: Yeah . But maybe , because uh you are working on the user requirements , you are working on the technical functions , we uh must uh have a little or kinda uh uh uh {disfmarker} How do you call it ? Uh {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Consensus on the , what we're gonna do .\nproject manager: Uh a little plan on on what we're going to do . So you don't uh uh come up with the user requirements who don't fit the the the the technical functions at all . Some basic things we co we want to going to do . Uh I think that's well uh {disfmarker} Yeah . Will come in handy .\nmarketing: Mm yeah .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nmarketing: I don't know . You decide . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay .\nmarketing: You're the Project Manager .\nproject manager: W {vocalsound} He says {disfmarker}\nuser interface: if the technical functions have to be designed , I I've gotta know for what kind of machines they will be .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nuser interface: Or do we use it a text screen ? Or uh will it be with uh with bluetooth or {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Well , th that's that's really a step further . But if you say uh {vocalsound} is it uh uh one way or multi-purpose , that's a {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Okay . Mm-hmm .\nmarketing: Uh tha that's a same step further .\nproject manager: Why ?\nindustrial designer: Yeah , actually it is .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: Why ?\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} Then looking at individual components ,\nmarketing: Uh .\nindustrial designer: so that's actually a f step further .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nmarketing: Like we all have a list of uh things that has to b that have to be in it , or how it has to be like . And then in the next meeting we decide\nproject manager: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Yeah , we can take it from there .\nmarketing: w what it's gonna be .\nproject manager: Okay .\nindustrial designer: Yeah , I agree uh , we can take it from there .\nmarketing: A And then you s then you can delete uh\nindustrial designer: Or edit .\nmarketing: the o the obsolete uh details .\nproject manager: Okay . So uh\nmarketing: I think .\nproject manager: each individually i individually uh must think on what's uh at uh his point of view is the most important . And uh then we're going to fit uh all the pieces together the next meeting .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: I must finish off now ,\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: so it's over . You uh will receive specific specific instructions uh by your personal coach . And I see you in uh thirty minutes . Thank you ."}]}
