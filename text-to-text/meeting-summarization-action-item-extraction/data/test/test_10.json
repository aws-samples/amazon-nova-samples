Mm mm mm . {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Not too many cables and stuff .\nmarketing: {gap}\nuser interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound} Original . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Is recorded ? Okay ? Okay so welcome everyone . So we are here for the kickoff meeting of uh the process of designing a new remote control . So I will first start with a warm welcome opening {vocalsound} stuff ,\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: then uh we will uh see what will be uh our product and what will be the different step we will have to design it . And uh then we will uh discuss if we have few ideas and we will uh end uh by uh dispatching the different task you will be {disfmarker} you will have to fulfil to complete this process . So {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Uh . Just one thing . Uh , you said twenty-five minutes , but I have something else to do uh , so gotta have another meeting uh soon ,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: so maybe you could hurry up a bit {disfmarker}\nproject manager: {vocalsound} sorry ?\nuser interface: It's true . I have another meeting so if you could uh {disfmarker}\nproject manager: You have another meeting soon ?\nuser interface: Yeah .\nproject manager: So you have to be quick .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah , for the lawnmower project .\nproject manager: Okay .\nuser interface: Okay .\nproject manager: So the the goal is to have a remote control so to have an advantage over our competitors we have to be original , we have to be trendy and we have to also try to be user-friendly .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So uh the design step will be divided in three uh main points . First it will be the functional design . Third is the conceptual design and then is the desired design . So the functional design is to identify the main user needs , the technical function the remote control should fulfil . And then we will move to f conceptual design where we'll specify the different component involved , what kind of user interf interface we want and what are the different uh trend in user interface and stuff like that .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}"}, {"chapter": 2, "start_ms": 168000, "topic": "Drawings of favourite animals", "transcript_text": "project manager: And then the desired devi design will consist in uh specifically implementing {vocalsound} and detailing the choice we've uh made in the second point . So I will now ask you which is very important for the design of a new remote control for to uh each of us to to draw uh your favourite animal on the white board .\nuser interface: {vocalsound} What an original idea .\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Do you have any idea of which animal you want to show us ? {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Orangutan .\nproject manager: Okay {vocalsound} that's good .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: No no n\nproject manager: {vocalsound} n n {gap}\nuser interface: Can I give you the\nproject manager: You should {disfmarker}\nuser interface: {disfmarker} no ? But I don't have to say anything . When I'm drawing the orangutan .\nproject manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} If you want to react uh about this wonderful drawing uh {vocalsound} I'll let you uh comment .\nuser interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: It's an abstract drawing of an orangutan .\nproject manager: Okay it's an abstract drawing .\nuser interface: Yes .\nproject manager: I think it's nice and original . {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} You should write y the name I think . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: I don't have a red colour . Usually orangutans have red hair so this is a very important but I don't have red pen , so {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Okay .\nuser interface: {vocalsound} Yes .\nproject manager: You want to draw something Christine ? {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Okay uh sorry . You have to imagine a little bit {vocalsound} um .\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: This {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Of course your animal is recorded so it's not lost . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Sorry too {vocalsound} uh .\nuser interface: Yes . I know .\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Is this uh {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Wha what is this strange beast ?\nmarketing: Is it beautiful ? {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Is it a monster ?\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Do you know ? It's a cat .\nuser interface: It's a cat ?\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Isn't it ? {vocalsound}\nuser interface: I thought these things did not exist .\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Yes yes\nindustrial designer: Me {vocalsound}\nmarketing: is it {disfmarker} like that .\nuser interface: Ah yeah {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Ah yeah . Yeah .\nmarketing: Is it better ?\nproject manager: Ah okay it's pretty . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Okay .\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Okay it's your cat . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound} It's my cat .\nuser interface: Does have a name ?\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: The name is Caramel .\nuser interface: Caramel . Ah-ha .\nindustrial designer: Caramel .\nmarketing: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay . Olivier , do you want to {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} And you {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I think I'm too short for the cables . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Okay I go , but next time you'll do something I'm sure . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I'm a bit short on cable .\nuser interface: Next time I concentrate .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay . So what could I draw ? {vocalsound} Maybe I can draw like a very simplified cow . {vocalsound} I don't know if it looks like a cow {vocalsound}\nuser interface: He looks like a bong .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Like a what ? {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay . Sorry . No .\nindustrial designer: Quite squarey .\nuser interface: Scary ?\nproject manager: {gap} {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: He also . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I dunno it it looks more like a donkey in fact {vocalsound} I would say .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound} I I think we will be finished this uh {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: Mm .\nproject manager: Okay so I hope that it helps you uh in the process of designing a remote control .\nuser interface: Is it for uh for putting a {disfmarker} for logos , no .\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Okay ."}, {"chapter": 3, "start_ms": 750000, "topic": "Specific designing requirements for the remote control", "transcript_text": "user interface: I is there a matter for a new remote control ?\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Yeah if it's trendy , original I d fulfil the user needs .\nuser interface: Is it uh a single device remote control or is it a multi-device remote control ?\nproject manager: We have to discuss that point .\nuser interface: Ah\nproject manager: On {disfmarker}\nuser interface: this is not defined at all ?\nproject manager: yeah you you can suggest points like this . So what what {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Ah , okay .\nproject manager: so we have to decide for example if it can control one device or multiple . So what's {disfmarker} what are your ideas about that ?\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Maybe I can have the {disfmarker} your opinion from the marketing side ?\nuser interface: Well uh do we sell other stuff ? Uh if if we bundle the remote control with something uh to sell then it could be a single device , otherwise it could be programmable one otherwise who would buy a remote control from us .\nproject manager: Okay , so if it selled uh by its own i it it would rather be for multiple device .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Do you agree ?\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: Yeah . So maybe it should be for multiple devices . And uh do you have any ideas um of uh design ideas or any uh uh technical requirement we we should uh fulfil ?\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} I think we shouldn't have too many b for my part . I think {disfmarker}\nuser interface: No , I couldn I cannot fi think of any requirements right now . {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: If we don't have so many buttons could be nice .\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Few buttons . Okay .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: And do you have it also to be {disfmarker} to be lighted in order to be used in the dark ? Might be a good idea .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nproject manager: Okay . And do you have any um any uh idea of the trend {disfmarker} the trend in domain , what it shouldn't {disfmarker} it should look like , or things like that ?\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} Something which is not squarey maybe uh , not a box .\nuser interface: Mm .\nproject manager: With rou okay . Like for {disfmarker} okay .\nuser interface: Something like that , least fits in your hand .\nproject manager: Okay .\nuser interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nuser interface: The basic requirement .\nproject manager: So . Fit in your hand , yeah .\nuser interface: {vocalsound} Only a buck .\nproject manager: And also it have , i it may be {vocalsound} it may be important for the remote control to be uh {disfmarker} To , to resist to various shocks that can happen if it fall .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm .\nuser interface: Waterproof . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Water-proof as well .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} And I think we should have a device {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Maybe it is original because you can uh use it in your uh {disfmarker} in your bath whereas the others can't .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Maybe water-proof would be very original .\nindustrial designer: Sorry . {gap}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Havin having a water-proof remote control so that the people can uh use it in their bath .\nuser interface: Mm .\nproject manager: That could be uh {disfmarker}\nuser interface: B it seems uh so , but uh if you don't have an waterproof remote control it means you can just cover it with some plastic and you can sort of f\nproject manager: Yeah but , it is still something uh you have to buy and that is um not maybe very {disfmarker}\nuser interface: And , and that's one of the {disfmarker} that's one of the shock {disfmarker} I mean there are people that have a remote control and they are worried that it's going to break and they put some extra plastic around it .\nproject manager: Yeah , mayb B\nuser interface: That's people {gap} they actually do it themselves .\nproject manager: But maybe we can bulk it with uh already this plastic thing and uh the waterproof uh stuff as well .\nindustrial designer: Yeah . {gap} directly .\nuser interface: I it will look a bulky in that case .\nproject manager: Yeah . Maybe we can sell uh all that together , so so plastic protection and uh and a waterproof box as well .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nproject manager: That might be good uh track to follow .\nuser interface: Like as an optional thing .\nproject manager: Optional or selled with it ?\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} And I I think we should have something , most of the time I I lose my remote control .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: We should have s uh special bu button on the T_V_ to make the remote control beeping .\nproject manager: Maybe we can have uh {disfmarker} But we don't design the T_V_ .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Maybe we can have uh something you whistle and uh the remote control uh beep .\nindustrial designer: Ah yeah .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Barks .\nindustrial designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah , barks , yeah .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} Barks .\nproject manager: So we can uh have a whistle uh remote control ?\nindustrial designer: Yeah . Yeah whistle .\nproject manager: I don't know , whistle-able ? {vocalsound} Th\nindustrial designer: Whistle tracking . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Whistle tracking yeah . Whistle tracking remote control . That's a good idea , that's very original and that's can uh improve .\nuser interface: {vocalsound} That's that's quite cool , but uh of course we {disfmarker} you don't normally need uh any audio uh recording stuff on your remote control right ?\nproject manager: Yeah d d uh .\nuser interface: So i it's just going to add t to the cost .\nproject manager: Yeah but s still we have to mm we have to {vocalsound} have an advantage over our competitors . I think this is a good advantage .\nuser interface: {vocalsound} It's cool . I think I like the idea , but I'm not sure about the what you ,\nproject manager: Yeah . We have to ask {disfmarker}\nuser interface: who is giving {disfmarker} who's giving who's giving our budget . Who's {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Yeah . We have to ask the quest of that's uh design to the uh Industrial um Designer .\nuser interface: Yeah . Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} yeah {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Which is you .\nuser interface: 'Kay . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Okay so try to find that for next meeting . {vocalsound}"}]}
