Um so first of all , just to kind of make sure that we all know each other ,\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: I'm Laura and I'm the project manager . {vocalsound} Do you want to introduce yourself again ?\nmarketing: Great .\nindustrial designer: Hi , I'm David and I'm supposed to be an industrial designer .\nproject manager: Okay .\nmarketing: And I'm Andrew and I'm uh our marketing\nuser interface: Um I'm Craig and I'm User Interface .\nmarketing: expert .\nproject manager: Great . Okay . {vocalsound} Um so we're designing a new remote control and um {disfmarker} Oh I have to record who's here actually . So that's David , Andrew and Craig , isn't it ? And you all arrived on time . Um yeah so des uh {vocalsound} design a new remote control . Um , as you can see it's supposed to be original , trendy and user friendly . Um so that's kind of our our brief , as it were . Um and so there are three different stages to the design . Um I'm not really sure what what you guys have already received um in your emails . What did you get ?\nindustrial designer: Um , I just got the project announcement about what the project is {vocalsound} .\nproject manager: Mm-hmm .\nindustrial designer: Designing a remote control .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nindustrial designer: That's about it , didn't get anything else .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm . Yeah , that's that's it .\nproject manager: Is that what everybody got ?\nindustrial designer: Did you get the same thing ?\nuser interface: Yeah .\nproject manager: Okay .\nmarketing: Yeah ."}, {"chapter": 2, "start_ms": 126000, "topic": "Discussion about favourite animal characteristics and the workflow", "transcript_text": "project manager: Um . So we're gonna have like individual work and then a meeting about it . And repeat that process three times . Um and at this point we get try out the whiteboard over there . Um . {vocalsound} So uh you get to draw your favourite animal and sum up your favourite characteristics of it . So who would like to go first ?\nmarketing: I will go . That's fine .\nproject manager: Very good . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Alright . So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} This one here , right ?\nproject manager: Mm-hmm .\nmarketing: Okay . Very nice . Alright . My favourite animal is like {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} A beagle .\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Um charac favourite characteristics of it ? Is that right ?\nproject manager: Yeah . Yeah .\nmarketing: Uh , right , well basically um high priority for any animal for me is that they be willing to take a lot of physical affection from their family . And , yeah that they have lots of personality and uh be fit and in robust good health .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: So this is blue . Blue beagle . My family's beagle .\nproject manager: Right .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Lovely . {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {gap} Well , my favourite animal would be a monkey .\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound} Then they're small cute and furry , and uh when planet of the apes becomes real , {vocalsound} I'm gonna be up there with them .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Cool .\nproject manager: Right .\nuser interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: There's too much gear . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: You can take as long over this as you like , because we haven't got an awful lot to discuss .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Ok oh we do we do\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Don't feel like you're in a rush , anyway .\nindustrial designer: Okay .\nmarketing: I coulda told you a whole lot more about beagles .\nproject manager: Ach {gap} why not {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Boy , let me tell you . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: We might have to get you up again then .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I don't know what mine is . I'm gonna have to think on the spot now .\nmarketing: Impressionist .\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Can't draw . {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Um .\nproject manager: Is that a whale ? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah . Um , well anyway , I don't know , it's just the first animal I can think off the top of my head . Um . Yes . Big reason is 'cause I'm allergic to most animals . Allergic to animal fur ,\nproject manager: Ah .\nindustrial designer: so um fish was a natural choice . Um , yeah , and I kind of like whales . They come in and go {vocalsound} eat everything in sight . {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: And they're quite harmless and mild and interesting .\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Alright . Mm .\nproject manager: Okay . God , I still don't know what I'm gonna write about . Um .\nmarketing: Superb sketch , by the way .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} Tail's a bit big , I think . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I was gonna choose a dog as well .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: But I'll just draw a different kind of dog .\nmarketing: Yep .\nproject manager: M my favourite animal is my own dog at home . {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker} That doesn't really look like him , actually . He looks more like a pig , actually . Ah well .\nmarketing: I see a dog in there .\nproject manager: Do you ?\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Oh that's very good of you .\nmarketing: Yep . {vocalsound} Now I see a rooster .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Uh .\nmarketing: What kind is it ?\nproject manager: Um he's a mixture of uh various things . Um and what do I like about him , um {disfmarker} That's just to suggest that his tail wags .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Um he's very friendly and cheery and always pleased to see you , and very kind of affectionate and um {vocalsound} uh and he's quite quite wee as well so you know he can {disfmarker} doesn't take up too much space .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Um and uh {disfmarker} And he does a funny thing where he chases his tail as well ,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: which is quite amusing , so {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Is he aware that th it's his own cha tail he's chasing ?\nproject manager: It is . I think it is . He only does it after he's had his dinner\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: and um he'll just all of a sudden just get up and start chasing his tail 'round the living room .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} It's an after dinner dog then .\nmarketing: Hmm .\nproject manager: Yeah , so uh {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Probably when he was little he got lots of attention for doing it and has forever been conditioned .\nproject manager: Yeah , maybe . Maybe . {vocalsound} Right , um where did you find this ?\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Just down here ? Yeah .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay . {vocalsound} Um what are we doing next ? Uh um . Okay , uh we now need to discuss the project finance . Um so according to the brief um we're gonna be selling this remote control for twenty five Euro , um and we're aiming to make fifty million Euro . Um so we're gonna be selling this on an international scale . And uh we don't want it to cost any more than uh twelve fifty Euros , so fifty percent of the selling price .\nmarketing: 'Kay . Um , can we just go over that again ?\nproject manager: Sure .\nmarketing: Uh , so bas at twel Alright , yeah . Okay . So cost {disfmarker} like production cost is twelve fifty ,\nproject manager: All together .\nmarketing: but selling price is {disfmarker} is that wholesale or retail ? Like on the shelf .\nproject manager: Um I dunno . I imagine {disfmarker} That's a good question .\nmarketing: Our sale our sale anyway .\nproject manager: I imagine it probably is our sale actually\nmarketing: Yeah , okay okay .\nproject manager: because it's probably up to the the um the retailer to uh sell it for whatever price they want . Um .\nmarketing: Okay . Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: But I {disfmarker} I don't know ,\nmarketing: Alright .\nproject manager: I mean do you think the fact that it's going to be sold internationally will have a bearing on how we design it at all ?\nmarketing: Yes . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Think it will ? Um .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Hmm .\nmarketing: Well right away I'm wondering if there's um th th uh , like with D_V_D_ players , if there are zones .\nproject manager: Oh yeah , regions and stuff , yeah .\nmarketing: Um f frequencies or something\nproject manager: Yeah . Okay .\nmarketing: um as well as uh characters , um different uh keypad styles and s symbols .\nindustrial designer: Hmm .\nproject manager: Yeah . Well for a remote control , do you think that will be {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Um .\nproject manager: I suppose it's depends on how complicated our remote control is .\nmarketing: I don't know . Yeah .\nindustrial designer: It does make sense from maybe the design point of view 'cause you have more complicated characters like European languages , then you need more buttons .\nproject manager: Yeah , yeah .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: So , possibly .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: Okay .\nmarketing: And then a and then al the other thing international is on top of the price . I'm thinking the price might might appeal to a certain market in one region , whereas in another it'll be different , so {disfmarker}\nproject manager: What , just like in terms of like the wealth of the country ?\nmarketing: Just a chara just a characteristic of the {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Like how much money people have to spend on things like ?\nmarketing: Just {disfmarker} Or just like , basic product podi positioning , the twenty five Euro remote control might be a big hit in London , might not be such a big hit in Greece , who knows ,\nproject manager: Aye , I see what you mean , yeah .\nmarketing: something like that , yeah .\nproject manager: Marketing . Good marketing thoughts .\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Yep .\nproject manager: Oh gosh , I should be writing all this down . Um .\nmarketing: Right away I'm making some kind of assumptions about what what information we're given here ,\nproject manager: Mm .\nmarketing: thinking , 'kay trendy probably means something other than just basic ,\nproject manager: Yeah .\nmarketing: something other than just standard . Um so I'm wondering right away , is selling twenty five Euros , is that sort of the {disfmarker} thi is this gonna to be like the premium product kinda thing or {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Yeah , yeah . Like how much does , you know , a remote control cost .\nmarketing: Uh-huh .\nproject manager: Well twenty five Euro , I mean that's um that's about like eighteen pounds or something , isn't it ? Or no , is it as much as that ?\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: Sixteen seventeen eighteen pounds .\nmarketing: Yep . Yeah , I'd say so , yeah .\nproject manager: Um , I dunno , I've never bought a remote control , so I don't know how how good a remote control that would get you . Um .\nmarketing: No . Yeah , yeah . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: But yeah , I suppose it has to look kind of cool and gimmicky .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: Um right , okay . Let me just scoot on ahead here . Okay . Um well d Does anybody have anything to add to uh to the finance issue at all ? Thin\nmarketing: Do we have any other background information on like how that compares to other\nproject manager: No , actually . That would be useful , though ,\nmarketing: other {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nproject manager: wouldn't it , if you knew like what your money would get you now .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Hmm .\nproject manager: Mm-hmm .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm . Yeah , interesting thing about discussing um production of a remote control for me is that l as you point out , I just don't think of remote controls as somethin something people consciously assess in their purchasing habits .\nproject manager: Yeah , yeah .\nmarketing: It's just like getting shoelaces with shoes or something .\nproject manager: Oh . Five minutes to end of meeting .\nmarketing: It just comes along .\nproject manager: Oh , okay . We're a bit behind .\nmarketing: Do you know what I mean ?\nuser interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nmarketing: Like so sort of like how do you I I mean one one way of looking at it would be , well the people producing television sets , maybe they have to buy remote controls . Or another way is maybe people who have T_V_ sets are really fed up with their remote control and they really want a better one or something .\nuser interface: I know um {disfmarker} My parents went out and bought um remote controls because um they got fed up of having four or five different remote controls for each things the house .\nmarketing: But {disfmarker} Right . Right .\nuser interface: So um for them it was just how many devices control .\nmarketing: Okay so {disfmarker} Right , so in function one of the priorities might be to combine as many uses {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Yeah . Right , so do you think that should be like a main design aim of our remote control d you know ,\nmarketing: I think so .\nproject manager: do your your satellite and your regular telly and your V_C_R_ and everything ?\nmarketing: Yeah , yeah . Yeah . Well like um , maybe what we could use is a sort of like a example of a successful other piece technology is palm palm pilots . They're gone from being just like little sort of scribble boards to cameras , M_P_ three players , telephones ,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm .\nmarketing: everything , agenda . So , like , I wonder if we might add something new to the to the remote control market ,\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nmarketing: such as the lighting in your house , or um {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Or even like , you know , notes about um what you wanna watch . Like you might put in there oh I want to watch such and such and look a\nmarketing: Yeah , yeah .\nproject manager: Oh that's a good idea . So extra functionalities .\nmarketing: An Yeah . Like , p personally for me , at home I've I've combined the um the audio video of my television set and my D_V_D_ player and my C_D_ player . So they w all work actually function together but I have different remote controls for each of them .\nproject manager: Mm-hmm .\nmarketing: So it's sort of ironic that that then they're in there um you know , the sound and everything it's just one system .\nproject manager: Hmm .\nmarketing: But each one's got its own little part .\nproject manager: Um okay , uh I'd wel we're gonna have to wrap up pretty quickly in the next couple of minutes . Um I'll just check we've nothing else . Okay . Um so anything else anybody wants to add about what they don't like about remote controls they've used , what they would really like to be part of this new one at all ?\nindustrial designer: And you keep losing them .\nproject manager: You keep losing them .\nmarketing: Mm .\nproject manager: Okay .\nindustrial designer: Finding them is really a pain , you know .\nmarketing: Mm . Mm .\nindustrial designer: I mean it's usually quite small , or when you want it right , it slipped behind the couch\nmarketing: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nindustrial designer: or it's kicked under the table .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: W You get those ones where you can , if you like , whistle or make a really high pitched noise they beep .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: You know .\nmarketing: That's just really good id Yep .\nproject manager: There {disfmarker} I mean is that something we'd want to include , do you think ?\nmarketing: Uh , {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Dunno .\nmarketing: sure . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay maybe . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I remember when the first remote control my my family had was on a cable . Actually had a cable between it and the T_V_\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: and big like buttons that sort of like , like on a blender or something .\nproject manager: My goodness .\nmarketing: And um , you know , when I think about what they are now , it's better , but actually it's still kind of , I dunno , like a massive junky thing on the table .\nproject manager: Still feels quite primitive .\nmarketing: Maybe we could think about how , could be more , you know , streamlined . S\nproject manager: Maybe like a touch screen or something ?\nmarketing: Something like that , yeah .\nproject manager: Okay .\nmarketing: Or whatever would be technologically reasonable .\nproject manager: Uh-huh , okay . Well I guess that's up to our industrial designer .\nmarketing: 'Cause it could b it could it could be that f it could be that functionally that doesn't make it any better , but that just the appeal of of not having {disfmarker}\nproject manager: It looks better .\nmarketing: You know , these days there's a r pe things in people's homes are becoming more and more like chic , you know .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nmarketing: Um , nicer materials\nproject manager: Okay .\nmarketing: and might be\nproject manager: Okay .\nmarketing: be worth exploring anyway .\nuser interface: Uh .\nproject manager: Right , well um so just to wrap up the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes . So that's about um about ten to twelve by my watch . Um so inbetween now and then , um as the industrial designer , you're gonna be working on you know the actual working design of it\nindustrial designer: Yep .\nproject manager: so y you know what you're doing there . Um for user interface , technical functions , I guess that's you know like what we've been talking about , what it'll actually do . Um and uh marketing executive , you'll be just thinking about what it actually {disfmarker} what , you know , what requirements it has to has to fulfil and you'll all get instructions emailed to you , I guess .\nmarketing: Okay .\nproject manager: Um .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah , so it's th the functional design stage is next , I guess . {vocalsound} And uh and that's the end of the meeting . So I got that little message a lot sooner than I thought I would , so {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Um . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Before we wrap up , just to make sure we're all on the same page here ,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm .\nmarketing: um , do we {disfmarker} We were given sort of an example of a coffee machine or something ,\nproject manager: Uh-huh , yeah .\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm .\nmarketing: right ? Well , um are we at ma right now on the assumption that our television remote control may have features which go beyond the television ? Or are we keeping sort of like a a design commitment to television features ?\nproject manager: Th Okay , well just very quickly\nmarketing: I I don't know .\nproject manager: 'cause this {disfmarker} we're supposed to finish now . Um I guess that's up to us ,\nmarketing: Yep . Yeah , sure .\nproject manager: I mean you probably want some kind of unique selling point of it , so um , you know {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Okay .\nindustrial designer: I think one factor would be production cost .\nmarketing: Okay , yeah .\nindustrial designer: Because there's a cap there ,\nproject manager: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: so um depends on how much you can cram into that price . Um .\nmarketing: Okay .\nproject manager: Mm-hmm .\nmarketing: Okay .\nindustrial designer: I think that that's the main factor .\nproject manager: Yeah . Okay .\nmarketing: Okay .\nproject manager: Right , okay , we'll that's that's the end of the meeting , then . Um\nmarketing: Alright . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So , uh\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: thank you all for coming . {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} Cool .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}"}]}
