So , we will first start by summarizing the mm {vocalsound} the previous meeting and the decision we've taken . Uh I will take notes during this meeting so uh that you can uh look at my uh folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards . So each of you will uh show us the various investigation they've done during uh previous uh hours . We'll then t take decision in concert and then uh uh we will uh define the nest {disfmarker} next task , to have {disfmarker} to be done before the next meeting . So , last time we decided to have a simple interface . We also decided to have a wheel to change channel {disfmarker} previous channel button . Channel digit uh buttons should be uh protected by plastic cover or something for the remote control to look very simple . We have also button for volume , and to switch on off the T_V_ . We have also uh the lightening feature for the remote control to be easy to find , and for fast development and low cost we have decided to have no L_C_D_ no voice features . So now uh we will have three presentations . So the conceptual specification by Industrial Designer , the specification of the U_I_ by {disfmarker} or U_I_ {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Abdul al-Hasred is my name .\nproject manager: okay . {vocalsound} And uh the last point is uh trend watching by Market Expert . So maybe we can start with uh industrial design . So this is the presentation .\nindustrial designer: Uh , I_D_ you want ?\nproject manager: Maybe I can switch slide uh on your request .\nindustrial designer: Yeah . I only v have three slides , so . I just look at the mm {disfmarker} um just this . On some web pages to find some documentation\nproject manager: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: and I think a remote control is , as I s mentioned previously , you just have a a very simple chip and the mm the user interface is just done usually by push button and in our case we are using a um a wheel control . So uh uh I was looking basically for that chip , which is uh very very standard , and uh I just looked for the wheel sensor and the standard push button . And um {vocalsound} yeah we can change directly ."}, {"chapter": 2, "start_ms": 66000, "topic": "Functional features to include in the remote", "transcript_text": "industrial designer: In fact I have the number of that element which is very standard for remote control . The push button are usually extremely cheap , but I just have one problem and this is related with the wheel sensor , which seems to be quite expensive .\nproject manager: Okay .\nuser interface: Mm-hmm .\nindustrial designer: And I think we if we could just talk about that if we really need a wheel sensor or if we can not {disfmarker} if if we could combine something with the push button .\nproject manager: Okay .\nindustrial designer: Uh a wheel sensor is fifty time the price of a a a push button .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nproject manager: But is it a significant price on the whole remote control ?\nuser interface: Mm .\nproject manager: Because we can afford up to twelve Euros for the price of the remote control .\nindustrial designer: Yeah . Yeah\nproject manager: So will will will this with uh including all possible things , so buttons , wheel and the chip , be uh lower than twelve Euros to produce ?\nindustrial designer: I I th {vocalsound} But I don't think that uh we should {disfmarker} We should talk about uh the design of the box also which needs some money .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nproject manager: Okay\nuser interface: Also have to say {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: But {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Did you receive the email about the voice recognition ?\nindustrial designer: Um that's all {vocalsound}\nuser interface: No ?\nproject manager: You received something {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: yeah . I haven't chec\nuser interface: Yeah . You we uh an email from the manufacturing division that they have basically a voice recognition chip already developed .\nproject manager: Hmm .\nuser interface: Says {disfmarker} Yeah . It says that ri right now they just use it to uh to record uh answers to particular questions . But I guess it could be {disfmarker}\nproject manager: And could it be adapted ?\nuser interface: I guess it's possible . I mean instead of recording the answers you can just uh record uh something simpler like a command .\nproject manager: Okay and there can uh recognize some commands and stuff ?\nuser interface: Yeah you reco recognize commands and you can record new commands and stuff , so if they already have it as uh as a chip\nproject manager: Okay . Yeah .\nuser interface: then we we could use it .\nproject manager: Okay maybe we can just uh listen to this presentation and then take decision later on {disfmarker} according to those news .\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm .\nuser interface: Okay .\nindustrial designer: Yeah but I think it's yeah {disfmarker} Sorry , I haven't written my personal references . Um {vocalsound} the I I just want to mention the the problem of the the r wheels sensor which is much more expensive than any push button ,\nproject manager: Okay .\nindustrial designer: and if we could reduce that . We we have already some good things uh with um um with the backlight of the push button .\nuser interface: Mm-hmm . I have a question about that actually {vocalsound} . Um , what is the purpose of the light ?\nindustrial designer: Just to to make something which is uh slightly more design that uh a squarey box with a rubber {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Is {disfmarker}\nproject manager: You can easily find the button in the dark or so ?\nuser interface: But {disfmarker} But in th in the dark uh {disfmarker} Yeah but is going to be always turned on , the light ?\nproject manager: It will be turned on when the when the user move the remote control I think , no ?\nuser interface: But if you move it then you have it , you don't need to find it .\nproject manager: Hmm .\nuser interface: You can see the buttons better , of course .\nproject manager: Yeah . Yeah .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nproject manager: Yeah . True .\nindustrial designer: Yeah . Actually .\nuser interface: But if you move it then you have to have some sensor to {disfmarker} when you move it to detect your movement .\nindustrial designer: As soon as you thought to move the the remote control you have the light .\nuser interface: Yeah , but you need another sensor for that , right ?\nindustrial designer: Yeah . Again .\nuser interface: Yeah {vocalsound} no it's too expensive . {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I don't think that this is really expensive , but at the end this is plenty of unexpen eh very cheap devices but uh the bill starts to be {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Okay . Mm . Extra . Yeah , okay . Mm . Yeah , but I expected also the wheel would be cheap but you tell me that it is very expensive so ,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} First of all I was thinking to have a a continuous light\nuser interface: yeah .\nindustrial designer: and you w when t you you you you press the on button you have the light on your remote control , when you want to turn off your device {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Mm . Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: But it can be uh battery consuming , no ? To have the light always on ?\nindustrial designer: Yeah , a little bit . A little bit .\nuser interface: Mm .\nproject manager: Well we will discuss that after maybe\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nuser interface: Okay\nproject manager: the other presentations .\nuser interface: . So uh my one , it uh should be in the shared folder .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nuser interface: So . It was last time I saw it .\nproject manager: And it is .\nuser interface: Okay . So ,\nproject manager: Okay .\nuser interface: {vocalsound} just move to the next slide . {vocalsound} So basically {vocalsound} want very simple , right ? That's the major idea , as simple as possible .\nproject manager: Yeah . Yeah .\nuser interface: So I just look at some current designs uh on the web , of usually more complicated remote controls . And let's look at two of them because uh th even though they have many buttons they look quite simple . And in our case we just uh reject the buttons what we don't need and it become even simpler ."}, {"chapter": 3, "start_ms": 540000, "topic": "Ensuring ease of use", "transcript_text": "project manager: And also does it uh fit well in hand ? Because it was uh th your wrist problem with the usage .\nuser interface: Yeah . Well this these uh these remotes are quite big , so go to the next page , so . We have all these buttons as you can see , but most of them , we just need the ones in the middle .\nproject manager: Yeah {vocalsound} . Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nuser interface: So , from the bottom or whatever is there , uh the uh the numbers and then the top , uh until the ten also , this middle part ,\nproject manager: Yeah . Yeah .\nuser interface: and on the left one is exactly the same . So it's basically more or less how we would like it , with a big volume control , big channel control , and mute and power , yeah ?\nproject manager: Yeah .\nuser interface: These are the basic thing .\nproject manager: So it's only the central part .\nuser interface: So basically , w software we will build will look more or less the same as these two .\nproject manager: Yeah . With a maybe a more ergonomic design on on the bottom part .\nuser interface: Yeah , if you have , for example {vocalsound} {disfmarker} I think that the volume and the buttons that are there on the top are not very easy to reach with your thumb .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nuser interface: It could be on the right side , for example .\nproject manager: Okay .\nuser interface: Yeah . Because we don't have these input buttons and this other stuff that they have . And I think that the plastic cover is not very good uh idea because\nproject manager: Okay .\nuser interface: you open it , it can break , you ca you can do various things .\nproject manager: Okay . S\nuser interface: Uh you just need to put the channel numbers somewhere a bit out of the way .\nproject manager: Okay . Will be down or {disfmarker}\nuser interface: So that they're separate a bit ,\nproject manager: Okay .\nuser interface: yeah . Uh and it's easy to press the other {disfmarker} the big buttons , but uh , it's not that difficult to press the the channel buttons either . Mm . Yeah , I think that if you put the cover it will be even more difficult for the user .\nproject manager: Okay .\nuser interface: Alright , you won't {disfmarker} yeah . Usually what {disfmarker} I have noticed that people put the plastic cover on things that you normally don't mess with , like buttons for t uh tuning the channels and stuff like that .\nproject manager: Okay .\nuser interface: Yeah . That you want to protect a bit . And I think it's uh it's reasonable .\nproject manager: Okay .\nuser interface: So , I don't think {disfmarker} Yeah , this is just the the wheel .\nproject manager: Mm .\nuser interface: We could use the {disfmarker} some wheels can be pushed down , could use the push down of the wheel for the record if we want .\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm .\nuser interface: Uh so we could just basically use one just wheel and uh user could use just the wheel to do everything with the channels in that case .\nproject manager: Yeah . Maybe the wheel will be a {vocalsound} good advantage over our competitors .\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: Because otherwise it's pretty standard apart the fact that it's very simple . So maybe it's worse to uh to have more expense on that's that aspect .\nindustrial designer: To s Mm-hmm .\nuser interface: Yeah , I guess the market researcher will tell us all about that .\nproject manager: Okay . So we can move to the {disfmarker} Is there any question ? For designer of user interface ? {vocalsound} or we can move to the next part , maybe , and discuss afterwards ? Okay ."}, {"chapter": 4, "start_ms": 798000, "topic": "Choosing a stylish fruit for remote design", "transcript_text": "marketing: Can I ? {vocalsound} So now the recent investigation we we have done fo of the remote control um . So , the most important aspect for remote controls is to be fancy look and feel and not current functional look and feel . And um the second aspect is uh that the remote control should be uh technological innovative .\nproject manager: Okay .\nmarketing: {vocalsound} And the third most important aspect is to to {disfmarker} is that the co remote control should be easy to use . So , are things we are we have uh speak about before .\nuser interface: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nmarketing: Yeah . And um {disfmarker} so you you can go {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Yeah .\nmarketing: after . And there is a fashion watchers in Paris and Milan that have detected the following trends , uh fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes , shoes , and furnitures . {vocalsound} So , maybe if our {vocalsound} remote control have to be a fruit form or vegetable form {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay .\nmarketing: something like that , or {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: I support an apple .\nmarketing: {vocalsound} And the mm the material is expected to be spongy .\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Uh I don't know which material {vocalsound} can be spongy ,\nproject manager: Yeah .\nmarketing: and if you {disfmarker}\nproject manager: This is good also for {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Well , wou wou I think we can certainly just put the electronics in a spongy thing ,\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nuser interface: it it would work , right ?\nproject manager: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: I think it is good also f to have a spongy material , yeah .\nuser interface: You can throw it to the television .\nproject manager: Yeah , because it's robust .\nmarketing: Okay {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah . Me too .\nmarketing: It's robust , yeah .\nuser interface: Hey that's a cool one . We could say that if you throw it , you have a sensor , and you throw it and hits the television and turns it off .\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: When it d uh takes a shock .\nproject manager: Yeah\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Not good .\nproject manager: uh sorry ?\nindustrial designer: Ah it's okay . I know that they do that for alarm clock also .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nmarketing: An and and uh this uh you can yeah you can say that . You ca uh you can go uh before\nproject manager: No . Yeah . Before ?\nmarketing: , before , yes . And you know here the more iz important aspect is the fancy look and feel , after is uh technological innovative , and after the easy to use .\nproject manager: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . I think it's innovative to use the mm the wheel because I think no one else has .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nmarketing: Yeah that's why {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Has it ?\nmarketing: Yeah that's why I think we have to keep that if it's possible .\nproject manager: Yeah . I think it's {disfmarker} it makes it both easy and both innos innovative .\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm .\nmarketing: Innovative . Mm .\nproject manager: So I think it's a good aspect and it should be kept .\nuser interface: How do we make it look cool is the question .\nproject manager: Cool , fancy ?\nuser interface: Yeah .\nproject manager: We have to make it l look like a fruit or vegetable . {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: Maybe uh um {vocalsound} a colour that remember some fruit uh , things like that .\nindustrial designer: What about um {disfmarker}\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Mm . Oh , colour , yeah .\nuser interface: Well the obvious thing is a banana , I guess .\nmarketing: Oh {disfmarker} i i {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Maybe yeah .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I thought about a a pear , for example . You know the pear , is like that and it's it's easy to to have in in hand\nproject manager: Yeah , and it's ergonomic as well .\nmarketing: and uh {disfmarker} Yeah .\nproject manager: A pear .\nuser interface: The banana is also ergonomic .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah . Maybe pear yeah or something like that .\nmarketing: Or a fruit like that . I dunno .\nproject manager: Yeah . We can discuss that uh . D D Is is there anything you want to add ?\nuser interface: Is there any fruit that is spongy ?\nmarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound} I don't think so . I think we we can have like yeah a pear is good , fit well , or banana as you told .\nuser interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Something like that .\nindustrial designer: And for maybe look and feel , what about a a piece of ice , with blue L_E_D_ inside ?\nproject manager: But that's not in the trend . {vocalsound} .\nuser interface: You can make it um {disfmarker}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: The trend is spongy , and vegetable fruits .\nindustrial designer: Yeah . Yeah . {vocalsound}\nuser interface: It's not hard , the metal .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound} I think p spongy is good because it it will be robust as well .\nindustrial designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Plastic . {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yep .\nproject manager: So , I think we can keep the wheel because it's uh easy , it's innovative , even if the cost is a bit higher ,\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nproject manager: and we also have to find a , so , a fruit like pear or banana wit uh any others idea you have . What kind of fr fruit would you like to to control your T_V_ with ? {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Mm .\nproject manager: Odi\nindustrial designer: Banana I think , it's a nice idea .\nproject manager: Banana is also yellow so you you can't lost your remote control then .\nindustrial designer: Because {disfmarker} But {disfmarker}\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: You y you don't use the banana when the banana is curving like that ,\nuser interface: Two of the button , yeah .\nindustrial designer: but when the banana is curving like that , with the wheel on the top and to control ,\nuser interface: Yeah . Yeah .\nindustrial designer: and here you have a a push button to {disfmarker}\nmarketing: But you don't have {disfmarker}\nproject manager: I think it's a good idea , yeah .\nuser interface: Yeah so you can just have uh just have this curve , yeah , and you move uh your hand here to press the buttons and then you move uh on the other side .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nuser interface: So you can have it on on two sides and it'll be cool ,\nproject manager: Yeah .\nuser interface: no ?\nproject manager: I think it's a good design and it's innovative as well then . Maybe we can keep the banana . And it will be very easy to find .\nindustrial designer: And everybody knows what is a banana .\nuser interface: You can put also vibrator inside .\nindustrial designer: Basically .\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nindustrial designer: If you if you start with uh fancy fruits and fra s and tha\nuser interface: Ah-ha . You can also take into account the fact that the banana fits with the colour scheme of our company .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Oh , yeah {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah it's really uh really a good point ."}, {"chapter": 5, "start_ms": 1590000, "topic": "Adapting features to a banana shaped remote", "transcript_text": "project manager: I think it {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} One second . So we have to take some decision on this aspect . So , uh so for {disfmarker}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: sorry , for uh component , so {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: So {disfmarker}\nproject manager: we have to think about those aspects , sorry .\nindustrial designer: So we will just use a a standard battery ?\nproject manager: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: And uh the chip we {disfmarker} chip imprint we know exactly which one we are going to use . Uh what do you mean by case ?\nproject manager: I think it's the box that should be spongy , banana's shape .\nindustrial designer: Yeah . Uh I mean for me if we use a a spongy banana case , doesn't matter .\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I just want to have so something to prin to to fix my my components onto that box , and that's it .\nuser interface: The only th Yeah . Y Yeah that can be in inside th in the structure .\nindustrial designer: Yeah yeah . Yeah .\nuser interface: But uh the thing is that the buttons and the wheel have to be {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: Spongy also .\nuser interface: I mean if it's spongy then the buttons and the wheel have to {disfmarker} I mean if it's spongy then it's going to move , right ? So , it's going to be bend a lot .\nproject manager: But {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: Oh no I think it's possible .\nuser interface: So if we try to push the buttons , it {disfmarker}\nproject manager: No the button would be {disfmarker}\nuser interface: You think it's possible ?\nproject manager: In fact it it should be something odd shaped , with a spongy cover .\nindustrial designer: Yeah . Yeah\nuser interface: Okay .\nindustrial designer: . This is uh like the {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Yeah .\nproject manager: Okay odd shape with spongy {disfmarker} cover . And standard battery okay , a chip imprint , there's no specific problem . So we agree to put the wheel {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} Wheel on the top . Button , where do we want some buttons ?\nuser interface: Well , usually hold {disfmarker} {vocalsound} 'Kay , we want it to be good also for the left-hand users , right ?\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nproject manager: So it have to {disfmarker} it has to be symmetrical .\nuser interface: Uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah but okay . Sa let's say that th o {vocalsound} It has to be {disfmarker} basically you can only take two sides , one on ths this side where is the thumb and the other side where there is uh yeah also the thumb .\nindustrial designer: Yep .\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yep .\nuser interface: {vocalsound} Basically . Or you could use use this one , but I don't know if it's very comfortable , to use this one for the wheel .\nproject manager: Yeah maybe the thumb is more comfortable .\nuser interface: This for the wheel and then this for the buttons ?\nproject manager: Yeah I think it's okay for both right and left . Mm .\nuser interface: Should have the two sides .\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm .\nuser interface: So if {gap} the left , we have {disfmarker} the op\nproject manager: I think you can turn it this way also . You can do both with both hands .\nuser interface: Wheel {disfmarker} Wheel buttons .\nproject manager: I think it's okay .\nuser interface: Yeah , the problem is if you have buttons and wheel then when you turn it around , the buttons are on the other side . So you cannot see them .\nproject manager: Well , you you will get used to it .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nproject manager: And moreover , th the button ar are lighted so you you immediately identify the right side , because you have light on buttons .\nuser interface: So the buttons have to be here and the wheel has to be {disfmarker} Y Yeah I know , but uh if you hold with your left hand , and the wheel is here , and the buttons are here , then when you turn it around the buttons will be on the other side .\nproject manager: Yeah . No you you {disfmarker} I think you will use it only on the right or left hand , whether you are righty or lefty . I think for lefty it's okay . I can do this movement , and for righty as well . I think this doesn't change that much .\nuser interface: Okay .\nproject manager: Yeah ?\nuser interface: Okay . Maybe . Yeah .\nproject manager: So , for interface we said also that we have uh this banana shape with button on the s on the side . And {disfmarker} and uh a wheel on the top .\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nproject manager: So the colour is yellow . I think it's uh {disfmarker} we defined everything according to what we should {disfmarker} what the decision we should take , yeah . So maybe we can um we can uh work on those aspects uh until next meeting . So have the final uh look and feel design according to the decision . And have the the user interface design and uh then evaluate the prodyuc {disfmarker} the product . That is to say , uh check if it fit the the requirement uh given by the users , but according to uh your presentation it seems to be okay . It seems to be fancy , innovative , and easy to use ."}]}
