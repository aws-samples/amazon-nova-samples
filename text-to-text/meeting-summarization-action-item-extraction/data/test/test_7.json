Um well , the function {vocalsound} of a remote control , as what uh we've been informed , is basically to send messages to the television set , for example , switch it on , switch it off , go to this channel , go to channel nine , turn the volume up , etcetera . Um some of the considerations is just um for example the what it needs to include it's the numbers , you know , zero to nine , so you can move to a channel , the power button on slash off , the channel going up and down , volume going up and down , and then mute , a mute function . And then functions for V_H_S_ , D_V_D_ , for example , play , rewind , fast-forward , stop , pause , enter . And enter would be for like , you know , the menus . {vocalsound} And then other menus for D_V_ as well as T_V_ , whether that means like um we can go and decide the brightness of the screen , things like that , all the more complicated functions of menus .\nproject manager: {gap}\nuser interface: And we can decide if that's what we want , {gap} , um if we want to include that on the remote , if that's something that would stay on the T_V_ itself , for example .\nproject manager: Okay . Okay .\nuser interface: These are two examples . Um and you can see on the left , it's got a lot more buttons ,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: and I don't know if you can read it , but it says , step , go to , freeze , um slow , repeat , program , mute , and so those are some of the buttons and so it gives you an idea of s one example . And then on the right , it's a lot more simpler , it's got volume , it's got the play the like circle set , which is play , rewind , but it's also what is {disfmarker} fast-forward is also like next on a menu . So you have functions that are d uh duplicating .\nproject manager: Right .\nuser interface: And you have a mute button and then the numbers and the eject , and the power button . So that gives you two different kinds , a more complex and more simple version . Okay .\nproject manager: Ready .\nuser interface: And then lastly , it's just the questions that we want to consider like what functions do we want it to include , and how simple , complex it should be ? And what functions it needs to complete . Uh , what are needed to complete insulation process , 'cause , you know , that's something that also has to be considered and it's gonna be hopefully a one-time thing , when you set it up it should be set to go , but we have to include the functions that can allow it to set up i in the first place .\nproject manager: {gap}\nuser interface: So that's it .\nproject manager: Alright . Very good presentation . Thank you . You speak with such authority on the matter ."}, {"chapter": 2, "start_ms": 270000, "topic": "Presentation on functional requirements", "transcript_text": "project manager: 'Kay . Alright . Now we have Courtney with the functional requirements .\nmarketing: Yes , okay so we tested a hundred subjects in our lab , and we just we watched them and we also made them fill out a questionnaire , and we found that the {vocalsound} users are not typically happy with current remote controls . Seventy five percent think they're ugly . Eighty percent want {disfmarker} they've {disfmarker} are willing to spend more , which is good news for us um if we make it look fancier , and basically w we just need something that really I mean there's some other points up there , but they {disfmarker} it needs to be snazzy and it {disfmarker} but yet simple .\nuser interface: {gap} Wait .\nmarketing: So that's really what we need to do . And we need we need it to be simple , yet it needs to be high-tech looking . So {disfmarker}\nuser interface: And that meaning what ?\nmarketing: Like {disfmarker} They like I guess use the buttons a lot .\nuser interface: Okay .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nuser interface: {gap}\nmarketing: I don't know . It's from my uh research .\nproject manager: Okay , what do you m\nuser interface: Right .\nmarketing: My team wasn't very clear .\nproject manager: Oh , I'm sorry .\nuser interface: Only use ten percent of the buttons .\nproject manager: What do you mean by um the current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user , like they have to press the buttons .\nmarketing: {vocalsound} That's okay . I I think it's like the engineering versus user ,\nproject manager: Okay .\nmarketing: whereas like the engineering she showed that the engineering ones are more complex\nproject manager: Oh , right .\nmarketing: and users don't really need all of the buttons that are contained on there , because they only use ten percent of the buttons really .\nproject manager: The buttons . Okay .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah . Okay .\nindustrial designer: We only use ten per cent of our brains . {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Good point .\nproject manager: It works .\nmarketing: It's a necessary evil .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} yeah .\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Ready for the next slide ?\nmarketing: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} And so people say that they typically lose it , as you yourself know , because you probably lose your remote control all the time ,\nproject manager: Hmm .\nmarketing: much like any small appliance like a cellphone ,\nuser interface: Lost .\nmarketing: and they {disfmarker} we need something simple , because most people , well thirty four percent say that it's just too much time to learn how to use a new one , and we don't want to go {disfmarker} we don't want to vary too far from the normal standard remote ,\nuser interface: S\nmarketing: but I mean they do need to be able to identify it , and R_S_I_ , I'm not very sure what that is .\nproject manager: It's okay . It's very important . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yes , it is important for the remote control world .\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Wait , is that like your {disfmarker} ergonomics like your hand movements or something ?\nmarketing: Sh\nproject manager: Could be , yeah .\nmarketing: Uh possibly .\nindustrial designer: Do we really need t to provide more information on what R_S_I_ is ?\nuser interface: Like {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Oh .\nmarketing: Uh yeah , that's what my web site said , I\nuser interface: Channel , volume , power .\nproject manager: I think that's a pretty good guess though .\nmarketing: don't know .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah , I would assume so .\nuser interface: It's like if you're holding it {disfmarker}\nmarketing: I think we're supposed to know it as remote control experts .\nproject manager: Yeah . It's okay . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound} But also s so the channel , the volume and the power buttons are the most important on our company website you can find like the specific statistics concerning to how much each button is used , but those are the definitely the top ones .\nproject manager: Okay . Next slide ?\nmarketing: Yes . And so personally I think that we need a modern eye-catching design , but it it really needs to be simple . So saying from y your slide , your presentation , the engineering versus the user-specified remotes , I think that we should go with something that's more user-friendly .\nproject manager: User-friendly .\nmarketing: Where the engineering ones , the boxes , tend to make it look more complicated than it really is . Um the functionality of the product really needs to be considered as to like what type of buttons do we really need on it . And it needs to be open to a wide range of consumers , so even though we need a small number of buttons , we also need to take in {disfmarker} like are most people going to be using it for a D_V_D_ player , a TiVo , what what exactly are we using it for , as well as the age range . So we need a hip , but not a corny marketing scheme for promoting our product .\nuser interface: {gap}\nmarketing: And also we found {disfmarker} our team found that speech recognition is {disfmarker} it's like an up-and-coming thing they really {disfmarker} consumers are really interested in it , and since our findings found that people are willing to pay more money for a remote for it to be more high-class we could consider it .\nproject manager: And so just to {disfmarker} just to clarify by speech recognition you mean they would say , channel five , and the thing would go to channel five ?\nmarketing: I guess so , yeah .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay .\nuser interface: {gap} to just say , where are you , and thing beeps , you know . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Oh , that'd be lovely .\nmarketing: Yeah , I guess we can interpret it like , we can just try out different types of speech recognition within our remote programme .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Didn't they {disfmarker} um didn't our rival companies manufacture a remote that you would press the button on the T_V_ and it would {disfmarker} the remote would beep so if you have lost it {disfmarker}\nuser interface: It's kinda like what the remote phone used to do .\nproject manager: Mm . Oh , yeah , that's true .\nuser interface: You know like go to the base .\nproject manager: We could definitely include that if we wanted to .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nproject manager: If it's within our price . Okay . Are we ready for our last presentation , Amber ?"}, {"chapter": 3, "start_ms": 786000, "topic": "Presentation on the working design", "transcript_text": "industrial designer: 'Kay . Uh I didn't get a chance to complete this one , 'cause some of the tools that I was given were frustrating .\nproject manager: Oh my bad . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Oh that's fine .\nindustrial designer: Uh okay , so method method of our design , I think I just start listing th some of the things that we actually need to put into this .\nuser interface: Help me .\nindustrial designer: We need a power source , we're gonna need a smart chip if we're gonna make it multi-functional . Um extra functions will probably need an additional chip . Either that or the smart chip will have to be extremely smart .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: What exactly is a smart chip ?\nindustrial designer: Usually a smart chip is just a chip that's been programmed and designed so that it can complete a fair range of functions .\nuser interface: Well , how much extra would the additional chip be ? Is that gonna push us over our production costs ?\nindustrial designer: I wouldn't think so , 'cause we could probably get it from like , in bulk , from a a newer company . And they tend to sell their chips pretty cheap .\nuser interface: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: Okay . Ready ?\nindustrial designer: Um yep , nothing here .\nproject manager: That's okay .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Um power source , I figured , batteries , 'cause they're easily available . Typically a remote has either two double A_s or four triple A_s , sometimes three . Uh it really kinda depends on the size of the actual remote itself .\nuser interface: {gap}\nindustrial designer: Um a large on-off button , {vocalsound} demographically we're moving towards an older generation of people , so a large on-off button would probably be good .\nuser interface: {vocalsound} {gap}\nproject manager: Hmm .\nindustrial designer: Selection button for various entertainment devices , so you want something that will permit you to select the D_V_D_ player or the T_V_ or the stereo system . Um smart chip that perverts {disfmarker} uh that permits , sorry , universal application again , something that'll allow us to skip over between devices , and that's kinda it .\nproject manager: {gap}\nindustrial designer: Uh this is my fifty second design .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Power source over here . We're gonna have a switch obviously between the power source and the rest of it , and you're gonna need the switch . Um extra bulb could just be for flashiness , um subcomponent which would be like a way of diverting the power to different parts of the the device . Um the chip and of course the infra-red bulb , so it can communicate with the various devices that it needs to talk to .\nmarketing: So what exactly we are looking at , is this like the front of the remote ?\nindustrial designer: This is just like a rough schematic .\nproject manager: So this would be the front ?\nindustrial designer: So this is the internal workings .\nproject manager: So the red would be the front of the remote though , right ?\nmarketing: Oh okay .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nproject manager: Okay .\nuser interface: Yeah , that's gonna be what's communicating with the T_V_ , but the other bulb , I think , is good to just to indicate , I'm doing something , it's sort of like a reassurance .\nproject manager: The l {vocalsound} the light up kind of {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: Yeah , so you don't have to stare at that infra-red ,\nmarketing: Like that we know the battery's working .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: 'cause you know when the battery starts dying in your remote currently , you have to actually stare at that bulb and go , okay , when I push this button , is it working ?\nproject manager: Hmm . It'd probably be lighting up the key too ,\nmarketing: Okay .\nindustrial designer: We can skip that whole thing .\nproject manager: right ?\nindustrial designer: Yep .\nproject manager: 'Kay .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: So you can put it in the dark . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: The buttons .\nmarketing: Yeah , and that's good .\nproject manager: Okay .\nmarketing: We should make it glow in the dark . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah , definitely . 'Kay nex R Ready ?\nindustrial designer: Yeah , that's it .\nproject manager: 'Kay , any p 'Kay ?\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Mm 'kay .\nproject manager: Anything you wanna add for personal preferences though , you f you said already that we needed a large on-off button , you think . Anything else ?\nindustrial designer: I think that that's a good idea , because you know that's one of the most important buttons .\nuser interface: Just {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Okay .\nuser interface: Well , should it be larger buttons in general , you know like uh the examples that I had , they were swi quite small . So should we try and go for something that has l larger buttons ?\nmarketing: I think we should . Like I think that would be in a as in {disfmarker} like in {disfmarker} for the design , sorry , um . I think we should definitely go with buttons that don't look like a normal remote , 'cause most remotes have small square buttons ,\nproject manager: Mm .\nmarketing: I think we should do something like maybe bigger and round like bubbles .\nuser interface: Ovals . Yeah , yeah ."}, {"chapter": 4, "start_ms": 1188000, "topic": "Additional discussion on function design based on the presentations", "transcript_text": "project manager: Okay . Okay , let's talk about all of our {disfmarker} We'll come to decision later about all the components that we need to include , let's um wrap up this one , and {vocalsound} I'm gonna go back to my PowerPoint , 'cause we need to discuss the new project requirements which you might've already seen flashed up on the screen a bit earlier . {vocalsound} Wait , come back . Alright . Sorry , let's go through this . Alright . Here we go . New product requirements . First it's only going to be a T_V_ remote . We're trying not to over-complicate things . So no D_V_D_ , no TiVo , no stereo .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} Okay .\nproject manager: It's not gonna be multi-functional .\nuser interface: {gap}\nproject manager: Hey . And we th need to promote our company more , so we need to somehow include our colour and our company slogan on the remote . We're trying to get our name out there in the world . Okay .\nuser interface: {gap}\nproject manager: And you know what teletext is ?\nuser interface: Yeah .\nproject manager: {gap} in States we don't have it , but um it's like they just have this channel where just has news and weather , kind of sports ,\nuser interface: I know .\nmarketing: What is it ?\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: it's very um bland looking , it's just text on the screen ,\nuser interface: Yeah ,\nproject manager: not even {disfmarker}\nuser interface: it's like black , black and white kind of {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Yeah , just black with just text .\nmarketing: Like running along the bottom ?\nproject manager: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: You can also get the kind of the T_V_ guide so {disfmarker}\nuser interface: It'll give you the sports .\nmarketing: Wait , is it like the Weather Channel where it's got like the ticker running on the bottom or something ?\nproject manager: Kind of .\nuser interface: Except the entire screen .\nproject manager: Yeah it's the whole screen .\nindustrial designer: It's the entire screen is just running information at random .\nproject manager: So anyway {disfmarker}\nuser interface: You can pick sports , you can pick the news , you entertainment ,\nindustrial designer: Seemingly .\nuser interface: you know it's like {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Right .\nmarketing: So it's like a separate channel from like what you're watching ?\nproject manager: Right . But it's becoming out-dated now , because of the Internet .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nproject manager: Nobody needs to go to the teletext channel to check the news , {vocalsound} and we have twenty four hour news channels now too , so {disfmarker} Those are our new product requirements . Alright . Mm-hmm .\nindustrial designer: Okay .\nmarketing: Okay .\nindustrial designer: So , do we have to include the company colour within that ?\nproject manager: Yes . It's part of the logo . Okay .\nuser interface: Company colour being yellow . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: What we're going to do right now is come to some decisions , definitive that we can all agree on , about um the target group and the functions and just definite things that we need to do and then we'll close up the meeting . So . Alright . {gap} Whatever . Okay . So our target group is {disfmarker} You mentioned um older people ? Would it just be universal for everyone , you think ?\nuser interface: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: Because I think even if something has large buttons , as long as they are not childishly large , like even technically {disfmarker}\nuser interface: It's gonna make it nicer . Yeah .\nproject manager: non-technically challenged people are gonna use it . I mean they want something user-friendly , so {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: Mm well , even if we kept the regular standard size of remote , if we reduced the buttons down to the ones that people are saying that they use the most often and a couple extra ,\nproject manager: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: 'cause they're saying they only use ten per cent of them ,\nproject manager: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: then we should be able to accommodate fairly decent sized buttons .\nproject manager: Okay , so we want um for our target group would we say , I mean , young and old , all age ranges , all um , not kids obviously , right ? Or kids ?\nmarketing: No , kids need to know how to use a remote , I would think .\nindustrial designer: Most of them will intuitively pick it up though .\nproject manager: {gap}\nmarketing: They gotta change between Disney Channel , Cartoon Network .\nproject manager: Okay , so we're going to go anywhere from kids to adult in the age range {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Yeah , I think we need it all .\nproject manager: Um what about technic technical um specifications , like how how technically literate are these people who are going to be using our remote ?\nindustrial designer: {gap}\nmarketing: Um I would say we should say dumber than the average person .\nproject manager: Okay .\nuser interface: We should go for the lowest denominator .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: Right , okay . So so they need no technical experience to operate {disfmarker}\nuser interface: High school educated .\nindustrial designer: {gap} how 'bout little to no , because there is no way that you are gonna be able to make it no .\nproject manager: Okay . And we also need to determine the specific functions of this , just to get it all out on paper . So we said it needs to send messages to the T_V_ , needs to change the channel , turn on and off , just basic simple stuff like this . So if you have something just say it and we'll add it to my meeting minutes .\nuser interface: Well it's channel , on-off button , volume , mute .\nproject manager: Mm-hmm , volume .\nmarketing: And channel . Yeah . Those are the most important ones .\nproject manager: Right . And we wanna keep um {disfmarker} I'll make a note here that we wanna keep the number of buttons down . Correct , because people only use ten percent .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: 'Kay . Hey , what else ?\nuser interface: Um .\nproject manager: Um .\nindustrial designer: Do we want this thing to be able to be found easily ?\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I think so . What do you {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Sure , yeah .\nuser interface: {gap}\nproject manager: A finding kind of device or {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: And\nmarketing: I need {disfmarker} we we need a like homing device .\nproject manager: Yeah , ho homing device . {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: like if this is gonna get lost underneath the coach , how are we going to accommodate the quick ability to find it ?\nuser interface: Oh right yeah okay .\nproject manager: Mm 'kay .\nuser interface: Tracking .\nproject manager: Okay .\nmarketing: Because people really are looking for a remote that's more high-tech .\nproject manager: Right .\nindustrial designer: What if we gave it a charger ? And on the charger , just like a phone , like you get a portable phone and it's got a charger , and if you d leave your phone somewhere , you push the button to find it , and it finds th the phone beeps for you .\nuser interface: But you got a base .\nmarketing: Do you think people'll really go for that though ?\nindustrial designer: It's useful for the remote phone .\nmarketing: Because {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Hmm .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: Would that add to our costs at all , I wonder ?\nmarketing: I would think so , because you'd have to develop a base .\nproject manager: Right .\nuser interface: Well , if you have the base , you could start putting in a charger and then you have a different kind of battery .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nmarketing: Hmm .\nindustrial designer: Rechargeable batteries are cheaper usually .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nproject manager: Okay . I I think we can make a decision about that later . Uh we'll still put that as a point that we need to discuss . So that would include battery source {disfmarker} Power source rather . Is it going to have a charger , or is it going to be run strictly off batteries ? And we also need to deal with the issue you mentioned of speech recognition , if we want that .\nmarketing: Right .\nuser interface: Well , then we could {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Do w\nuser interface: If we have the speech recognition then we can start aiming at a like another kind of more handicapped disabled uh demo demographic .\nproject manager: Mm .\nmarketing: Well , th there's the people who desire speech recognition , there's the different demog demographics have different desires , I don't know if you guys ge\nproject manager: You could um {disfmarker} we could hook it up .\nmarketing: It wouldn't copy onto the the thing 'cause it's black ,\nproject manager: Oh .\nmarketing: but all the different age groups have different desires for speech recognition . So {vocalsound} basically older people don't really care .\nuser interface: {gap}\nmarketing: It's really the people twenty five to thirty five . I feel those are the people that really watch a lot of T_V_ though .\nproject manager: Mm-hmm .\nmarketing: They're the ones that get addicted to soap operas and\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: And if and if we introduced it when they're this age , they're going to probably always buy a remote that has {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Well {disfmarker}\nmarketing: just sitcoms and stuff . Right .\nuser interface: Well , then then do you put the voice recognition {disfmarker} do you put the r like receiver on the actual television , in the base , or in the actual remote ,\nmarketing: So {disfmarker}\nuser interface: 'cause then you've already got remote in your hand , why you just gonna speak to the remote ,\nproject manager: Right .\nuser interface: whereas if you just speak in general and you don't have to have the remote in your hand and like talk at it .\nproject manager: Yeah . {gap} and the speech recognition could be part of the lost and found device , too . If we said , find remote , locate remote , or something .\nmarketing: Right .\nproject manager: A certain phrase then it could beep . I dunno . Just throwing it out there .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Still {gap} fifteen minutes .\nproject manager: Okay , anything else we wanna discuss ?\nuser interface: Um . Well , do we wanna include the numbers like zero through nine ? Can we conceive of leaving them out ?\nproject manager: Um .\nmarketing: Wait , on the remote itself ?\nproject manager: {gap}\nuser interface: Yeah , like you have one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , zero .\nproject manager: How how ,\nmarketing: Well , we definitely need those .\nproject manager: yeah , how would you leave those out ?\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nuser interface: Well , I don't know , I mean , if you can {gap} like well {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Unless you could say the channel .\nuser interface: I don't know , if there's just a way of leaving them out ?\nindustrial designer: I think people would find that too foreign .\nproject manager: Yeah , that's true .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: And also remember that in this day in age we need , you know , like a hundred button , too .\nmarketing: You definitely need {disfmarker}\nproject manager: I used to have a remote that did not even go up past like fifty . {vocalsound} So I couldn't {disfmarker} whenever I got cable , I had to get a new T_V_ .\nindustrial designer: It's when we get satellite .\nproject manager: Mm . {gap} get your own remote , or digital cable .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nproject manager: 'Kay . Um . I guess , we're gonna discuss the project financing later , making sure that we can fit all of the stuff that we want to on our budget . Um .\nindustrial designer: Yeah , 'cause I don't have any material pricing information available to me at the moment , so {disfmarker}\nproject manager: 'Kay . And don't forget we need to include the colour of our company and the logo .\nuser interface: The colour being yellow ?\nmarketing: Wait .\nproject manager: I'm guessing . And the R_R_ .\nuser interface: And how do we {disfmarker}\nmarketing: I feel like a ye I feel like a yellow one would be too garish .\nindustrial designer: R_ the double R_ .\nproject manager: We could just have the logo in yellow ,\nuser interface: Can't make it entirely {disfmarker}\nproject manager: or maybe a yellow light for the keys .\nindustrial designer: Or is the l\nmarketing: Or put like stripes , oh yeah , yellow lights .\nindustrial designer: Yeah , {vocalsound} yellow could be and it could {disfmarker} doesn't have to be huge .\nuser interface: Well if you have like a {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Yeah .\nuser interface: Hang on . If you have this sort of strip kind of down at the bottom {gap} the base of it , just like yellow with the R_R_ .\nproject manager: Right . So we've simplified , we don't need all those um play , fast-forward , rewind ,\nuser interface: Right , yeah .\nproject manager: or no menu buttons .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: So we've pretty much pared it down to on-off , volume , mute , channel up and down , um the numbers {disfmarker} Yeah . {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Um can we go back to {disfmarker} I'm gonna look really quickly back at those\nuser interface: Two examples .\nproject manager: examples and see if there is anything .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nproject manager: Which one is yours , technical functions or functional requirement ?\nuser interface: Oh , it's a {disfmarker} Yeah .\nproject manager: Okay .\nmarketing: Yeah , audi audio settings and screen settings , we need those like audio settings mono , stereo , pitch , screen settings like brightness , colour , or do we just want that accessed accessed from the television itself ?\nproject manager: The T_V_ . I think that that's fine just for the T_V_ . I mean how often does the average user need to do that kind of stuff ?\nuser interface: Well , the other option is sort of like down at the bottom , like farther away , you just have this sort of box inset where it's like the buttons that you don't use as much , but occasionally you will use .\nproject manager: Hmm .\nuser interface: and so it's like {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Yeah , 'cause we need to {disfmarker} we definitely need to have buttons for like sub-titles and things like that . It's 'cause the foreign film market is expanding and stuff , and like on television like I know f k living in Los Angeles it's tons of Spanish network television if it has English sub-titles it's definitely helpful .\nproject manager: Couldn't we do that all through one button , something , a menu button , that pops up with a menu on the T_V_ that says , you know , audio , video , whatever , language ,\nuser interface: I don't {disfmarker} well , I don't know .\nproject manager: you know ?\nuser interface: Right .\nmarketing: So we need up , down , and side-to-side buttons .\nproject manager: For the menus .\nuser interface: Well , that could be {disfmarker} No you could just double up with like the channel or the volume buttons .\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: That's true .\nuser interface: Channel is just up and down .\nmarketing: Yeah , okay . Okay , yeah .\nuser interface: And then add a {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Something that looks mayb you know .\nmarketing: Such as , yeah , the one the one over there on the left the engineering centred one .\nproject manager: Y right , right right right .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nproject manager: That one ?\nuser interface: So we just have it like {disfmarker} add a menu button then for the various things needed ,\nproject manager: Right .\nuser interface: including v voice recognition if we have any like settings for voice recognition now\nproject manager: In the middle perhaps .\nuser interface: included in the menu .\nproject manager: Yep .\nmarketing: Ooh , I just got an idea for a design .\nproject manager: {gap} good . Anybody have anything else they'd like to bring up in this meeting ?\nindustrial designer: I had something , but I forgot ."}]}
