So , our new project is about {disfmarker} we need design a remote control for television set , so , which has to be original , trendy and user-friendly . I took this off our corporate website . {disfmarker} I think well it sums up what we need to do . It's We're inspired by latest fashion , not only electronics , but also the latest trends in clothes and interior design . That's why our product will always fit in your home . So apparently we need to {vocalsound} um be very at um very open to what's currently hot in the market . So that's what you need to do to bring us the latest info and what people want .\nmarketing: Yeah . Yeah .\nproject manager: So {disfmarker} So we put the fashion in electronics . So that's what we need to go for . Anyway , we'll take this project in three steps , three pha uh three phase of design . First step will be the functional design .\nmarketing: Yeah ."}, {"chapter": 3, "start_ms": 120000, "topic": "Members' acquaintance with the usage of the SMARTboards", "transcript_text": "project manager: And that's basically what we're gonna do . Everybody has uh a piece of individual work and a meeting afterwards , so we can share information about {disfmarker} So I'm gonna keep this short , since we had a technical problem . So skip through this . Uh . Okay . Every meeting we {disfmarker} everybody can present their uh their views and everything , so to help with these , you have {disfmarker} we have the SMARTboards here . We can use a regular PowerPoint presentation . I'm supposed to give you an introduction on this doodling board , so it's {disfmarker} actually it's very easy . Like it says , very simple , you just take out the pen . Like you see here , I'll just take the {disfmarker} take {gap} here . That's it , you just put it on the board . You see a pen here . You go here , just like using a pen . You can just draw whatever you want . It's like the eraser , can erase whatever you want . And so it will be easy just to illustrate your views , if you wanna change the format , you just {vocalsound} either take out jus just like the pen , and whatever you want , your current colour , your line width , just to make the line bigger . So it should be really easy .\nmarketing: Okay .\nproject manager: This is to take the {disfmarker} just take a new slide and back again . We're just gonna keep using this board all the time , so I think it will be {disfmarker} it's very clear for everyone , I suppose . So I'll take this out . {vocalsound} Okay . We'll use that later . Anyway . Yeah , just just just stuff that you wanna share , just put it in the in the project folder , like I put my presentation now . I'll put the the minutes of every meeting , I'll put them there too , so everybody can read up if they have to leave early or whatever . So next , been here . {vocalsound} Well , {gap} gonna give the electronic white-board uh a shot . So basic idea is we have a blank sheet . Just try whatever you want , and like it says , draw your favourite animal . I think the creative genius should go first . {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound} The creative genius ?\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Thank you very much .\nproject manager: So , draw us your favourite animal .\nuser interface: {vocalsound} Well , I'm more into the technical aspects of drawing ,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: so I'm not really good at drawing animals ,\nproject manager: Draw us a technical animal .\nuser interface: but uh the animal which I {gap} {disfmarker} Oh .\nproject manager: Yeah , it's still erasing .\nuser interface: {vocalsound} Pen .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Uh format . Else my animal will be like king-size . I pretty much like {vocalsound} a dolphin , because of its uh its freedom basically . Let's see . A head . {gap} actually worked with this . It's like uh it's a very {disfmarker} Uh high-tech .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Bit low-responsive though .\nproject manager: {vocalsound} So that's what we don't want .\nuser interface: Prefer pen and paper .\nproject manager: We want a high-responsive product . So {disfmarker} It looks more like nuclear bomb .\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Very nice dolphin .\nuser interface: It {vocalsound} {vocalsound} doesn't look like a nuclear bomb .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: This thing isn't doing what I'm {disfmarker} What I want .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Let's go easy on it .\nuser interface: So {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Yeah , well it does look like a nuclear bomb .\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: I'll just finish up real soon , because I'm {disfmarker}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: So it doesn't really look like a dolphin ,\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Anyway ,\nuser interface: but then again , this is all new for me .\nproject manager: it should {disfmarker} It {disfmarker} It's supposed to be a dolphin , you like the freedom that it {disfmarker} that it represents .\nindustrial designer: Uh-huh .\nuser interface: Like the ocean , like swimming . Do that in my spare time , so that's basically an {disfmarker}\nproject manager: What do you like ? Okay . Well ,\nuser interface: Now we can forget this ever happened .\nproject manager: our Marketing Expert .

With a smile on it ,\nproject manager: {vocalsound} It's a cute elephant .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: it's very important .

They are {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: They are really bad , my drawing skills .\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Okay uh-huh .\nproject manager: Sure looks smooth .\nmarketing: Oh .\nindustrial designer: I'm not sure how the legs should go , but {disfmarker}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Uh these are stripes .\nuser interface: Got it . {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I've picked this animal because it's very fast . It is uh it knows exactly what it wants . Uh it hardly ever wastes any resources .\nproject manager: What does it want ?\nindustrial designer: Uh well , basically uh it hunts for prey , but it does it always in a very well-thought way . Uh it knows exactly what it wants . It never kills an animal uh just for the killing , so it's very efficient . And it tries to do everything as fast as possible .\nproject manager: Okay .\nindustrial designer: And it always goes for uh security , in seeking uh uh a hide spot and uh and doing everything ,\nmarketing: Mm .\nindustrial designer: security , speed and efficiency is important . And I think uh those things we can use .\nproject manager: I agree .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Okay .\nproject manager: , I'm supposed to draw the animal next . Yay I introduce to the world the amazing ant .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Uh hard worker .\nproject manager: Great team-workers .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: Do everything to Uh really small , but together they're really strong .

Whatever . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Think it need shoes . So {disfmarker}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound} I'm just too lazy to draw it all black , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound} That's the coolest ant ever .\nuser interface: You've done this before , haven't you ? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I love to draw ants . It's my hobby .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Anyway {disfmarker} Nah . {vocalsound} Just {disfmarker} I think it's very representative what we drew , I guess . Like you take {disfmarker} just take your freedom and use a a trendy interface that you design for us .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: Just {disfmarker} Yeah . You're supposed to make i make it different from uh from what other people have , and just make it a little distinct . Anyway . {gap} another beep to stop the meeting . See . Warning . Finish meeting now . Uh put this down . Examples . Well I guess we have a little little time extra , but {disfmarker} Just a little quick discussion to to open open our work . So what do you guys think about {disfmarker} The first idea is just very short . I'll start with you . What are y What are your first ideas for the new product ?

Well , I was thinking about design remote control , with our uh motto and all .\nmarketing: But {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Uh thing to keep in mind is that we need to stick to what people are familiar with .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nuser interface: No rational changes or whatever , 'cause it {disfmarker} revolutionary changes ,\nproject manager: Okay , so very intuitive design , I guess .\nuser interface: yes . {vocalsound} Uh we might have to consider other design aspects of our product . So that was something I wanted to add ,\nproject manager: {gap}\nuser interface: and perhaps some usability aspect . T_V_ is becoming central in most homes . Do we want people who are disabled in any way to uh , yeah , to be able to use it as well ?\nproject manager: Yeah , we want {disfmarker} I suppose we want almost everyone to be using it . So {vocalsound} I think {disfmarker} I mean , really disabled people , yeah , {vocalsound} might be a problem , but I think it's a little {gap} take it into consideration . Um yeah . I think we really need to cut the meeting short . You have anything you wanna share quickly ?\nindustrial designer: Hmm .\nmarketing: Uh .\nindustrial designer: Only one thing uh that has to be added according to me is uh the the material it is made of , it should be something light .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: That's {disfmarker} it speaks for itself ,\nproject manager: It should be light , okay .\nindustrial designer: but some uh {disfmarker} Yeah .\nproject manager: Um , let's see ,\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: where did I {disfmarker} Let's skip that .
