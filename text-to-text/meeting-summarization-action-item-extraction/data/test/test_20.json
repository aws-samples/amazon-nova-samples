Um , oop . Go back there . Um , another thing I think we d missed out on on the last meeting was the fact that we should consider the environmental impact of our design . Um , from previous researches I've carried out on other projects , um we've learnt about smart materials where um um specific alloys of metals have a shape memory .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: So they can be heated and um and cooled , and they change the shape of um the metal . So , for example , a screw that's holding something together could expand and it would force all the components apart . So um , the benefits of this for our product would be that when it came to the end of its product life , if it was heated , um everything would spring apart . So , all the um individual components could be easily separated , and then some could be reused , some could be recycled , and I think that would be very important for products now . Especially 'cause there's much uh responsibility for all the um companies who are coming up with like new designs . 'Cause all , we all know that our resources are being limited , and we have to be very environmentally conscious .\nproject manager: Right , um , one question . This , um , self-destructible uh metal , it allows for recycling materials ?\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nproject manager: So that , um , someone could have this product for as long as they felt that they wanted it , and then once they contribute it , then that company can break down the part , the parts better ?\nindustrial designer: Um {disfmarker} And then {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah they would , um you would make the , the product as you normally would , apart from the , the bits that hold it all together would be made out of this shape-memory alloy . And that's the part that would um allow all the other parts to be separated at the end . I mean , the user would return the p product to the company , 'cause it's the product's responsibility to get rid of what they've made . Um , and then the company could then just use , make use of this shape-memory alloys to split up the components ,\nproject manager: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: and then either reuse some bits , and other bits which are obviously gonna wear out with time , or not usable , they might be like be able to put into scrap metal . Something like the case , if it's scratched or something , you would want to reuse it , but you might be able to melt it down and reuse it again somewhere else .\nproject manager: Mm-hmm . Would we be the company that would break down these , or uh metals ? Or would we contribute to another group ?\nindustrial designer: You could {disfmarker} we could probably empl em employ a , a side company or something to do that for us . But it would be our responsibility to get that done and to dispose of the products that we made . For a certain percentage at least .\nproject manager: Alright .\nindustrial designer: Not every , not a hundred percent of everything we produce ,\nproject manager: Okay . This sounds like a really great idea .\nindustrial designer: but {disfmarker}\nproject manager: One thing we have to consider is our uh one hundred percent um turnover goal that we have for our financial sector .\nindustrial designer: Yeah . Yeah .\nproject manager: Um , so we'll have to investigate how much that will cost us , cost the company ,\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nproject manager: um 'cause it sounds very labour-intensive . You would have to hire a number of people , and it might be more expensive .\nindustrial designer: Well I {disfmarker} the fact of the shape-memory alloys is that they , they don't need to be manually de um deconstructed . Like , you don't have to individually um unscrew all the screws . Because of this , their properties are smart material .\nproject manager: Mm-hmm .\nindustrial designer: All you need is just the heat , so they self-destruct themselves .\nproject manager: Alright . We'll still have to investigate the financial implications .\nindustrial designer: So I suppose it does need like high contact , yeah , you know high uh quality machinery , and very specific machinery , but {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Alright . I like the environmental approach . Um , we'll have to see if that can meet our financial goals as well .\nindustrial designer: Yeah . Okay . Um also there is um components . This'll be how it uh will actually work . But I haven't put this plan together yet .\nproject manager: I'm sorry , could you {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: There we go\nproject manager: Those were um {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: . Sorry , should I go back . This would actually show the circuit diagram . Although I haven't come up with the final circuit yet .\nproject manager: Okay .\nindustrial designer: So I just {gap} put all those components in .\nproject manager: So those are what , um , we'll c construct the remote . Those are all the {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: Yeah . I it just shows what sort of energy source . It could be a battery , like rechargeable probably . Um , an' yeah , well how the infrared will actually be sent through the chip to be received by the chip on the television set itself .\nproject manager: Alright . Great .\nindustrial designer: Okay ?

I'm the User {vocalsound} um User Interface Designer . Uh , the technical functions design of the apparatus is the effect the apparatus should have . Um , in this case it's the function of the remote control , which is to send messages to the television , television set . By taking inspiration from other similar designs , we'll try and come up with an original trendy remote control , which is sellable international . There're two functional design options . A multifunctional remote control , which can be used for several entertainment devices . And a single function remote control , used specifically for the television . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I'm sorry , what was that last one . Multifunctional and {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Sorry . Um , a single function just for the television itself .\nmarketing: Ch Oh , I see .\nuser interface: Yeah . Um , multifunctional controls can be difficult to use , as the multitude of buttons can be confusing . A single function remote control is simpler to use , but it means you have to have other remote controls for your other entertainment devices .\nmarketing: 'Kay .\nuser interface: Um , I think that a single function remote control would be preferable , because it's easier to use . It'd be more compatible with a range of television sets , making it more internationally sellable . Um , it will make an original design more obtainable , as we have less functional necessities to include in the design . And it would be more profitable as it would be more simplistic . And less functions would have to be included . So it would be cheaper to make . And probably more sellable just because it's more compatible with a r a wider range of devices . Does anyone have any questions ? {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound} So as far as we know , um , a single function television remote control is us usable internationally ?\nuser interface: Well , it's just that , when we're creating it , we're , we have to make it um compatible with different brands of devices .\nmarketing: {gap} Right .\nuser interface: And it would be easier to make it compatible with just different brands of television devices rather than other ent ,\nmarketing: D_V_D_s and V_C_R_ ?\nuser interface: yeah ,\nproject manager: Right .\nmarketing: Okay .\nuser interface: other entertainment devices .\nproject manager: Does everyone agree with this ? Does anyone object and , and find the multifunctional might be a better way to go ?\nindustrial designer: Um , {vocalsound} I was just wondering about the , what , what Genevieve said before , about having like some hidden controls like having the outer casing . And that would probably , um , I d , well well what you said before about it being a more profitable simplistic design . I suppose having that would complicate it a lot more .\nuser interface: Yeah . Yeah .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} And limit the design {gap} . Do you think ?\nmarketing: Yeah , I think I agree with the single design thing for now , because we're trying to do so much , that if we're trying to make a unique , user-friendly , dadada , and it's also multi also multifunctional , um , we're gonna go over budget for one thing .\nindustrial designer: Yeah . Yeah . That's true . Yeah .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nmarketing: So {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Mm-hmm .\nuser interface: Yeah . And with this we'll have more room in the budget probably to make a more original design .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nuser interface: We'll have more money to go into the design side of it .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Okay . Yeah .\nproject manager: Alright . Sounds great .\nmarketing: Mm , 'kay .\nproject manager: Alright , well , um ,"}, {"chapter": 3, "start_ms": 744000, "topic": "The specific functional requirements of this remote control", "transcript_text": "marketing: Okay . So I'll be discussing the functional requirements of this remote control . Um , and I'll give you a little briefing on what that means exactly . Um , if you all remember from the email we got before our very first uh kick-off meeting , with the coffee machine ? The functional requirements of that was to produce hot coffee quickly . Um , so what I'll be talking about now is the equivalent for a remote control . Um , so basically what needs and desires are to be fulfilled . Um , I've done some marketing research , a lot of interviews with remote control users , um , and some internet research . And I'll show you my findings . Oh , and firstly I wanted to remind you about our company motto and purpose . So we believe in providing international market with fashionable products . Um , hence our motto , we put the fashion in electronics . So I think that should be our priority here . Um , and we should also be looking to trends in clothing and interior design . Not just in electronic fashion . So that it's something that fits in the household .\nproject manager: I'm sorry , what was that last thing that you just said ?\nmarketing: Um , we should be looking towards trends in both clothing and interior design .\nproject manager: Mm-hmm .\nmarketing: Any trends that are going on in , in the public , even media ,\nindustrial designer: Mm .\nmarketing: you know who's famous , what T_V_ shows are being watched ,\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nmarketing: um , to influence our remote control . Okay , so the findings . Um , seventy five percent of users of remote controls find them ugly . Which is a , quite a significant number .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Um , the other twenty five percent didn't specify if they love them or found them , you know , neutral . Eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . Current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user .\nproject manager: I'm sorry , that eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . You mean that they would spend more money on a fancy-looking remote control ?\nmarketing: Yeah , they're willing , they're willing to spend money on a remote control with personality .\nproject manager: Okay .\nmarketing: As opposed to your basic , you know , oval black , all same size button remote control .\nindustrial designer: Mm . Yeah .\nmarketing: Um , so it is something that people care about . It's not , it's not ignored in the household . Um , seventy five percent of remote control users said that they zap a lot . Zapping meaning they go through channels a lot .\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm .\nmarketing: They're you know thumb-masters . Um , and fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons . That A very small amount . Thought that was interesting .\nproject manager: Alright , so it might be very appealing if , um , we have very concise buttons .\nindustrial designer: Mm . {gap} the single function .\nproject manager: And another thing with um lots of surfing , we'd probably have to work on something that could be um a lot more durable ,\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nproject manager: because I find with um channel-changers that , um , a lot of the numbers get rubbed down if they're printed on the button .\nmarketing: Yes .\nindustrial designer: Yeah that's a good point .\nuser interface: Yeah . Yeah .\nmarketing: And actually to go with that , I'm gonna give you some statistics on the uh relevancy of the buttons , how much they're used . And uh how important the uh users find them . So the power button , obviously , in an hour is only used once . Hopefully the person's not turning on and off the T_V_ . Um , but the relevance of that button is nine out of ten . So people wanna be able to turn on the T_V_ with the remote control . Um , as opposed to standing up and turning on the television set . Channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times on average per hour .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: That's a huge amount . This is the most important button . Um , so obviously when commercials come on they're changing it , so as you said we want a durable button that's not gonna run down . Relevance of that button , our users found was uh ten , ten out of ten . Uh , ditto for volume selection , so ten out of ten . And it's used on average four times an hour . Not as much as channel selection , but still significant . Um , audio settings is used on average zero point eight times an hour . Relevance is two . Screen settings , which means brightness , colour etcetera , zero point five times an hour . Um , and relevance of one point five . We're getting to specific statistics here . Teletext , um , now I'm not too clear on what that is . I don't know if you can help me . Flipping pages .\nuser interface: It's um {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Is that {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: It's like the news . Or like information .\nuser interface: It has {disfmarker} T_V_ has like information , it has information on holidays , the news , entertainment .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: The {disfmarker}\nproject manager: It's um {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: and what's on .\nmarketing: So like a running banner , underneath {disfmarker}\nproject manager: No it's a button that you press , and then you , uh , like a menu pops up .\nuser interface: No , li Yeah .\nproject manager: I haven't used it before\nuser interface: Yeah .\nproject manager: but {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Oh .\nindustrial designer: It's like {disfmarker}\nuser interface: And you have page numbers like for the menu , and you press the page numbers with your remote , and it , it'll come up .\nindustrial designer: It's like very basic internet . Sort of ,\nmarketing: Okay .\nuser interface: Very basic internet , yeah .\nindustrial designer: um {disfmarker}\nuser interface: But you have {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Okay . Like tells you the weather , and {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Yeah . But you have no interaction back with it , you know .\nmarketing: Okay .\nuser interface: Like the internet you can send emails and {disfmarker} You've no interaction .\nindustrial designer: Yeah , it's just information that um , like television timetables , what's on , what's on now , what's on next , on every channel , and {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Right .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nmarketing: Alright . Well I guess I'm not with it , because I wasn't {disfmarker} But it's , it's being used fourteen times an hour . Um , and has a r a high relevance of six point five . So it looks like something that we're gonna want to do some research on and include on our remote control .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nmarketing: Um , channel settings . Zero point zero one times an hour . Relevance of three . Channel settings .\nuser interface: Uh , probably just tuning in the channels , would it be ?\nmarketing: P Sorry . Changing the channels ?\nuser interface: Tuning them in at the very start . You know if you get a new T_V_ set , you tune in all the channels ,\nindustrial designer: To get the right reception and picture , I suppose .\nuser interface: do you th do you think ?\nmarketing: Oh , okay .\nuser interface: Yeah . Yeah .\nmarketing: Yeah . Okay .\nproject manager: Mm .\nmarketing: Um , so it's not used very often , but people still find it relevant . Okay . Um , biggest frustrations of uh the people that we interviewed . Remote controls are often lost somewhere . So that was already discussed by Poppy . How we could have a , an alarm system so that people can find it . Um , takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control .\nindustrial designer: {gap}\nmarketing: So it should be very user-friendly , you know . People know what to do very quickly . Um , remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ . {vocalsound} {gap}\nindustrial designer: Repetitive strain injury .\nuser interface: Repeti Uh .\nmarketing: Ah .\nindustrial designer: I think .\nmarketing: Is that what it is ? People with arthritis and such ?\nproject manager: That's rather sad . {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Um , maybe our\nindustrial designer: Oh , I'm guessing that's what it is . I'm not {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah , yeah . I think it is .\nmarketing: designers can look into that . Um , buttons that don't require , you know , very firm pushing , if they respond .\nindustrial designer: Mm . Yeah .\nmarketing: But we'll have to also avoid , you know , buttons responding to the slightest touch as well . That's a problem .\nindustrial designer: Yeah . It is .\nmarketing: Okay . Did you guys uh get that one down ?\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: Yep .\nmarketing: Um {vocalsound} okay , here's some ideas for you . A large percentage of the public would pay for voice recognition on the remote controls . So I'll show you some numbers here . Um , so the youngest age group , fifteen to twenty five . Ninety one point two percent said that they would pay extra money to have voice recogni voice recognition included on their remote control . Um , and you can see that number decreases a bit with ol s Interestingly enough , twenty five to thirty five is the lowest amount . Um , that would , are willing to pay extra . So I guess we're gonna have to figure out what age group we're , we're targeting , and if and if voice recognition is something we wanna look into . And if we have the budget for it . Um , if we are targeting young adults , it looks like something that would pay off . Seeing as ninety percent , over ninety percent would pay for it .\nproject manager: I agree with um {disfmarker} if we're targeting young adults then it would be something we should look into . Um , financially and and functionally .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: Um , and especially if we are um trying to be trendy , go with fashions , things like that .\nindustrial designer: Mm .\nproject manager: Um , ages like from thirty five to sixty five which show lower numbers probably won't be as concerned .\nmarketing: So that , that's a whole other field of research . I don't know if it'd be , if we'd still have a remote , or if you're talking to your television and saying change channel .\nproject manager: Mm-hmm .\nmarketing: Um and depending on how many members you have in households .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nmarketing: So it m it may be too complicated for us , but it's something to keep in mind anyway .\nproject manager: Yeah . And something that might further complicate it is that the T_V_ makes noise itself .\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Right .\nproject manager: Wonder if it would have {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: And if there was conversation in the room at the same time ,\nproject manager: Yeah .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nindustrial designer: although in theory it doesn't tend to be when you're watching television ,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: but {vocalsound} {gap} could be very difficult to get the specific uh design .\nproject manager: {gap} Yeah . If we're looking for a simplistic design , if {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: We need to decide if that is our um intention is , is a simplistic design .\nindustrial designer: Yeah . Mm .\nproject manager: Um , because if , if it is then I think voice , um voice-activated {disfmarker}\nmarketing: It looks like {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Yeah , and that would sort of negate the whole remote control thing ,\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: because if people can activate the television with their voice then they won't be using a , they won't be talking into a remote , I'm sure .\nmarketing: It'd be like the ultimate remote . {gap} Um {vocalsound} okay . And th the last thing here was a , an L_C_D_ screen . So , I mean voice recognition might be a little too extreme for us . Not practical . Um an L_C_D_ screen though might be something that , you know , you can shift through pages kind of li the way this PowerPoint is working .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nmarketing: So that you don't have so many buttons to deal with .\nproject manager: Um , I don't know what an L_C_D_ screen is .\nmarketing: Oh sorry , just , just a screen , like a computer screen . S Or like um {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Mobile phone .\nindustrial designer: Mm .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nmarketing: Yeah . Or {disfmarker} Like an alarm clock . You'd have an L_C_D_ versus just a , a normal clock .\nindustrial designer: What , what would appear on the screen ?\nproject manager: I have no idea still . {vocalsound} I'm sorry . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Oh just like an electronic screen . As opposed to just buttons . There would be like a little , like on {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Oh , on the remote . Okay .\nmarketing: Yeah . Like on the top of a cellphone , the the little L_C_D_ screen .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nmarketing: Um , now that's , I , I dunno exactly what exactly we'd put on there . I guess the channel that you're on , the v the volume setting .\nuser interface: Yeah . Could it it {disfmarker} It would be good if it had the actual programme that was on , and what was next . But that would probably be {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: Like linked in with the teletext ,\nuser interface: Yeah . That would be good , yeah .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nindustrial designer: or sort of like an teletext at your fingers , without having to access that through the television .\nuser interface: Yeah . Might be quite expensive to do that though .\nindustrial designer: Mm , Yeah . Could be . {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Well I guess that's something we can all take back to our respective research .\nproject manager: Right .\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm .\nmarketing: Um , and finally , whoops , my personal preferences and thoughts . Um , I think our priority really should be unique design . Um , we want something that people want in their home . Every remote control looks the same , so uh in my opinion it should be , um , user-friendly and unique . So the other stuff might be a little too , a little too gadgety for some people .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nmarketing: Um , I th myself , voice recognition kind of scares me off .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: So if we're , if we're aiming to make this an international university , universally accepted product {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: Mm .\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Um , and for all , the other thing is like age market . I mean if we wanted to concentrate on fifteen to twenty five years olds , we could go for the fancy stuff . But if we wanna make fifty million , and and have everyone want this remote control , we should maybe stick to the basics .\nproject manager: Mm-hmm .\nuser interface: And we should keep in mind that fifteen to twenty five year olds might not have twenty five Euros to spend on a remote control . Like their priorities might not be a fancy remote control , when they're just starting out\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nuser interface: and , yeah .\nmarketing: Right . And we have to keep in mind the , the reliability of our research . I mean , you know , a sixteen year old boy would say , yeah I'd pay extra for voice recognition , until they realise that's three months allowance .\nuser interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound} Yeah . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Um , so I I think , I think the older generations we should be catering to a bit more .\nuser interface: Early twenties , that's the kind of age group .\nproject manager: Yeah . And if one of the largest , uh , or most complained about thing is that it takes so long to get to know how to use a remote control ,\nuser interface: Twenties .\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nproject manager: I'm sure that something like an L_C_D_ screen or remote control would be just furthering that problem .\nindustrial designer: Yeah . Complicated jus complicating things even fo Mm .\nmarketing: Yep .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nproject manager: Alright .\nindustrial designer: Okay .\nmarketing: Okay . That's it for the market research ."}, {"chapter": 4, "start_ms": 1944000, "topic": "Finalization on the product plan", "transcript_text": "project manager: Alright , and another thing . This is for the design , the design of the product is that um we wanna create , um more of a sense that people know that this is from our company . So , um , all the remote controls must have our um {disfmarker} We'll incorporate our logo and colour in in some way .\nindustrial designer: Right . Yeah .\nproject manager: So , um , perhaps um our logo on the bottom , or wherever you feel like it would look good .\nindustrial designer: Yeah . Okay .\nproject manager: Um , it doesn't have to be the colour of our um of our company\nindustrial designer: Just {disfmarker}\nproject manager: but , another thing is that , um\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: we need to , we probably would have to have that colour and , and logo decided upon . Um , I'm assuming that we already have one , but for the purposes of this meeting I , I wasn't offered a , like a type of logo or colour , so if that could be um somewhere on the design so that we can be recognisable .\nindustrial designer: Okay . Work on that .\nmarketing: It's probably R_ R_R_ in yellow . {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nproject manager: The little R_ R_ yellow thing ? Okay .\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nmarketing: Yeah , I think .\nproject manager: Real Reaction ? Okay . Um , yes , those are the changes . Um , so , now we need to discuss , um and come to a decision on our remote control functions , of , of how this is going to be . I'm just going to look at my notes for a second . Um , we have to decide on a target group and the functions of the remote control . So , um , we already know that it'll just be for the television .\nindustrial designer: Okay .\nproject manager: It'll {disfmarker} It won't have teletext . But um , you know , we could discuss um those other options that you brought up , Genevieve .\nindustrial designer: {gap}\nmarketing: Okay , so I {disfmarker} Are we going to write off the L_C_D_ option ?\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nproject manager: Is that how most people feel about that ?\nuser interface: Yeah .\nmarketing: Yeah ?\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nproject manager: Okay .\nmarketing: Okay . So no L_C_D_ , no teletext , and no voice recognition .\nuser interface: I think it would be annoying though if {disfmarker} I don't use teletext that much , but if it was on your T_V_ , you'd want to be able to use it , if {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Yeah , but another thing is that if we're reaching an international crowd , um , I know for one that in North America there is no such thing as teletext , so it'd be really superfluous .\nuser interface: You'd {disfmarker} Yeah .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nuser interface: So is it just {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nmarketing: Never heard of it .\nuser interface: Okay . Alright .\nproject manager: Yeah . I don't know about other countries besides the U_K_ .\nuser interface: Right .\nproject manager: Do you know if anywhere else has it ?\nindustrial designer: I don't know .\nuser interface: I don't know .\nindustrial designer: More research required , I think .\nuser interface: I don't know . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Alright .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} But if {disfmarker} Was it a management decision that we're having {disfmarker}\nproject manager: It was a management decision ,\nindustrial designer: Okay .\nproject manager: so it's , it's pretty much out of our hands at this point .\nindustrial designer: So {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Okay .\nuser interface: Okay then .\nproject manager: 'Kay .

The same signalling .\nproject manager: the same signal through that and it could just like make a little beeping noise .\nindustrial designer: I mean {disfmarker}\nproject manager: It's not that expensive to do .\nindustrial designer: Or vibrate just the same as a mobile phone .

Then it wouldn't , it probably wouldn't be able to use {disfmarker} It would be able to use the same reception on the remote c control I guess , but the actual device would have to have its own infrared signaller .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nproject manager: Okay .\nindustrial designer: Yeah , okay .\nuser interface: Would it need a battery then ?\nproject manager: Maybe , um {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: Pr probably .\nproject manager: Probably , I mean .\nindustrial designer: Unless it could be {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nproject manager: That's your department you'll have to sort that out .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Mm .\nindustrial designer: Okay . Um , unless some way , it could have some universal connection to like the socket , the same socket that the T_V_'s supplied from . I mean the power for the T_V_ .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nproject manager: Yeah , you'll have to {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: So , mm , more research into that one .\nproject manager: Yeah , you'll have to investi Do some research on that ,\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nmarketing: Mm .\nproject manager: alright ? Great . Um , alright , and I'm sure that , um um , the glow-in-the-dark , fluorescent , whatever , system , um is a go ahead .

I think that would be better .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nuser interface: 'Cause you know the way fluorescent lights lose their brightness after certain time , so\nindustrial designer: Yeah . Yeah .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nmarketing: {gap} it doesn't {disfmarker}\nuser interface: I would go for {disfmarker}\nmarketing: It could it could be a tactile thing as well . Um right , if w if we're minimising buttons , we might be able to make them actually larger . And there's something on it . S you know like up arrow down arrow for , for volume .\nindustrial designer: Like a raised {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Um , and I don't know what we could do for , for channels . S\nuser interface: Well just the numbers could be embossed , couldn't it ? Like raised .\nmarketing: The numbers themselves .\nuser interface: Yeah . Could be raised .\nmarketing: But then the like up button and down button for the channel , channel changing .\nuser interface: Just little arrows , that you could feel , maybe ?\nindustrial designer: Yeah {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: Hmm .\nmarketing: I just thought that {gap} it , it might be sucking more battery power , if there , if it is a light up . I'm not sure .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: That's true .\nproject manager: But I mean {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: And also y , uh Heather you mentioned before , um like how it should be accessible to everybody .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Um , so like big b um buttons , {gap} for people you are visually impaired . The glow-in-the-dark or light up won't make any difference anyway .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nindustrial designer: So like you say tactile might be better , because it'd be more available to everybody .\nuser interface: That , I think that's good , yeah .\nproject manager: Yeah . Could we somehow {disfmarker} We could , may , possibly , sorry , incorporate them both so that the buttons could maybe be in the shape of the numbers themselves and be made out of some glow-in-the-dark material .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nuser interface: Yeah . Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: 'Cause I d I don't think that glow-in-the-dark material , um , like the actual soft plastic , um , costs that much more than other colours .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nindustrial designer: No , it's not these days .\nuser interface: No , I wouldn't say so .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I mean , it's quite easily accessible .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nmarketing: I guess the other option , referring to the battery thing is , you know how cellphones will t light up for fifteen seconds or something , when you're s and then it goes ,\nindustrial designer: Yeah . Yeah .\nuser interface: That's good {disfmarker} Yeah that a good idea .\nmarketing: so if , if you're like changing the volume during a movie . I know , I'm thinking of mostly when you're watching a movie you turn all the lights off right .\nindustrial designer: Yeah . Yeah .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nmarketing: And you don't want to turn on the lights , {vocalsound} to turn it down , because there's suddenly an explosion , and it's gonna wake up the baby .\nuser interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nmarketing: Um , so if you touch the button , it kind of reactivates it .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nmarketing: It lights up for {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nuser interface: That , yeah , that's a good idea .\nmarketing: On self timer .\nindustrial designer: So self-timed lighting .\nproject manager: Alright we have five minutes left\nmarketing: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Um , I {disfmarker}\nproject manager: um , for the meeting , but I think we should discuss this light subject a little bit more before we close . Um , what was {disfmarker} I missed the last moment , reading that . What were you talking about with the lighting up buttons ?\nmarketing: Oh , just if it was kinda the same way that a cell You know how a cellphone will light up for about ten , fifteen seconds when you touch a button , after having not touched it for a while .\nproject manager: Yeah . Yeah .\nmarketing: Um , if instead of a constant light up on the , on the remote control , if it lights up for ten seconds when it's touched again .\nproject manager: Mm . So it could be any button that would be pressed .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nmarketing: Yeah , and you , you touch it and it just kind of lights up a bit , and it gives a faint glow .\nindustrial designer: So , self-timed {disfmarker}\nmarketing: So if you have all the lights off in your living room , you'll , you'll temporarily see it .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nmarketing: Because usually you're not fooling around for it for more than what ten seconds .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nproject manager: Okay , so {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Yeah .\nmarketing: So {disfmarker}\nproject manager: That's probably feasible .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nproject manager: So , do you think that we should do the lighting up thing , and the glow-in-the-dark thing , and the shape of the numbers ? Do we have to kind of decide what we're gonna do with this .\nindustrial designer: I think the shape of the numbers is a really good idea .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: Yeah , okay .\nindustrial designer: And I think that's un unique as well .\nuser interface: Yeah . For visually impaired , yeah .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: I mean , I haven't seen that . And as you're saying like numbers can wear off if they're just sort of like painted on , you know printed .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: Yeah , yeah . And it could {gap} , if it's that softer rubber material it'll be , maybe , um , uh , better for people with um els no\nindustrial designer: {gap} durable .\nproject manager: what's it called , R_S_I_ , what was it that we were talking about ?\nindustrial designer: Oh yeah . Yeah . Yeah .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nmarketing: Oh right , the {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Yeah instead of like hard buttons .\nindustrial designer: Repetitive strain injury .\nproject manager: Okay . Um , did we want to go for the glow-in-the-dark look ?\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: Or did we want to go for the lighting up instantly ?\nuser interface: If {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Like should we do both ? Or we can have one or the other ? Because it might , for , for our design purposes , I mean , the lighting up thing might be better because glow-in-the-dark material has a funny kinda colour .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: And it might not go with different like face plates that we might come up with .\nmarketing: I was gonna say , {gap}\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nmarketing: Exactly . It the {disfmarker} it might be perceived as tacky , glow-in-the-dark .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nmarketing: It's kind of like Eighties neon-style .\nindustrial designer: Yeah , and we could {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Um , whereas we're trying to be trendy and fashionable .\nindustrial designer: Yeah there are now like loads , or a huge range of different colours that it could light up in as well ,\nmarketing: So {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: which could like link in with the company colours . Like it could be blue or green or yellow ,\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Right .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nindustrial designer: or like we've just limited t with the , just ordinary phosphorescent so {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Right . Alright . So we've decided on lighting up things .\nuser interface: I was thinking though , if it was glow-in-the-dark , you could put the um Real Reaction symbol as glow-in-the-dark , and then it would be constantly advertised .\nindustrial designer: Yeah . Every time the , that it lit up , you c that could light up as well .\nmarketing: Mm .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Or , or the , whate\nproject manager: Yeah .\nuser interface: {gap} Yeah .\nproject manager: But with the same thing , I mean . If you touch the button and then it could be , it could be lit up as well .\nmarketing: That's true .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nuser interface: Yeah . Okay .\nproject manager: Is {disfmarker} Are you okay with that ? Okay . Cool .\nuser interface: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Um {disfmarker} Alright . So I think that um that completes most of our um our more uh practical decisions .\nindustrial designer: Is {disfmarker}\nproject manager: And now it's up to designing . And um making sure that this can be feasible . And do you have anything {disfmarker}\nmarketing: What um {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Do you have anything to say ? {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Oh sorry . Yeah well , I was just gonna throw out there the thought about um personalising the remote control . Um , it , you , 'cause you mentioned face plates . So I I dunno if there's something that diff , you know like five different face plates . I dunno if this will start making it more complicated , but it could increase the popularity of the , of the remote . Um\nindustrial designer: Okay . Like you can have changeable um mobile covers or something .\nuser interface: Oh yeah . Interchangeable thing ?\nmarketing: Yeah , {gap} {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Like an iPod or something ?\nuser interface: That would be good .\nindustrial designer: Yeah , or {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Exactly , like an iPod .\nproject manager: Okay .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nmarketing: Exactly .\nindustrial designer: Okay .\nmarketing: Or , or like mobile ph .\nproject manager: Like a cellphone ? Yeah .\nmarketing: And I dunno if we'd want to go with like T_V_ show themes or something . Like a Bart Simpson faceplate .\nuser interface: Yeah , and then that would be uh more profitable like as a sideline to the remote as well .\nmarketing: {vocalsound} But {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: {gap} Yeah .\nproject manager: Mm-hmm .\nuser interface: Y Could buy extra {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: Accessories .\nmarketing: Exactly . You could start out with three , and if , if we hit it big then we can add some on .\nindustrial designer: Person {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Yeah . Well , that's great .\nuser interface: That's a good idea . Yeah .\nproject manager: Yeah . I think that we should incorporate that .\nindustrial designer: Interchangeable .\nproject manager: 'Cause that wouldn't be very expensive at all .\nindustrial designer: Um , als\nproject manager: You'd just get one mould ,\nuser interface: No .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: throw some plastic in it , you know . {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Interchan And also possible {disfmarker} I mean , uh , we could gain out of that by advertising certain T_V_ shows , or {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Yeah . Well , that might be com problematic with um copyright issues .\nuser interface: Oh yeah .\nmarketing: Right .\nproject manager: So , if it takes off then we'll , we'll , we'll try that out .\nindustrial designer: Yeah . But if we , there is {disfmarker}\nuser interface: If w\nindustrial designer: Yeah . We could {disfmarker} Um , the environmental factor , we didn't bring that up again .\nproject manager: Right .\nmarketing: Right .\nproject manager: We'll have to do more research . Like as of yet , that has nothing to do with , um , the way it'll look . Um , does it need to be reached a de\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nproject manager: Do we need to reach a decision on that right now ?\nindustrial designer: Um , I've {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Because we need to investigate the financial implications .\nindustrial designer: Okay .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay . Is it {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: Let's {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Does it need to be uh decided on now ? Or should we {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: I think we could probably leave that 'til later on , then .\nproject manager: Okay . Good . Alright then . Anyone else have anything more to say before we close ?\nuser interface: No .\nindustrial designer: No .\nproject manager: Alright , well . Let's have lunch and we'll discuss this later .\nuser interface: {vocalsound} Okay .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Alright ?\nindustrial designer: Okay . Thank you ."}]}
