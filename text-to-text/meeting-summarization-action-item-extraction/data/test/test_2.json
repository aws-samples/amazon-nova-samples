'Kay . Sorry about the small delay . Falling a little bit behind schedule . And that's uh fifteen twenty five . Okay . So just to try and roughly go over what we agreed in the last one , um we're gonna go for something uh uh how was it ? Uh The new black , I believe .\nmarketing: {gap} .\nproject manager: Um something that looks good 'cause that seems to be in preference to actual functionality in the end , though we should never avoid functionality , of course . Uh many of our components are gonna be standard , off the shelf , but it seemed like we were gonna require at least an advanced chip and we were still very much for the idea of using an L_C_D_ display . Um other things were we were hoping to use rubber , most likely gonna be double curved , etcetera . Okay . So um due to your hard work , we might as well let the uh two designers go first , and uh show us the prototype .\nuser interface: Okay , it's a {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Quite how the best way to do this is , I'm not sure ,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {gap} I think if we both step up\nproject manager: but {disfmarker}\nuser interface: and uh outline our ideas . Okay . Now do {disfmarker} uh doing the prototype gave us a bit more insight into the ergonomics of the design . Um for one thing , it turned out that the only point at which it needs to be articulated for handedness is um is h i is down here for the uh L_E_D_ . As it turned out , the whole thing transfers from the right to left hand fairly well from the point of view of operating the uh function buttons and joystick , though it might be an idea to be able to a adjust the positions for the base of the joystick just a little bit for uh {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Okay .\nuser interface: {gap} ju just a thought . You could simply have a slightly ovoid shaped joystick that could then just be turn uh twisted round , so that the uh sticky uh so that the bit that sticks out a bit more is on one side or the other . But as you as you see with the uh {vocalsound} with holding it in the left hand , the L_ uh the L_C_D_ is nowhere useful , so that would need to be articulated uh if we're going to retain {gap} ergonomic design . Um now I I got your note about uh keeping the cost down .\nproject manager: I'm afraid yeah .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nproject manager: We'll go into that a bit more ,\nuser interface: {gap} this design could be done with um with uh plastic casing .\nproject manager: but please go on .\nuser interface: Though I would recommend around the grip part here in the middle , having maybe just a rubber grip over that which would allow for a slightly more sort of bio-morphic form , and a bit more ergonomic as well . As for the um as for the single curve , um well this edge and this edge , like I say it would be nice to have some curvature to it , but it's not absolutely necessary . Really the curve that's most needed is the underside so that the jo so that the joystick rests over the the edge of the hand like this . Um and you have the uh transmitter here and a wee speaker for the uh for the uh for the uh fi uh for the remote control finder . So .\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Any further comments ?\nindustrial designer: Um obviously it's gonna be bulkier than how it looks , because it's gonna be flat on one side , so the L_C_D_ will be s sticking down like this , won't it ?\nuser interface: Mm-hmm . Yeah .\nindustrial designer: 'Cause it {disfmarker} you can't get it curved .\nuser interface: Yeah , I mean the\nindustrial designer: Uh because of costs .\nuser interface: uh {disfmarker} Yeah .\nindustrial designer: And it's plastic as well , so it won't be as comfortable on the hand .\nuser interface: Yeah . I mean with the with the rubber design it could i you know it could pretty much mould very much to the to the user's hand .\nproject manager: Mm .\nuser interface: One nice wee feature if we could if we could still do the rubber , I though of was to have {gap} the uh rubber extend beyond the end of the uh {vocalsound} of the rigid substructure . So it has a wee sort of tail that you just drape over your wrist so it stays in position nicely .\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Mm . Lovely . Um .\nindustrial designer: Yeah , {gap} . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay , yeah . Great . Um .\nmarketing: Right . Yeah I've got a {disfmarker} if you load up my evaluation document .\nproject manager: Yeah , okay {gap} .\nuser interface: Okay .\nproject manager: Excellent work .\nmarketing: Mm .\nproject manager: Um ."}, {"chapter": 2, "start_ms": 234000, "topic": "Budget balancing", "transcript_text": "marketing: Uh evaluation . {vocalsound} Basic point uh have a list of criteria that we need to rate the prototype by . {vocalsound} Um then we will {disfmarker} it's a seven s um seven seven step kinda evaluation process . So um not seven steps , seven scale . So after we've finished doing all the ratings for each criteria , we average that and that will give us some type of uh confidence in our prototype . And uh the criteria {gap} based on Real Reactions' kinda goals and policies , marketing strategies , and also those I put together from the user requirements phase . 'Kay . Um if you flip the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} So , those are the criteria . And uh perhaps I could have put 'em a bit better , but you notice a few things that we've totally abandoned , which means {vocalsound} that uh the product will score very badly on some of those points .\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Put it mildly . So we have um true ? One , t Seven , eight , oh . Fourth . Okay , so we have to go through each point . If we imagine it's actually straight , and just give it a a score . So um how well would you say the prototype is uh how well have we realised the dream of being able to stop remotes from from being lost , or to be able to find them once they are lost . I mean , uh is the homing thing still {disfmarker} the locator , is that still {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Yeah , that's still part of the design .\nmarketing: Sure . And Adam , we can keep that in ?\nproject manager: Yeah , I believe so . So I mean I don't think anybody could actually stop a remote being lost ,\nmarketing: Okay .\nproject manager: 'cause that would mean doing something about the human element ,\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Sure .\nproject manager: but I'd like to think that we've done something about finding the damn thing once we have .\nmarketing: T\nuser interface: Mm . Mm . And making it a bright colour helps\nmarketing: Sure .\nuser interface: with the {disfmarker} personally I would have gone for purple {gap} . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Mm . Bright colour . So we still have that noise thing , yeah ?\nuser interface: Mm-hmm .\nmarketing: Os on a scale of one to seven , how would you guys rate it for finding {gap} finding it once it's lost ?\nuser interface: I'd say number one .\nmarketing: Number one ?\nindustrial designer: One . Yeah . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Okay . Number number one for the first criteria .\nuser interface: I think w if it was just the sounder then th {gap} I mean something I've found with uh w w with say tr trying to find uh a cordless phone or a m mobile , you can hear it , but you can't quite pin it dow pin down where it is .\nmarketing: Yeah you can tell what room the mobile is {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Bu\nindustrial designer: What about {disfmarker} what if the the volume on the T_V_'s turned up massively and uh you just wanna turn down the volume {gap} can't find remote . Suppose you have to go to the T_V_ and do it manually . Mm .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nproject manager: Mm . Um\nmarketing: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Like y you wouldn't hear the speaker {gap} .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: just before we go through all of the steps here , um well what we'll do is\nmarketing: You wanna say something ?\nproject manager: um if we can look at the criteria you're gonna evaluate , and then we'll come back to the product evaluation if that's alright .\nmarketing: That's fine .\nproject manager: Yeah , is that {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Oh that's that's fine .\nproject manager: Um so is there anything here that you that you wanted to cover as in the criteria that you've covered ? And then we'll come back pretty much promptly to this .\nmarketing: What do you mean cr is there anything I wanna {disfmarker}\nproject manager: I is there any of these criteria that need any explaining ? Or is there anything that yous thought tha really would stand out compared to the others ?\nmarketing: Um , a few . {vocalsound} Something I neglected from my initial research is that Real Reactions has a a goal strategy that all of the products be inspired by material fashion , and clothing fashion . That is why fruit and veg being popular in the home and in clothing was important and they want all their products to be somehow inspired by current trends in fashion . So they say we put the fashion in electronics , well they really mean it they they're very big on fashion ,\nproject manager: Okay .\nmarketing: so . That's this bit right here . And uh this bit is this one easy to use for visitors or for anybody ? I guess it's just the same as saying easy to use interface , so it's kinda condensed into one . And we can come back to it , you said .\nproject manager: Okay .\nmarketing: So .\nproject manager: No and which we will do very very shortly . Um . Okay . Slight problem we had was that we have an amazing four Euros over budget for what we were hoping to do . Um most of it stems from the use of the L_C_D_ which I think in the end accounted for about half of our expenditure because of course we required a chip as well . Um the only way to get this down was either to ditch the a L_C_D_ , at which point we've removed a large part of how we were gonna interface , {gap} require more buttons , etcetera . Or what we did was that we um we as in I as I was quickly going over it was altering the actual structure . Um changing it to plastic and a solid unit with a single curve design would allow us to come back into the um proposed costs and we're just scraping it in , we've got point two of a Euro left over there . So we're just managing it really . Even then as well , um there was no criteria technically defined for a joystick so I've used what I think's appropriate . With any luck that won't mean that we've incurred more cost than we can actually afford to . It blows a lot of our really good ideas kind of slightly to one side , for example the possibility of having a U_S_B_ connection is definitely not viable now . Um .\nmarketing: Different languages ?\nproject manager: That should still be viable . We've got an advanced chip , we've got the use of the L_C_D_ . So being able to communicate in multiple languages is still very much a possibility .\nmarketing: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Um but what's something we need to decide on is how we're gonna go from here . {vocalsound} We do need to try and come up with an idea which could be continued with other people if need be . Um . We can I can bring the excel up sheet up and uh show you if you wish um . I really think as m much as it pains me is that we might have to go with plastic and some kind of solid design , possibly meaning that the L_C_D_ wouldn't be in this perfect place . It might be s stuck like slightly between what would be good for left handed and what would be good for a right handed person .\nuser interface: Mm-hmm I suppose o one thing that could be done is h {vocalsound} is have it um circular and have it s {vocalsound} so that the uh the pink {gap} actually goes a bit over the pinkie finger . Mm .\nproject manager: Okay .\nmarketing: Mm .\nuser interface: So that uh th\nproject manager: It very much is about making concessions , unfortunately . Um .\nuser interface: Mm .\nmarketing: Do you have any data on how much um different prints cost ? I mean can you get the entire thing printed with a design um ?\nproject manager: Um b b b da is {disfmarker} you mean on the plastic , or ?\nmarketing: {gap} .\nproject manager: Let's have a look . You now have as much information as I do . {vocalsound} Um .\nmarketing: Yeah , yeah .\nproject manager: So as you can see here , for example , the battery really not very little choice in that one . We've gone for one of the cheaper options as well . Unfortunately we require the advanced chip if we're gonna do what we're needing to . I've said single curved . We really do need it to be that way for the ergonomics of it . Um plastic for some reason incurs no cost , which I've had to very much make advantage of , despite the fact that rubber's only got a value of two Euros per unit . Problem comes here as you can see in the interface . Um if I've read this thing correctly , then we can save point five of a Euro here in that it's not per push button . That might make sense , because then a numeric keypad would come in at um what , four point five Euros , which is an awful lot , so that could well be wrong . Even if we save point five there , it would just mean that we're most likely placing it in actually just gaining a colour for the unit , which has had to be put to one side . As you can see , the use of an L_C_ display um advanced chip and what would determine the scroll wheel here as well because it's an integrated scroll scroll wheel push button that wasn't quite what I think they had in mind with a joystick .\nmarketing: Why would why would that be more expensive than an individual push button and scroll wheel together ? That's quite significantly expensive .\nproject manager: I {disfmarker} that's something you'll have to take up with the bean counters . Um\nmarketing: {gap} .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Mm . {gap} yeah .\nproject manager: as you can see I mean that's taken up well over half of the price .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: So um I'm very much open to suggestions of where we go , but because we need to shed what was four Euros off of the um the price of for what we really desired , this one comes in under price as you can see , but this was the one that sacrificed the material for the case and for the actual case design .\nmarketing: We don't even have uh speakers here . The {disfmarker} like uh we uh {disfmarker} what about speakers and transmitters and stuff like that ? Have we factored that in ?\nindustrial designer: Mm .\nproject manager: Uh no , we haven't , not {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Transmitter , receiver , speakers . Plus the extra device itself that's gonna be on a T_V_ .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Is that gonna be a button , or {disfmarker}\nproject manager: That'll {gap} it literally would just be a button .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: We might have to {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: That's too expensive {gap} isn't it ?\nproject manager: It looks like almost nothing {disfmarker} Mm . Oh good call , I missed that .\nmarketing: I I mean it's not on here , but um .\nproject manager: {gap} that's a very valid point .\nmarketing: Did they s do we have to use an advanced chip for the L_C_D_ ?\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nmarketing: Okay . Well that's {disfmarker} yeah .\nproject manager: So if we're gonna go with the L_C_ display , then that's {disfmarker}\nmarketing: What's a hand dyna dynamo ? You have to wind it up ?\nproject manager: I believe so , yeah .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: That would probably not be in keeping with the um the fashion statement and such ,\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Technology . Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Fashion .\nproject manager: yeah .\nmarketing: Okay .\nindustrial designer: So basically the only new thing is the L_C_D_ on the remote now .\nproject manager: Being manipulated by the joystick , yeah .\nindustrial designer: Oh , and joystick , yeah .\nproject manager: Which I'm defining as scroll wheel . Um .\nmarketing: And we couldn't replace the joystick , right ? Because we would need four extra buttons to replace it , up down left and right , and that would be more expensive than a {disfmarker} but is a scroll wheel not just back and forward ?\nuser interface: Mm .\nproject manager: Yeah it's just because there was no actual definition for what a joystick might be , that that's what I've labelled it for the purposes of this evaluation .\nindustrial designer: So {disfmarker} The L_C_D_ basically is the big selling point of\nproject manager: If we remove the L_C_ display , we could save ourselves\nindustrial designer: the remote .\nproject manager: a fair amount . Which you could {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: But that's what makes it uh original though ,\nuser interface: Mm . I think {gap} if we remove the the L_C_ display then there was absolutely no point to any of these meetings\nmarketing: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: isn't it ?\nuser interface: and we just {gap} we could just put our branding on any other remote control .\nmarketing: Yeah . Yeah . Um . Uh k\nproject manager: It's a shame . We should possibly have {disfmarker} If we could've increased the price we could've manufactured that and we could've got something far closer to what we were hoping to .\nmarketing: Does this does this bear in mind that {disfmarker} I mean it's a bit ridiculous that they're gonna charge us what is it , like this much money for three million if we're gonna buy three million components ,\nproject manager: Again , you'll have to argue with the accountants on that one .\nmarketing: you know .\nproject manager: Um but for the purposes of this meeting , I'm {disfmarker} we're gonna have to stick with these figures .\nmarketing: Mm . 'Kay .\nproject manager: So , I would say that it would seem like the general opinion is we're gonna keep the L_C_ display 'cause it's about what really separates us , {vocalsound} despite the cost it's gonna incur . Um\nmarketing: I think so .\nproject manager: are people maybe not happy with , but are willing to go ahead with this in going for a plastic solid case , to keep the L_C_D_ ?\nuser interface: Mm-hmm . Um yeah {gap} I mean one thing , I mean ho uh how much extra would it be to to keep I mean {vocalsound} keep the um the articulation ?\nproject manager: It's hard to tell . Um I would say that you're at least gonna take double curved ,\nuser interface: This is what I'm wondering .\nproject manager: and even then I'm not quite sure if that's incorporating the idea of articulation .\nuser interface: Oh\nmarketing: Yeah .\nuser interface: no , I think I I it d that it needn't require it to be double curved .\nindustrial designer: It can be s yeah , it can still be single curved ,\nuser interface: It's uh it's just {vocalsound} it's just {vocalsound} it's just that the case would come in t {vocalsound} would be made in two parts and then joined together with an articulation .\nindustrial designer: but {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Single curved with articulation ?\nindustrial designer: You just {gap} .\nmarketing: Could we could we not get rid of the curvy the curvous the curvaceousness and focus on the menu being the best interface ? 'Cause like we {disfmarker} do we have re restrictions on software ?\nindustrial designer: That's what we need for the joystick I think though .\nuser interface: Mm . Yeah , I mean\nmarketing: Oh but there has to be {disfmarker}\nuser interface: and {vocalsound} I mean the uh I mean if you look uh if you look closer at the uh at the prototype here , the lines here along the grip are actually quite straight . Um I mean {gap} yeah ,\nproject manager: {vocalsound} But the curves all o over {gap} hand ,\nuser interface: on the {gap} on the L_C_D_ I mean although we've done it with a curve it\nproject manager: is it ?\nuser interface: could just as easily be done um without curves . The curve that's really needed is up here ,\nmarketing: {gap} joystick .\nuser interface: to put uh to keep the joystick in a good ergonomic position for it to have it rest on the top of the hand .\nmarketing: Okay . Sure . Okay , my bad .\nproject manager: We wouldn't actually save a lot by reducing it anyway , so I mean for the purposes of this meeting maybe we can state that single curve still allows articulation .\nuser interface: Mm .\nproject manager: Um unless we hear otherwise we could go ahead with that proposal .\nmarketing: So I think the product is not gonna perform so well for my criteria .\nproject manager: Which is what we can get onto now . As long as {disfmarker} so are we gonna say {disfmarker} {gap} w we have to keep an eye on the time as well , but we're gonna say um single curved design {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Oh , wait a minute . Sample speaker ? What is a sample speaker ? Is that somewhat similar to what we want ?\nproject manager: It could well be ,\nuser interface: Mm no\nproject manager: but at a cost of {disfmarker}\nuser interface: that's that voice response thing that we got the email about .\nindustrial designer: Costs four .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nuser interface: But I thought it was just completely pointless .\nmarketing: You got a email about voice response ?\nuser interface: Yeah .\nmarketing: I did not ,\nuser interface: Alright .\nmarketing: so .\nuser interface: B i basically it was {gap} saying that our labs had come up with a chip that you could , you know , say hello to , and it would say hello back in a friendly female voice {gap} . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay , yeah we'll definitely won't go with that one .\nmarketing: We won't go with that one , did you say ?\nproject manager: Yeah , that's voice recognition , so .\nmarketing: I mean I {disfmarker} we {disfmarker} Okay , okay .\nproject manager: Um . So , okay yeah , battery definitely , {disfmarker}\nmarketing: So it looks like we're gonna get rid of the whole loca {vocalsound} locator thing .\nproject manager: It looks like it unless we can manage to put it in under point two Euros , um .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Okay . {vocalsound} Okay .\nuser interface: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: Maybe even slight well oh yeah , pretty much point two Euros , I'd say . So we'll leave that one for now . {gap} we'll just have {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: Are we going for a special colour at all ?\nproject manager: It's uh a case of um I'm uh slightly unsure . One {disfmarker} point five of a Euro for one push button doesn't sound quite right . So maybe it's a case of a push button is maybe one or more . Um .\nuser interface: Mm .\nindustrial designer: Well\nproject manager: At which point if {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: I was {gap} for a case . Or had you already incorporated that ?\nmarketing: Oh , special colour for the case .\nproject manager: Well you got point five there . It's literally a case of whether or not this is correct . I'm not quite sure if they're {disfmarker} I don't think they mean point five Euros per button .\nuser interface: Okay , well\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nuser interface: l let's say that and then we can have our special coloured case\nproject manager: So\nuser interface: and then we at least have {disfmarker} make it a little harder to lose .\nproject manager: There we go .\nuser interface: Because most m most remotes are a fairly dingy colour that gets camouflaged under any pile of crap in a living room .\nmarketing: W what's the default colour ? White or black ?\nproject manager: Black's probably the normal colour you'd say ,\nuser interface: Or grey .\nproject manager: yeah .\nmarketing: Right .\nproject manager: I quite like that colour that you're fetching there ,\nuser interface: Yellow . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: it's uh definitely for make it glow in the dark even better .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: {vocalsound} So will we go with that then ?\nuser interface: Okay .\nproject manager: It's not and we can see {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: we'll come back to uh your evaluation\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Sure .\nproject manager: which you're probably now going to pan us but there we go .\nmarketing: Okay . Okay .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: So uh {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Just to give you an idea , um you want to go maybe a bit quickly as well , I'm not sure how much time . We've not hit the five minute mark warning yet ,\nmarketing: Right okay . Okay .\nproject manager: but .\nindustrial designer: Think it's ten minutes left . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Ten ."}, {"chapter": 3, "start_ms": 1530000, "topic": "Product evaluation", "transcript_text": "marketing: 'Kay .

Could we stretch {disfmarker} no still , it's not shaped like a banana is {disfmarker}\nuser interface: That's kinda {disfmarker} {gap} i\nproject manager: It's kind o it\nuser interface: it won't be when it's been\nproject manager: probably {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Oh is that 'cause it's flat ?\nuser interface: budgeted .\nmarketing: What is {disfmarker} what fruit or veg is flat ?\nuser interface: I I think s I I think this isn't {disfmarker} not particularly fruit and veggie . Um .\nmarketing: Yeah . Or we might have to suffer badly for this one as well . {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yellow courgette .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Well\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I mean it's probably more fruit and veg than most other things out there bar fruit and veg , so , {vocalsound} what , four ?\nmarketing: Four ? Oh that's it's very ambitious ,\nproject manager: Is that being too generous ?\nuser interface: Mm . I'd {vocalsound} I'd I don't think fruit and veg is the sole criterion . {vocalsound} Is the sole criterion for being um fashion {gap} fashionable or inspired by current fashions .\nmarketing: yeah , um .\nproject manager: Oh dear , {gap} .\nmarketing: Sure . Inspired by {gap} .\nuser interface: Um I'd g I'd rate I'd rate this fairly highly from that point of view actually .\nindustrial designer: Well this this what we're gonna t this is their motto , like .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: And we're we're not doing well on it .\nmarketing: This is their strategy . I m imagine we actually had some money invested in this and the amount that we invest is gonna be proportional to the marks . Might {disfmarker} we might wanna be a bit more skepible sceptical about this one .\nproject manager: What would you think yourself ?\nmarketing: I would say {disfmarker} I mean it's it's not at all , right ? {vocalsound} In any way or shape or form .\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Well , it's kind of curved\nmarketing: We didn't m\nproject manager: and we can make it yellow , and that's pretty much banana like .\nmarketing: Okay , the the yellow banana like thing is I think is okay .\nproject manager: Si it's got a curve to it .\nmarketing: Right five . Is that {vocalsound} sound reasonable ?\nproject manager: Am I {disfmarker} do you think I'm stretching the uh the use of the banana ?\nindustrial designer: Yeah , I'll go with five .\nmarketing: Five . {vocalsound} Yeah . 'Kay , so we have one , two , three , four , five , six , seven . So five , seven , ten , sixteen , twenty one . Which gives us an average of three . It's {disfmarker} well this would be in the middle . So we it's it's not bad . It's in the good section .\nproject manager: It's not bad and considering the {vocalsound} {disfmarker} don't pick the pen . Um .\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Oops . Sorry . {vocalsound} I'm I'm sorry .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Y oh and you've knocked batteries out .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Um right okay it's {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: 'S bad design , that thing . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: considering the price we had to get this in , to have a positive {disfmarker} you know , even based on the four of us being heavily biased , um\nmarketing: Mm-hmm . Yeah .\nproject manager: {vocalsound} it was gonna be quite hard to get anything standing out I'd say possibly , based on um the the cost features .\nuser interface: Mm .\nindustrial designer: Mm , yeah .\nmarketing: Even if we were to increase this entire thing by by seven , we were to go down a grade to to four , we would have to do {disfmarker} I mean we didn't we weren't that kinda optimistic too optim overly optimistic . You know like we didn't we didn't add we didn't subtract a whole seven points from these things , so I think we're definitely on the good bit .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Even if we gave this one seven and this one seven , that's still only three extra points over seven . You know , it's {disfmarker} yeah ,\nuser interface: Mm . Personally , I think given that the product um only replaces a single remote control\nmarketing: we did it w it was okay . It was good .\nuser interface: that you've already got , are people really gonna shell out twenty five Euros for something that's only marginally good ?\nindustrial designer: Well , it depends who your {disfmarker} who's {disfmarker} what the target people are , like you'd say maybe the fashion conscious\nproject manager: Maybe it's been targeted {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: women would be going , oh look at that , 's cool , it looks like a {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nindustrial designer: it's yellow , looks like a banana , it's cool it's gotta {disfmarker} look good in the sitting room .\nproject manager: Hide it in the fruit basket .\nindustrial designer: Rather than the L_C_D_ whereas uh more technical like like more uh people in with the latest technology {gap} it's good , it's got an L_C_D_ screen 's only got two buttons and a joystick . So , which which kind of people would be more likely to buy it ?\nproject manager: Probably the people technologically . They're usually the ones that buy pointless stuff .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I think so .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I mean my mum still has not learnt how to use text messaging on her phone , and she's had it for a long time , you know . She uses it to make phone calls and that's it .\nindustrial designer: {gap} .\nmarketing: Yeah . So I think if sh if my mum saw a remote control like this with only two buttons and a joystick , I mean that'll probably be the first one she decides not to buy , you know .\nproject manager: Mm-hmm .\nmarketing: She'd be like is this a remote control , I don't {disfmarker} how do you use it , and stuff like that . So even if it is really user friendly to us , but we're used to using menus all the time .\nuser interface: Mm-hmm . I s {vocalsound} I suppose one thing is that b because it's technically innovative , um for someone who's sort of technophobic , the fact that it simply looks unfamiliar would be daunting .\nmarketing: Yeah . Yeah .\nuser interface: Um .\nmarketing: I think it's totally uh radical to have a remote control with no no numbered buttons ,\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nmarketing: yeah .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nmarketing: But like radical good , maybe ."}, {"chapter": 4, "start_ms": 2562000, "topic": "A summary for the whole project", "transcript_text": "project manager: Okay . Um don't know how lo much longer we've got . At least five minutes I think . Um quickly we'll pop onto project evaluation . Um . So , we've got these uh four criteria here for uh satisfaction . Does anybody want to um um do you have any opinions on any of them ? For example um {disfmarker} we'll work backwards I suppose . The ability to work on this project using the technology we've been presented with . Um {gap} people made good use of the uh pen and paper ?\nuser interface: Yeah ,\nproject manager: I would say {gap} {disfmarker}\nuser interface: got notes and doodles .\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Wrote nearly a page ,\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nmarketing: but not {gap} .\nproject manager: I'm not quite sure what the advantage for us using a digital pen might be .\nuser interface: Well I think this is a {disfmarker} I think the digital pen's mostly for the benefit of the uh\nmarketing: I think tracking .\nuser interface: of the researchers studying this . It's all p goes into their corpus .\nproject manager: It must {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Though it would have been nice to be able to transfer the um transfer our n our paper notes onto the uh computer ourselves .\nmarketing: Yeah , that woulda been pretty good .\nproject manager: It does seem like the paper's still a heavy consideration for taking notes . So maybe this is literally just a way around it . Um I dunno . How are people satisfied with the teamwork we've managed to display today ?\nuser interface: {gap} .\nmarketing: I'd {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: Good .\nmarketing: yeah I liked it , yeah .\nproject manager: Leadership . As much as can be leadered in this uh thing .\nindustrial designer: Very good .\nmarketing: I li yeah , top marks .\nproject manager: Um last one we've got is room for creativity .\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Well {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound} Unti uh uh until uh until accounts came along ,\nproject manager: Now , I think we got {disfmarker}\nuser interface: {gap} squish .\nindustrial designer: We're burs bursting with creativity .\nmarketing: yeah . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Yeah\nmarketing: We we're not lacking in ideas , you know it's {disfmarker} that was not the problem .\nproject manager: I think of {disfmarker} in the end , ideas that can be used {gap} sadly {gap} . Not so much that we weren't full of ideas , but of ones that are gonna allow us to actually build the thing . It's a bit of a pity .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: Um I would have to agree on that . I think we needed a larger budget .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: If you're going to aim your a um product maybe at the technological kind of sector , then you can afford to maybe jack the price up slightly from what it is .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nproject manager: Because they will pay outrageous cash to {gap}\nuser interface: Mm . I mean I th {vocalsound} I mean I think to r retaining the s the more sort of bio-morphic form in the articulation would gain more in s uh would gain more profit in sales than it would lose in uh\nproject manager: first on the market .\nuser interface: in added expense .\nproject manager: Mm .\nindustrial designer: And the price was like {disfmarker} it was twice the w assembly cost . And would it have to be twice that ? It could be like coulda had the assembly {gap} like maybe fifteen Euro .\nproject manager: It could even {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: We'll still settle for twenty five {vocalsound} .\nproject manager: That's true , yeah .\nindustrial designer: Maybe . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Um I suppose these are all that will have to be taken up with a at a different group at I guess . As to a {gap} the costs involved . But I mean we've got a a prototype .\nuser interface: Such as it is .\nproject manager: {vocalsound} So I dunno , I I think it's gone okay today , considering the information that we've had at our disposal , and um such .\nmarketing: Maybe the counts wou woulda been better if we had a list or more {disfmarker} Yeah , to begin with .\nindustrial designer: In the beginning , yeah .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: Probably would have {disfmarker} mean we could have come up with a lot more solid design in the end ,\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: I would have to agree . It is very much a pity to um get so far into the stage and then find out that maybe some of your ideas are just a bit too expensive . Always hard to tell until you know the costs . Um . Okay . Are the costs within budget ? Well ,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: they are now that we have our slightly less than capable product .\nmarketing: Okay .\nproject manager: We've evaluated it , and we can say that we came out with a value of three .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nuser interface: Actually I want th one thing I would say {disfmarker}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: I mean something that could perhaps be part of the product mm the um m product testing market research process would be to uh produce mock-ups of both versions and see just how much of a difference the over {gap} going over-budget um m would make to sales .\nproject manager: It's {disfmarker} yeah ?\nmarketing: And like response from consumers {gap} .\nuser interface: And we could even you know , market two versions .\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Wee cheapie version with the nice bio-morphic rubber . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: And then the final one where you get to call it Hal .\nuser interface: Yes .\nproject manager: But we'll go into that later .\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Sure .\nproject manager: Right um\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: is there anything else that anybody would like to to add , um {gap} anything they think that's not been covered , before I quickly write up a final report . Um I dunno , I mean we've got a product . We maybe aren't as happy with it as we'd like to be , but we've got something we think we can maybe stick onto the the market and sell . And of course something we have been avoiding talking about 'cause of we've no information is selling them directly to the manufacturers . There is a huge market .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: I mean we've briefly touched on it but we've no more knowledge then there's little we can say on that .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nuser interface: Mm .\nproject manager: Yeah . So um unless anybody's got anything they'd like to add , we can maybe round this up slightly earlier than we'd need to and then we can finish up the writing and such .\nuser interface: And I can get my bus . Okay .\nproject manager: Yeah ?\nmarketing: Yeah . Okay , let's {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Uh thank you for your participation .\nmarketing: Thank you .\nuser interface: Thank you .\nmarketing: {vocalsound} I was actually kind of upset you know at the budget , and that we had to cut a lot of stuff . It's like man , we we can't have the locator thing . And s yeah that's just bad . Do you think maybe {gap} the prices were were made ?\nproject manager: That {gap} a question we can ask {gap} . {vocalsound}"}]}
