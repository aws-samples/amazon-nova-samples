What is the uh {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the English co uh um cognate if you want , for \" Sankt Nimmerlandstag \" ?\ngrad b: Keine Ahnung\ngrad c: Sort of \" We 'll do it on {disfmarker} when you say on that d day it means it 'll never happen .\nprofessor d: Yeah .\ngrad b: OK .\nprofessor d: Right .\ngrad c: Do you have an expression ? Probably you sh\ngrad b: Not that I know of actually .\ngrad c: Yeah , when hell {disfmarker} Yep , we 'll do it when hell freezes over .\nprofessor d: Yeah .\ngrad c: So maybe that should be another {vocalsound} property in there .\nphd f: Right .\nprofessor d: Yeah . Yeah .\nundergrad e: Never .\nprofessor d: No .\ngrad c: OK . Um , the reason why {disfmarker} why do we go there in the first place IE uh {disfmarker} it 's either uh {disfmarker} for sightseeing , for meeting people , for running errands , or doing business . Entertainment is a good one in there , I think . I agree .\ngrad b: So , business is supposed to uh , be sort of {disfmarker} it {disfmarker} like professional type stuff , right , or something like that ?\ngrad c: Yep .\ngrad b: OK . Um .\ngrad c: I mean {disfmarker} this w this is uh an old uh Johno thing . He sort of had it in there . \" Who is the {disfmarker} the tour is the person ? \" So it might be a tourist ,\ngrad b: Mm - hmm .\ngrad c: it might be a business man who 's using the system , who wants to sort of go to some {disfmarker}\ngrad b: Yeah .\nprofessor d: Yeah , or {disfmarker} or both .\ngrad b: Yeah . Yeah , I mean like for example my {disfmarker} my father is about to travel to Prague .\ngrad c: Yep .\ngrad b: He 'll be there for two weeks . He is going to uh {disfmarker} He 's there to teach a course at the business school but he also is touring around and so he may have some mixture of these things .\ngrad c: Yep .\nprofessor d: Mmm .\ngrad c: Yep .\nprofessor d: Sure . Right .\ngrad c: He would {disfmarker}\nphd f: What ab What do you have in mind in terms of um {disfmarker} socializing ? What kind of activities ?\ngrad c: Eh , just meeting people , basically . \" I want to meet someone somewhere \" , which be puts a very heavy constraint on the \" EVA \"\nphd f: Oh {disfmarker}\ngrad b: Yeah .\ngrad c: you know , because then if you 're meeting somebody at the town hall , you 're not entering it usually , you 're just {disfmarker} want to approach it .\ngrad b: So {disfmarker} I mean , does this capture , like , where do you put {disfmarker} \" Exchange money \" is an errand , right ? But what about uh {disfmarker}\ngrad c: Yep .\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm\ngrad b: So , like \" Go to a movie \" is now entertainment , \" Dine out \" is {disfmarker}\nphd f: Socializing , I guess .\nprofessor d: No , I I well , I dunno . Let {disfmarker} Let {disfmarker} well , we 'll put it somewhere ,\ngrad b: So I mean {disfmarker} Right .\nprofessor d: but {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} um {disfmarker} I would say that if \" Dine out \" is a special c uh {disfmarker} if you 're doing it for that purpose then it 's entertainment .\ngrad b: Yeah .\nprofessor d: And {disfmarker} we 'll also as y as you 'll s further along we 'll get into business about \" Well , you 're {disfmarker} you know {disfmarker} this is going over a meal time , do you wanna stop for a meal or pick up food or something ? \"\ngrad b: Mm - hmm .\nprofessor d: And that 's different . That 's {disfmarker} that 's sort of part of th that 's not a destination reason , that 's sort of \" en passant , \" right .\ngrad b: Right .\ngrad c: That goes with the \" energy depletion \" function , blech .\ngrad b: Yeah .\nprofessor d: Right , yeah .\ngrad c: OK , \" endpoint \" .\ngrad b: \" Tourist needs food , badly \""}, {"chapter": 2, "start_ms": 0, "topic": "Design of data collection", "transcript_text": "grad c: Now can you give me the uh {pause} remote T ?\nprofessor d: OK , so Eva , co uh {disfmarker} could you read your numbers ?\ngrad a: Go ahead and read . OK .\nprofessor d: Yeah .\ngrad c: Alright .\nprofessor d: Yeah , let 's get started . Um {disfmarker} Hopefully Nancy will come , if not , she won't .\ngrad b: Uh , Robert , do you uh have any way to turn off your uh screensaver on there so that it 's not going off every {disfmarker} uh , it seems to have about at two minute {disfmarker}\ngrad c: Yeah , I 've {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} it 's not that I didn't try .\ngrad b: OK .\ngrad c: and um I {disfmarker} I told it to stay on forever and ever , but if it 's not plugged in it just doesn't obey my commands .\ngrad b: OK .\ngrad c: It has a mind .\ngrad b: Got it .\ngrad c: But I I just {disfmarker} You know , sort of keep on wiggling .\nundergrad e: Wants to conserve .\ngrad b: Yeah , OK .\ngrad c: But uh {disfmarker} we 'll just be m m working on it at intensity so it doesn't happen . We 'll see . Should we plunge right into it ?\nprofessor d: Yeah .\ngrad c: So , would you like to {disfmarker}\nprofessor d: I think so .\ngrad c: So what I 've tried to do here is list all the decision nodes that we have identified on this {pause} side . Commented and {disfmarker} what they 're about and sort of {disfmarker} the properties we may um give them . And here are the uh {disfmarker} tasks to be implemented via our data collection . So all of these tasks {disfmarker} The reading is out of these tasks more or less imply that the user wants to go there , sometime or the other . And analogously for example , here we have our EVA um {disfmarker} intention . And these are the data tasks where w we can assume the person would like to enter , view or just approach the thing . Analogously the same on the object information we can see that , you know , we have sort of created these tasks before we came up with our decision nodes so there 's a lot of things where we have no analogous tasks , and {pause} that may or may not be a problem . We can change the tasks slightly if we feel that we should have data for e sort of for every decision node so {disfmarker} trying to im um {disfmarker} implant the intention of going to a place now , going to a place later on the same tour , or trying to plant the intention of going sometime on the next tour , or the next day or whenever .\nprofessor d: Right , right .\ngrad c: But I think that might be overdoing it a little .\nprofessor d: So {disfmarker} Yeah . So let me pop up a level . And uh s s make sure that we 're all oriented the same . So What we 're gonna do today is two related things . Uh one of them is to work on the semantics of the belief - net which is going to be the main inference engine for thi the system uh making decisions . And decisions are going to turn out to be parameter choices for calls on other modules . so f the natural language understanding thing is uh , we think gonna only have to choose parameters , but You know , a fairly large set of parameters . So to do that , we need to do two things . One of which is figure out what all the choices are , which we 've done a fair amount . Then we need to figure out what influences its choices and finally we have to do some technical work on the actual belief relations and presumably estimates of the probabilities and stuff . But we aren't gonna do the probability stuff today . Technical stuff we 'll do {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} another day . Probably next week . But we are gonna worry about all the decisions and the things that pert that contribute to them . And we 're also , sort of uh in the same process , going to work with Fey on what there should be in the dialogues . So One of the s steps that 's coming up real soon is to actually get subjects uh {disfmarker} in here , and have them actually record like this . Uh record dialogues more or less . And {disfmarker} depending on what Fey sort of provokes them to say , we 'll get information on different things .\ngrad c: Well how people phrase different intentions more or less ,\nprofessor d: So {disfmarker} Fo - v yeah people with the {disfmarker} phrase them\ngrad c: huh ?\nprofessor d: and so {disfmarker} Uh for , you know , Keith and people worrying about what constructions people use , uh {disfmarker} we have some i we have some ways to affect that by the way the dialogues go . So what Robert kindly did , is to lay out a table of the kinds of uh {pause} things that {disfmarker} that might come up , and , the kinds of decisions . So the uh {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} on the left are decision nodes , and discreet values . So if {disfmarker} if we 're right , you can get by with um just this middle column worth of decisions , and it 's not all that many , and it 's perfectly feasible technically to build belief - nets that will do that . And he has a handout .\ngrad c: Yeah . Maybe it was too fast plunging in there , because j we have two updates .\nprofessor d: Yeah .\ngrad c: Um you can look at this if you want , these are what our subject 's going to have to fill out . Any comments I can {disfmarker} can still be made and the changes will be put in correspondingly .\nundergrad e: m {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Yes .\ngrad c: Let me summarize in two sentences , mainly for Eva 's benefit , who probably has not heard about the data collection , at all .\ngrad a: OK .\ngrad c: Or have you heard about it ?\ngrad a: Not that much you didn't .\ngrad c: No . OK . We were gonna put this in front of people . They give us some information on themselves .\ngrad a: OK .\ngrad c: Then {disfmarker} then they will read uh {disfmarker} a task where lots of German words are sort of thrown in between . And um {disfmarker} and they have to read isolated proper names And these change {disfmarker}\nprofessor d: S I don't see a release\ngrad c: No , this is not the release form . This is the speaker information form .\nprofessor d: Got it . OK , fine . OK .\ngrad c: The release form is over there in that box .\nprofessor d: Alright , fair enough .\ngrad c: And um {disfmarker} And then they gonna have to f um um choose from one of these tasks , which are listed here . They {disfmarker} they pick a couple , say three {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} uh six as a matter of fact . Six different things they sort of think they would do if they were in Heidelberg or traveling someplace {disfmarker} and um {disfmarker} and they have a map .\ngrad b: Hmm .\ngrad c: Like this . Very sketchy , simplified map . And they can take notes on that map . And then they call this computer system that works perfectly , and understands everything .\ngrad a: OK .\ngrad c: And um {disfmarker}\ngrad b: This is a fictional system obviously ,\ngrad c: The comp Yeah , the computer system sits right in front of you ,\ngrad b: huh .\ngrad c: that 's Fey .\nundergrad e: I 've {disfmarker} I understand everything .\nprofessor d: And she does know everything .\nundergrad e: Yes I do .\ngrad c: And she has a way of making this machine talk . So she can copy sentences into a window , or type really fast and this machine will use speech synthesis to produce that . So if you ask \" How do I get to the castle \" then a m s several seconds later it 'll come out of here \" In order to get to the castle you do {disfmarker} \""}, {"chapter": 3, "start_ms": 3318000, "topic": "Meeting conclusion", "transcript_text": "professor d: Right .\ngrad b: Um sometime , I have to talk to some subset of the people in this group , at least about um what sort of constructions I 'm looking for . I mean , you know obviously like just again , looking at this one uh thing , you know , I saw y things from {disfmarker} sort of as general as argument structure constructions . Oh , you know , I have to do Verb Phrase . I have to do uh {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} unbounded dependencies , you know , which have a variety of constructions in {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} instantiate that . On the other hand I have to have , you know , there 's particular uh , fixed expressions , or semi - fixed expressions like \" Get \" plus path expression for , you know , \" how d ho how do I get there ? \" ,\nprofessor d: Mm - hmm .\ngrad b: \" How do I get in ? \" , \" How do I get away ? \"\nprofessor d: Right .\ngrad b: and all that kind of stuff . Um , so there 's a variety of sort of different sorts of constructions\nprofessor d: Absolutely .\ngrad b: and it {disfmarker} you know it 's {disfmarker} it 's sort of like anything goes . Like {disfmarker}\nprofessor d: OK , so this is {disfmarker} I think we 're gonna mainly work on with George .\ngrad b: OK .\nprofessor d: OK , and hi let me f th {disfmarker} say what I think is {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} so the idea is {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker} first of all I misspoke when I said we thought you should do the constructions . Cause apparently for a linguist that means to do completely and perfectly . So what I {disfmarker} yeah , OK , {disfmarker} So what {disfmarker} what I meant was \" Do a first cut at \" .\ngrad b: er {disfmarker} that 's what Yeah , yeah .\nprofessor d: OK , Because uh {disfmarker} we do wanna get them r u perfectly {disfmarker} but I think we 're gonna have to do a first cut at a lot of them to see how they interact .\ngrad b: Of course . Right , exactly . Now it {disfmarker} w we talked about this before , right . And I {disfmarker} I me it would it would be completely out of the question to really do more than , say , like , oh I don't know , ten , over the summer ,\nprofessor d: Yeah .\ngrad b: but uh , but you know obviously we need to get sort of a general view of what things look like , so yeah .\nprofessor d: Right . So the idea is going to be to do {disfmarker} sort of like Nancy did in some of the er these papers where you do enough of them so you can go from top to bottom {disfmarker} so you can do f you know , f f uh {disfmarker} have a complete story ov of s of some piece of dialogue .\ngrad b: Mm - hmm .\nprofessor d: And that 's gonna be much more useful than having all of the clausal constructions and nothing else , or {disfmarker} or {disfmarker} or something like that .\ngrad b: Yeah . Sure . Yeah .\nprofessor d: So that the {disfmarker} the trick is going to be t to take this and pick a {disfmarker} some sort of lattice of constructions ,\ngrad b: Mm - hmm .\nprofessor d: so some lexical and some phrasal , and {disfmarker} and , you know ,\ngrad b: Mm - hmm .\nprofessor d: whatever you need in order to uh , be able to then , uh , by hand , you know , explain , some fraction of the utterances .\ngrad b: Mm - hmm . Yeah .\nprofessor d: And so , exactly which ones will partly depend on your research interests and a bunch of other things .\ngrad b: Mm - hmm . Sure . OK . But I mean in terms of the s th sort of level of uh {disfmarker} of analysis , you know , these don't necessarily have to be more complex than like the \" Out of \" construction in the BCP paper where it 's just like , you know , half a page on each one or something .\nprofessor d: Correct . Oh yeah {disfmarker} yeah . V a half a page is {disfmarker} is what we 'd like .\ngrad b: Yeah .\nprofessor d: And if {disfmarker} if there 's something that really requires a lot more than that then it does and we have to do it ,\ngrad b: Yeah .\nprofessor d: but {disfmarker}\ngrad b: For the first cut , that should be fine , yeah .\nprofessor d: Yeah .\ngrad c: We could sit down and think of sort of the {disfmarker} the ideal speaker utterances ,\ngrad b: Mm - hmm .\ngrad c: and I mean two or three that follow each other , so , where we can also sort of , once we have everything up and running , show the tremendous , insane inferencing capabilities of our system .\ngrad b: Mm - hmm .\ngrad c: So , you know , as {disfmarker} as the SmartKom people have . This is sort of their standard demo dialogue , which is , you know , what the system survives and nothing but that .\ngrad b: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .\ngrad c: Um , we could also sor sort of have the analogen of o our sample sentences , the ideal sentences where we have complete construction coverage and , sort of , they match nicely .\ngrad b: Mm - hmm .\ngrad c: So the {disfmarker} the \" How do I get to X ? \" ,\ngrad b: Yeah .\ngrad c: you know , that 's definitely gonna be uh , a major one .\ngrad b: Yeah . That 's about six times in this little one here , so uh , {vocalsound} yeah .\ngrad c: Yep .\nprofessor d: Right .\ngrad c: \" Where is X ? \" might be another one which is not too complicated .\ngrad b: Yeah . Mm - hmm .\ngrad c: And um \" Tell me something about X . \"\ngrad b: Yeah .\ngrad c: And hey , that 's {disfmarker} that 's already covering eighty percent of the system 's functionality .\nprofessor d: Ye - Right , but it 's not covering eighty percent of the intellectual interest .\ngrad b: Yeah .\ngrad c: No , we can w throw in an \" Out of Film \" construction if you want to , but {disfmarker}\nprofessor d: No , no , no . Well the {disfmarker} th the thing is there 's a lot that needs to be done to get this right .\ngrad c: OK .\nprofessor d: OK , I th We done ?\ngrad c: I have one bit of news .\nprofessor d: Good .\ngrad c: Um , the action planner guy has wrote {disfmarker} has written a {disfmarker} a p lengthy {disfmarker} proposal on how he wants to do the action planning .\nprofessor d: Good .\ngrad c: And I responded to him , also rather lengthy , how he should do the action planning . And {disfmarker}\nprofessor d: \" Action planning \" meaning \" Discourse Modeling \" ?\ngrad c: Yes . And I tacked on a little paragraph about the fact that the whole world calls that module a dis disc dialogue manager ,\nprofessor d: Right .\ngrad c: and wouldn't it make sense to do this here too ?\nprofessor d: Right .\ngrad c: And also Rainer M Malaka is going to be visiting us shortly , most likely in the beginning of June .\nprofessor d: Uh - huh , I 'll be gone .\ngrad c: Yeah . He - he 's just in a conference somewhere and he is just swinging through town .\nprofessor d: Sure , OK .\ngrad c: And um {disfmarker} m making me incapable of going to NAACL , for which I had funding . But . No , no Pittsburg this year .\ngrad b: Hmm .\ngrad c: When is the uh Santa Barbara ?\nprofessor d: S\ngrad c: Who is going to ? uh should a lot of people . That 's something I will {disfmarker} would {disfmarker} sort of enjoy .\nprofessor d: Probably should go . That was {disfmarker} that 's one you should probably go to .\ngrad c: Yep .\ngrad b: How much does it cost ?\ngrad c: There 's\ngrad b: I haven't planned to go .\nprofessor d: Uh , probably we can uh {disfmarker} pay for it .\ngrad b: OK .\nprofessor d: Um a student rate shouldn't be very high . So , if we all decide it 's a good idea for you to go then you 'll {disfmarker} we 'll pay for it .\ngrad b: Right . Sure .\nundergrad e: Then you can go .\nprofessor d: I mean I {disfmarker} I don't have a feeling one way or the other at the moment ,\ngrad b: OK .\nprofessor d: but it probably is . OK , great .\ngrad b: Thanks ."}]}
