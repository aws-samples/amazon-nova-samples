So which is uh good , because we had a price gap of twelve point five Euros .\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: So for the financial aspect it's okay , we can uh {disfmarker} we can continue with this product uh as if ,\nmarketing: We have a good price and uh {vocalsound} .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nproject manager: So this prototype is quite nice . {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay .\nmarketing: Good .\nuser interface: Because I saw uh some phones that were banana shaped , uh wireless phones not mobile ones , wireless for the house ,\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah . Okay .\nuser interface: uh quite big also ,\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: and they were selling {gap} something like a hundred Euros , two hundred Euros .\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Just a {vocalsound} just a phone , wireless .\nproject manager: So having this at twenty five Euros is uh quite attractive , I think .\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nproject manager: I think the {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: But almo also the complexity between a phone and a remote control is not {disfmarker} cannot compare .\nuser interface: Yeah . Yeah ,\nproject manager: Yeah .\nuser interface: it's much more complex , but {disfmarker}\nproject manager: So , I think , we can summarise . So we have seen the prototype .

You have a presentation ?\nmarketing: Uh yeah just a {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Participant four , yes .\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Four . Evaluation .\nproject manager: Okay . Okay .\nmarketing: Okay . So you can go . We can go through .\nproject manager: Okay .\nmarketing: So I made an evaluation and the the evaluation criteria is made according to {vocalsound} the users' requirements and the market trends we talked about uh during the previous uh meetings . So you can go through and {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Okay .\nmarketing: okay so uh we have uh six points . We we talked about before .\nproject manager: Okay .\nmarketing: So we we want to have a product fancy look and feel , technologically innovative , easy to use , fashion , {vocalsound} easy to find in a room , and robust ,\nproject manager: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm .\nmarketing: uh and uh uh I have a scale of uh seven points .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nmarketing: Okay . So I go through all the uh all the points here ,\nproject manager: Yeah .\nmarketing: and uh according to what you think about the this project you can uh mm make a one point , two point or seven point . Okay ?\nproject manager: Okay .\nmarketing: And after we ha we have an an average , and uh we see .\nproject manager: Okay .\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm .\nmarketing: The {disfmarker} okay ? {vocalsound} Uh so uh fancy look and feel , what do you think ?\nproject manager: Okay . Maybe you can presen {vocalsound}\nmarketing: F between o one and seven .\nproject manager: okay . Maybe {disfmarker} {vocalsound} hold it .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound} So I think it's uh very uh very nice . What do you think ?\nuser interface: I give it a {disfmarker} I give it a five .\nproject manager: Yeah . So it's between one and seven ? Seven is the highest uh ?\nmarketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} Seven is the {disfmarker}\nproject manager: I will give a six .\nindustrial designer: I will give a a five .\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm .\nuser interface: {vocalsound} And you ?\nmarketing: {gap} sorry .\nuser interface: Do you vote uh Christine ?\nmarketing: {gap} eh ?\nuser interface: Do you also vote ?\nmarketing: {vocalsound} No , I just want to see something {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Maybe we all have to agree on a common {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Well , we can {gap} very easily {vocalsound} .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Uh I think uh {gap} {vocalsound} and need to {gap} as well {vocalsound} .\nproject manager: No problem .

Yeah .\nproject manager: Okay , let's say that seven is the best .\nmarketing: Or maybe we can say s seven is the best mm {vocalsound} .\nproject manager: Okay . So so do note the grade we have five , six for me ,\nindustrial designer: Five .\nproject manager: five . And what what's your choice ?\nmarketing: Oh sorry . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: How much would you give on the fancy aspect , on the fashionable aspect ?\nmarketing: Six {disfmarker} Uh s you can {disfmarker} how much what ?\nproject manager: How much would you {disfmarker} you don't answer to this uh questionnaire ?\nmarketing: Oh yes I mm I dunno mm , I think six , it's a good uh {disfmarker}\nuser interface: So it will have five point five average .\nproject manager: Five point five average .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: Okay .\nuser interface: Mm .\nmarketing: Wa can {gap} . {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Okay .\nproject manager: Well , does it {disfmarker}\nmarketing: {vocalsound} I sorry .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Okay . So after , the technological aspect ?\nproject manager: Okay , techne technological aspect .\nmarketing: So we we said uh we have uh a new technological uh thing with a wheel .\nproject manager: Yeah , we have the wheel . We also have the rubber material ,\nmarketing: Uh .\nproject manager: which make it uh like new also . I think I would give a five .\nuser interface: It's {gap} four .\nproject manager: Four ?\nindustrial designer: A four also , because , except for the wheel , we don't have so much innovation .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: The rubber is {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Okay .\nindustrial designer: Uh a four . I I {disfmarker}\nuser interface: D are we including the voice {disfmarker} are you glu are we including the voice in the end or not ? Huh ?\nproject manager: No .\nuser interface: No . Okay .\nproject manager: So\nmarketing: No .\nproject manager: what's your uh grade ?\nmarketing: Four .\nproject manager: Four ?

Thir\nmarketing: That's that's okay ? Six .\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Six is a good {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Okay .\nmarketing: Good . Uh if we say that seven it's uh it's the better ,\nproject manager: Yeah , the be .\nindustrial designer: {gap}\nuser interface: Yeah , the top {disfmarker}\nmarketing: and when uh s six sit six are good {disfmarker} it's a good uh p product , I think .\nproject manager: Okay , so six is a {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Mm . So will become eight soon ?\nproject manager: So it's a good evaluation , I think . It's very promising .\nuser interface: Yeah , well it's a bit biased . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Huh ."}, {"chapter": 4, "start_ms": 1578000, "topic": "Celebration for the success of the project and their teamwork", "transcript_text": "project manager: The the the financial aspect were okay .
