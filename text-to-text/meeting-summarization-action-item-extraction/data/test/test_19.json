We can have a good look at that . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: You pass it round to have a look .\nuser interface: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . Y no , it's a slightly curved around the sides . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Mm very nice .\nuser interface: Um , it's almost curved like up to the main display as well . And the little line at the bottom indicates the bit {disfmarker} the panel that you pull down .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nuser interface: And the extra function buttons are below that panel on the little line .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nuser interface: And we've got the stick on the button with the company logo on .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nindustrial designer: We also have a apple slash cherry design at the top .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound} So it is , yeah .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} {gap} {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Cherry would be alright actually .\nuser interface: Yeah ,\nmarketing: Yeah .\nuser interface: it's a bit more fun , isn't it ? And it's kinda not really at a kind of {disfmarker} you think apple , you think computers , like Apple Mac .\nindustrial designer: Yeah , yeah , we might get a {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Mm-hmm . Copyright , yeah . What's this this one ?\nuser interface: Yeah , and cherries are fun , summery .\nmarketing: What's that one there ?\nuser interface: Ah , that's the mute .\nindustrial designer: For the M_ . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Oh , okay . Right .\nuser interface: {gap} {vocalsound} It {disfmarker} it'd probably have to be labelled mute .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: They're thinking {disfmarker}\nuser interface: But um , we didn't have anything small enough to write .\nmarketing: Uh-huh .\nindustrial designer: For the first time , well it was hard to get the h um the actual labelling on the individual buttons .\nmarketing: Okay . Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah . Uh , we just chose simple shapes for all them .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Um , the important ones are the volume ones . So we made them a bit bigger . The mute could possibly be a bit smaller .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nindustrial designer: Hum , you separate off in colour the volume related buttons from the channel related buttons , so you've got the volume in orange on design there ,\nuser interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: and the the channel is in blue .\nuser interface: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: R right . Um ,\nuser interface: Yeah , and we chose a V_ plus and V_ minus .\nproject manager: all these things have cost implications . And so when I done my thing on cost {vocalsound} a {disfmarker} I had assumed that the only uh button that would be a different colour would be the uh the red apple button . So {disfmarker} However , I've now {gap} . {vocalsound} But um , {vocalsound} yeah so uh but there would be a cost implication on that ,\nmarketing: I'll see if I can find them .\nproject manager: and uh {disfmarker} as I suppose that {vocalsound} so whether {vocalsound} wanted to put in all these colours , would be uh open to debate , I suppose .\nindustrial designer: Yeah , sis\nuser interface: Well the colours wouldn't {disfmarker} like that's {disfmarker} they wouldn't be too important ,\nmarketing: Have {disfmarker}\nuser interface: but we didn't have any white Play-Doh . {vocalsound} So that's where the colour buttons came from . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound} An important consideration .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Right , okay so um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} And the second one underneath would be the idea for the {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: Yes , we'll have the slide-away .\nproject manager: Right , okay . So we've got um detail design meeting .\nindustrial designer: Bottom .\nproject manager: Right . So {disfmarker} So , we've got {vocalsound} prototype presentation , which we've just done , evaluation criteria , um and finance , so I guess w we have to evaluate if that meets the various uh aspects that we're looking for uh from um our previous meeting .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So other than the fact that it doesn't have the second layer , but um obviously obviously it would .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound} But other than that , we got the red apple . We got the buttons and the only thing that has really changed is the is the colouration of the buttons ,\nindustrial designer: Yes , yes .\nproject manager: and {vocalsound} the bit after the evaluation criteria is uh is the finance . {vocalsound} And the {vocalsound} and the cost implication .\nindustrial designer: Okay .\nmarketing: Right .\nproject manager: The only snag about this is that uh {vocalsound} the cost is probably kind of important . So um , and then the production evaluation , as to how easy that would be to uh to manufacture .\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: Um , and whether it would uh {disfmarker}\nmarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So if you had to do a presentation or {disfmarker} will you just work it on the prototype ?\nindustrial designer: This this is a {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Uh , that's it . {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: yes , this is our presentation of the prototype .\nmarketing: That's the pr\nproject manager: Right , so uh as far as the the finance of it would be concern would be to make sure that the cost {disfmarker} aye the production cost 'cause you may remember that was one of the first uh considerations was to be in d under um uh twelve fifty or two and a half {disfmarker} uh twelve and a half Euros .\nmarketing: Okay .\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: So , there's no redesign . So that should uh {disfmarker} Right , so , seems to me that the thing that I have to do is is quickly find that uh {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: Could we get this on the board just so we can see {disfmarker} or do you mean do you have the figures there ?\nmarketing: {gap} we should {gap} plug it in .\nproject manager: Right .\nmarketing: Do you wanna plu do you wanna plug it in into the the back of that one .\nproject manager: Okay .\nindustrial designer: 'Kay , Alice . So , sh\nmarketing: We could do it as we d go along , the production costs , looking at the prototype .\nproject manager: Right . {gap} .\nindustrial designer: 'Kay this should be then .\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Okay , so , by the fact that we've got uh the simple chip and the uh kinetic energy source , we've got a single curved case . We've got a rubber uh case materials supplements . So , we had decided that we're having rubber buttons and {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} Have a push button interface .\nproject manager: Okay . W the button supplements .\nindustrial designer: Um {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Well , originally , I thought there would just be uh one in there because it was the one red apple . But {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: Um {disfmarker}\nproject manager: So the so the real w the real question then would come in . Do you make all the buttons {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Well do we'll do it on the prototype ,\nproject manager: O\nmarketing: so do two , see how much it is .\nproject manager: Well , so we've got one special button form , which was the apple . Everything else is gonna be a standard .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: We've got special material , rubber , wood , titanium , et cetera and that ,\nindustrial designer: And then we'd have {disfmarker}\nproject manager: so , I was {disfmarker} {vocalsound} originally , I was thinking {gap} rubber wasn't special ,\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: but according to this , maybe it is .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: {vocalsound} So {disfmarker} And the r I mean effectively we've got sixteen buttons that we're gonna have on there .\nmarketing: Yeah . I think you just do one , don't you , for the {disfmarker}\nproject manager: W {vocalsound} I don't know {vocalsound} is {vocalsound} is {vocalsound} is the sort of answer , is that meant to be all sixteen buttons , and therefore {disfmarker} I mean , what's the op The option was maybe not to have rubber buttons , but just to have the one that was soft and spongy , and therefore {disfmarker}\nmarketing: I think I think it's just it's just a one . Else {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Whereas it would be {disfmarker} the special colour would be for the {disfmarker} So you would only have the one special button that was rubber , whereas the rest would be hard plastic . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I thi I think I think the button supplement i is just a supplement for all the buttons {gap} made in a different material , rather than per button .\nproject manager: Mm .\nmarketing: I don't know though .\nproject manager: I would {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Every design change is uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} sound] I dunno ,\nmarketing: Hmm .\nproject manager: um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay , um , if we just had all the buttons as standard , except for the one red apple , then that would take care of that , I guess . We'd have one special colour and one special button form .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: And when I plugged that in last time {disfmarker} {gap} remember it has to be under twelve and a half . As far as I know , that um {vocalsound} that took care of the uh of the various supplements .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: And if {disfmarker} What happened ?\nmarketing: You've just gone off the window into another one . It's on the bottom row .\nuser interface: Maybe if you just minimise that one in the top right-hand corner of the little box .\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah .\nproject manager: Now , right . {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay , so , but the point would be that if we uh if we just did special {disfmarker} Sorry , you were saying that it would be that one , that you would put in one there .\nmarketing: Yeah . Yeah .\nproject manager: Okay .\nindustrial designer: So that's nine point one there so we've got some {disfmarker}\nproject manager: So it {disfmarker} Well , is it s is {disfmarker} no , it's nine point seven I've got .\nindustrial designer: 'Kay .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: Okay .\nindustrial designer: Just give us a bit of {disfmarker}\nproject manager: So , that would {vocalsound} that would work out fine if uh uh as assuming your correction are are {vocalsound} {disfmarker} assuming that that one change covers all the buttons , then that would be fine .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: And there's nothing else as far as I can see that we we had uh planned to put on {gap} .\nuser interface: S\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I {gap} switching around those th um on the electronics we got the sample sensor . At the moment we've just got the simple chip , which costs one .\nproject manager: Uh-huh .\nindustrial designer: Um , I guess the sample sens sample speaker would be the voice recognition thing , which puts up to four ?\nmarketing: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: We should be slightly over our budget but if we gather something else down to slightly lower standard , and maybe go with the one the special form buttons , then we could have the speech {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: Well , hold on . Um , if we Okay , that gives us twelve point seven\nindustrial designer: So uh maybe if we got rid of like the maybe one of the special colours , kept them all the same colour , then we could have the voice recognition\nproject manager: But remember that the idea was to keep it the colour of the {gap} {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: without {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Oh , I see , so just take out the special colour for the apple and {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: Yeah , yeah .\nuser interface: Um , {gap} . D wouldn't you have to keep the simple chip there as well ? You know how you turn that one to a zero , wouldn't the chip and the sample speaker be separate things ,\nmarketing: Yeah , we have to have it {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: Oh possibly , yeah , yeah maybe .\nuser interface: so you need both of them ?\nmarketing: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Maybe um we'd be giving up on the kinetic . Um {disfmarker}\nproject manager: And go for battery instead .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: That would give you one less .\nindustrial designer: We should {disfmarker} Yeah , that would save us one , though we'd still be slightly ov\nproject manager: But you reckon that i I mean the thing is that you wanted to a appeal to people and not have to replace batteries .\nindustrial designer: Yeah , yeah . Well , since it's the {disfmarker} through the whole technology type thing , um , you were saying in the market research that people like kind of interesting gadgets in them . Um , whether they would figure the {vocalsound} the s uh sample senor and the sample speaker , voice recognition be sort of a worthwhile thing to have .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nindustrial designer: And then still have the batteries ,\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nindustrial designer: or whatever they would prefer not uh {disfmarker} You know what I mean ? The the problem was the battery's running out and losing the um losing the remote .\nproject manager: Mm-hmm .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: So you gotta decide which of those is more important to them .\nproject manager: {vocalsound} But which do you think {disfmarker} or which do we think is the more important of the options ? In a sense , at the moment , we've got a total which we need to reduce down by one point two .\nuser interface: I think the voice recognition .\nproject manager: At least . Remember that was a minimum requirement . The other option if we're planning on just going for something cheap and cheerful , would be to um make it {gap} originally , we're gonna make it a simple product .\nindustrial designer: Yeah ."}, {"chapter": 2, "start_ms": 1122000, "topic": "Evaluation of the prototype against evaluation criteria", "transcript_text": "marketing: Shall we shall we evaluate the prototype as we've got it now first , and then sort of make decisions about what needs to be changed after ?\nproject manager: Mm-hmm . Makes sense .\nindustrial designer: Okay\nmarketing: Okay . Right um , I have a little thing . So , we've all got a note of {disfmarker} it's thirteen point seven , isn't it , with everything we want on .\nproject manager: {gap} . Sorry , do you want that back up ?\nmarketing: Yeah , I just had a presentation to do . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Right .\nuser interface: But I do think uh the v uh voice recognition thing would be more impressive than the fact that it's got no battery .\nproject manager: Okay , but remember the main {disfmarker} the only reason we were planning on having the voice recognition was so that they could find the remote if it got lost .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm . Mm . {vocalsound} Right okay um , This is about the evaluation criteria that we use for the the prototype we've got here .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: And so the method is that the design team makes a prototype , and we evaluate the prototype against some criteria that we've formulated . And those ones are gonna be in response to sort of market research , and also finance , I guess . {vocalsound} And do that on a scale from say true being one and false being seven , so if it's neither true nor false , then that's four . So , I got a set of criteria just based on the marketing that we need to add in a financial one as well , at the end . Um so , We have to say whether it's true or false that the product looks and feels fancy . Um {disfmarker} The {disfmarker} whether the product demonstrates technical innovation . Whether it's easy to use . Whether it's incorporating sort of the fashion element to attract the buyer . And whether it's a sort of recognisable Real Reaction product . And I have to go up onto the whiteboard and do this apparently ,\nindustrial designer: Okay .\nmarketing: so {vocalsound} I'll go over here . {vocalsound} Right . So the first one is um , does the product look and feel fancy . So if we do a sort of a one {disfmarker} So {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: Okay , well we have a single curve , which was {gap} maybe like the feel of the product's quite good .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: So uh {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Okay .\nindustrial designer: Um , then we have the rubber kinda spongy feel , which was in at the time .\nmarketing: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Um , {vocalsound} sorry that'd be considered fancy .\nuser interface: Yeah , I'd maybe give it a a two .\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Of {disfmarker} but I think {disfmarker} What {disfmarker} Is one false , or is t one true ?\nuser interface: One's true .\nmarketing: I forgot . One's true , and okay . Seven's fal\nuser interface: And a four is neutral .\nmarketing: Four is neutral , okay . So {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: So maybe {gap} maybe a two .\nuser interface: Yeah , 'cause we haven't got the double curve , so we can't like say it's completely true .\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Go for one . {vocalsound} Yep .\nmarketing: Right .\nuser interface: {vocalsound} But it's pretty close . We've got almost everything we can .\nmarketing: Okay . Right .\nproject manager: Okay .\nmarketing: I gonna put underneath so I've got some more space . So , false is seven , true is one , and {disfmarker} So uh say about a two for fancy ,\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nmarketing: you think ?\nproject manager: Yeah , why not not ,\nmarketing: Okay .\nproject manager: m m maybe nearer three .\nmarketing: Okay , well d you do an average at the end , I don't know . Um {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Two three . Well , it's just that uh saying something {disfmarker} {vocalsound} remember that when you look down , we've got solar power , we've got uh various other things you could have , and we're not going for these options .\nmarketing: Uh-huh . This this is just this is just for like the look . Does it sort of look fancy rather than functional . So {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah , I suppose that might be in the technical innovation bit .\nmarketing: Yeah , so that {disfmarker} so sh should we go for a a two on that ?\nproject manager: Okay .\nmarketing: 'Kay . And I mean , how much does the product demonstrate technical innovation do you reckon ?\nindustrial designer: Um , {gap} deciding between the kinetic power or um the speech recognition , and if we had either of those for our budget , they both show a reasonable amount of speech recognition .\nmarketing: D yeah . Okay . So , what about the pr The prototype as it is ,\nindustrial designer: Um {disfmarker}\nmarketing: we've got we've got the speech recognition on it , haven't we .\nindustrial designer: But not the kinetic .\nmarketing: But not the kinetic .\nindustrial designer: Like the power .\nproject manager: No . 'Cause you can't afford that {disfmarker} w we took that out too .\nindustrial designer: No , we c ca yeah , we can't afford both .\nmarketing: Alright , so {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Didn't you ? Or {disfmarker}\nmarketing: So it doesn't {disfmarker} It's pretty {disfmarker} The prototype as it is isn't sort of um fulfilling the {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: No may is {disfmarker} maybe about neutral\nuser interface: Maybe a three .\nindustrial designer: plus it it it's got something , but it hasn't got {disfmarker}\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Okay . Yeah .\nproject manager: Well , wait a minute . In thirteen point seven we do have kinetic .\nuser interface: I would give it more than a four .\nproject manager: The problem is we have to reduce down from there to get it down to twelve point five .\nindustrial designer: Right .\nproject manager: And one way of doing that would be to take out the kinetic .\nindustrial designer: Okay .\nproject manager: So , it's very much dependant on what you do with your options . And if you're definitely going for the sample sensor and sample speaker , then {disfmarker} because that {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: 'Kay .\nmarketing: Right , okay .\nproject manager: the other functions we've got in are are more at the {vocalsound} {disfmarker} The special material , the rubber , wood , titanium , et cetera , if you go for that , th that's at the high end 'cause that's point six , whereas down at uh just special colours uh is point two . Now you're trying to lose one point two , so it seems to me that if you're going for the sample sensors {disfmarker} speaker , you're basically then having to go for the cheaper options on everything else .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nindustrial designer: Okay .\nproject manager: And and the simple way to do it would be to have a battery , to have your uh sample sensor speaker ,\nindustrial designer: Um {disfmarker}\nproject manager: and then you're looking to uh take out uh point two ,\nmarketing: S I'm just gonna check my email . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: which would be {disfmarker} come from the button supplements category .\nmarketing: I'm just gonna check exactly what it said in the email for um the product .\nuser interface: How much of a difference would it make if we made the case in plastic ? Because we did say that we don't wanna follow the fashion too much . If the buttons are rubber that might be spongy enough .\nproject manager: Um , interface type um ,\nuser interface: And then it stand the test of time better .\nproject manager: well plastic rather than rubber . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Okay . But I {disfmarker}\nproject manager: That that that would make the significant difference . You could either {vocalsound} you could have it {disfmarker} If you have a in plastic rather than rubber , then that would uh enable you to get {disfmarker} you could keep kinetic then , you could keep your sample sensor , and you'd be looking to take out point two . So you could uh fiddle that down your special form at the bottom , or your special colour at the bottom .\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: And that would enable you to to do it .\nuser interface: Mm-hmm .\nmarketing: Okay .\nindustrial designer: So it says if we make a slightly more fancy , then we lose points innovation , and if we make it more innovative innovative , then we lose points on it being fancy , so {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Yeah .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: Ye\nmarketing: {vocalsound} {gap} , I just read the email again and it sort of says it's evaluate the design sort of as it is , I think , so I think we need to think about finance after we've sort of evaluated that design . I don't know whether we're doing it in the wrong order or something or .\nproject manager: Well , okay , but {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Well , I suppose it's rubber as it is , isn't it .\nproject manager: It's rubber as it is , yes .\nmarketing: So , I mean does this need to go up a bit or something , 'cause we've got both the both the um the speech {disfmarker}\nproject manager: We got {disfmarker} we've we've got thirteen point seven\nuser interface: Yeah .\nproject manager: and we've got it in at the moment and if {disfmarker} and basically , we're going to reduce down from that .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: But the current one , you'd say would be fancy , would be too {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah , yeah .\nmarketing: Yeah . Um , for for innovation , so we've got the speech the speech thing , and {disfmarker}\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . I would've said about a two as well .\nmarketing: Do you reckon a two ?\nuser interface: Yeah , two or three . I'd be happy with a two .\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Okay . Two .\nproject manager: Oh .\nmarketing: And the next one is {disfmarker} I'll have to get it back up now . {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: The next on Well , I can just sing about . Easy to use . I would've said yes . I would go for a one on that at this point in time .\nuser interface: Yeah . Yeah ,\nmarketing: Okay .\nuser interface: I would say so as well .\nproject manager: Um , incorporates elements of fashion to attract buyer . Well , yeah it certainly has some .\nindustrial designer: Um {disfmarker}\nproject manager: {vocalsound} {gap} .\nuser interface: Yeah , it's got the cherry and the sponginess .\nindustrial designer: It does , yeah .\nmarketing: Um {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Yep .\nmarketing: Say about a three maybe ?\nproject manager: I don't know .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah , m um {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Maybe two ?\nindustrial designer: Yeah , it was just doing it quite well .\nproject manager: Yep .\nindustrial designer: Um , I think we're gonna have to lose some of these , but the moment , as it stands , it's um {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Yeah , I woulda said two would seem reasonable .\nmarketing: It's a two .\nproject manager: The product is a recognisable real {disfmarker} r uh {disfmarker} reaction product ?\nmarketing: Yeah , this is {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: Uh {gap} the sensor using all of its all of its products , all of its buttons ,\nmarketing: This {disfmarker}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: and it's got a fairly big label on the bottom saying where it comes from .\nuser interface: Yeah , that's a bit rough at the minute . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} So this is about sort of the corporate image of like new sort of sleek technology and all that sort of thing , as well as having the logo on and all that .\nproject manager: Oh .\nindustrial designer: Okay .\nmarketing: So {gap} sort of {disfmarker} Is it sort of a recognisable product .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Does it fit in with our other other products , which uh are sort of coffee makers and spacecraft . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound} S\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Uh , well it's got the same um speech feature as the coffee machine .\nmarketing: What do y\nindustrial designer: Also it's kind of {gap} spongy rubberiness is maybe bit more kinda comfortable than {disfmarker} kinda sleek and new age .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Um , it depends which way you look at it .\nmarketing: Uh-huh .\nproject manager: Okay . So we're going for a two ,\nmarketing: So {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: Maybe a kind of three ? Uh d\nproject manager: {gap} three ?\nuser interface: Yeah , two or three .\nmarketing: Two or three ?\nuser interface: Well , the logo would be more um recognisable on the actual thing . It's just that the pen wouldn't really write on that paper .\nproject manager: Sure .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: But um , I think the logo would definitely be recognisable .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nuser interface: And it does have attributes that other products do . Two ? Aye . Go for it .\nproject manager: Right , okay .\nmarketing: Two or three . {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Two .\nmarketing: {vocalsound} How {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Right , come on . That's that decided .\nmarketing: Two . Okay .\nproject manager: Right . So {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Right .\nproject manager: So we're now on to changing it to get it to fit in with the budget requirements , and then {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Yeah .\nuser interface: What does {disfmarker} what do all them numbers mean then ? Do we add them up and rate {gap} or anything ?\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah we s yeah , I think we sort of add them up so sort of at an average is gonna be {disfmarker} I'm just gonna do this in my head .\nproject manager: About a two .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Two .\nmarketing: One point eight isn't it or something . {vocalsound} I think , anyway . So yeah , pretty close to a two .\nindustrial designer: Yeah , so it's {disfmarker}\nmarketing: So {disfmarker} So it's {disfmarker} I mean it's pretty good at the moment , but it's gonna get worse , isn't it .\nproject manager: Yep .\nmarketing: But we've gotta try and make sure it doesn't get too bad .\nproject manager: Two b two b two {gap} , yeah .\nindustrial designer: So should we get {disfmarker} So are {gap} definite {disfmarker} Was it {disfmarker} thirteen point seven was the definite price rule if {gap} has .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yes .\nindustrial designer: Okay , so we need to {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Yeah ."}, {"chapter": 3, "start_ms": 2316000, "topic": "Discussion of the prototype in order to fit into the budget", "transcript_text": "project manager: Well , you can lose one point two and still meet the requirements .\nmarketing: Do you wanna plug it into yours so we can get up the the finances {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay , well I put it back on .\nindustrial designer: So I guess this {disfmarker} Is this the last stage once we sort out the finances part of it ?\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I'm not sure .\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {gap} we'll probably have to re-rate it .\nproject manager: Yes , I would've thought so .\nindustrial designer: Yeah , yeah we'll make the adjustments\nmarketing: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: and then see how are rates are going .\nproject manager: Okay , so what was it , control uh F_ eight , wasn't it ?\nuser interface: Ah it's on .\nmarketing: {gap} it's come on already .\nproject manager: Oh . Oh . How kind . {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Right , okay . So , you can see there that the {disfmarker} If you want to keep kinetic , right , you've got a choice there of going down to battery , which would save you one . You've got the sample sensor and and sample speaker , which is your big item .\nindustrial designer: Oh actually we just have a plastic case , then we lose two points ,\nproject manager: That's right .\nindustrial designer: which gets us um {disfmarker} In {disfmarker} right within the budget range .\nproject manager: Which gets you {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Mm .\nproject manager: Yes .\nuser interface: Yeah , I think that'd be fine . Because that was just a trend , and we do have rubber buttons anyway .\nindustrial designer: So that's eleven point seven ,\nmarketing: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: and then we could make sure we definitely had all the button supplements .\nproject manager: Alright .\nmarketing: Different different colours , yeah . Yeah , I was I was thinking that because maybe maybe the sort of rubber case is a bit less in sort of the corporate identity than the sort of you know sleeker plastic case .\nindustrial designer: Possibly , yeah . Um {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Yeah .\nproject manager: Okay , so {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: And that would allow us to have all the technical innovations . So we'd lose a little bit on the {disfmarker} maybe kind of {disfmarker}\nproject manager: So we're going for plastic , yes ?\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Lose a little bit on the fashion , yeah , but {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Yep .\nindustrial designer: Oh yeah , and that would now be {disfmarker}\nmarketing: And then {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: Yeah , that's that's within the budget . Um {disfmarker} Do we actually have {disfmarker} Do we just have one special {disfmarker} uh {gap} special forms down here ?\nproject manager: Well , uh w uh there was debate as to how you would count them . You got special colour .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} Um {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Well originally I was assuming we had the red apple , and therefore , that was the special colour .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} And we we've we've got {disfmarker} we've got enough for another\nuser interface: Yeah , I think we should just imagine white buttons .\nindustrial designer: {disfmarker} we've got nought point eight left ,\nmarketing: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: so we've got enough for another {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Well , we've got special form . Now that would be one button , and the question was was that all buttons or is that just one button . 'Cause our plan really was to have one button only with a special {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: Yeah , um {disfmarker}\nproject manager: So so no matter how you look at that , that would be the same .\nindustrial designer: But the {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} but but the {disfmarker}\nproject manager: The other thing would then be special material , rubber , wood , titanium .\nindustrial designer: I think maybe the special colour , we've got three now just because {gap} the volume buttons are different ,\nmarketing: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: I guess we'd have the ones which are blue at the moment would would just be the standard colour .\nproject manager: Alright . So , special colour , you want three in there .\nindustrial designer: Yeah , which I think we should {disfmarker} Yeah , they'll still be fine for the for the price .\nproject manager: Okay .\nmarketing: Well I thin I think you you you just need two for the special colour 'cause it's just two supplements , you know . One original colour and then sort of two supplements , I think maybe .\nproject manager: {vocalsound} That makes sense .\nindustrial designer: Okay , uh that's probably it .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nmarketing: Okay . So we only ne we only need two for that .\nproject manager: Okay .\nmarketing: 'Cause I mean these these are moulded . The one colour's gonna be moulded out of a piece of plas uh of rubber , isn't it .\nproject manager: Okay . Yeah , I would agree with that , I think . And we've got special form {vocalsound} is the one apple .\nmarketing: Right .\nproject manager: The rest are all standard , although you could argue that should maybe be {disfmarker} You were making these buttons down the bottom , I was presuming , bigger than the other ones , or were you ? Was that the idea ?\nindustrial designer: Ne uh {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Yeah , the volume ones should stand out a bit .\nindustrial designer: Maybe that'll be a second supplement . Then there's a spe a second special form .\nmarketing: Yeah , that {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Uh-huh . I would have thought that's probably about r {vocalsound} well . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Um {disfmarker} Well you got you got twelve .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Okay , so tha\nindustrial designer: So I think that should still be okay . Yeah , that's twelve point three ,\nproject manager: Right .\nindustrial designer: so we're still within budget on that . Um {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Yep , that makes sense .\nindustrial designer: So {gap} decide we've lost a little bit on the fashion and lost a bit on the fancy kinda side of it ,\nproject manager: Yep .\nindustrial designer: but generally speaking , we've kept the other attributes to the {disfmarker}\nproject manager: I woulda said so . Yeah . So you'd maybe put fash fan uh fashion at three rather than two .\nindustrial designer: That's without {vocalsound} {disfmarker} Yeah .\nmarketing: So shall we do a {disfmarker} Well , um {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} And specially it definitely could fits the the real product {disfmarker} What was the {disfmarker} what's the company name ?\nproject manager: Real Reaction produ\nuser interface: Real Reactions ?\nindustrial designer: R yeah . Yeah , yeah .\nproject manager: I'm not quite sure , what does that mean ? {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I mean it still seems definitely fit that p so that's like if that's the new age kind of um inno innovative c type company , then um having the kinetic feature and the voice recognition is p quite high up on {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Yeah , so {disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Yep {vocalsound} I would s\nmarketing: So it's w if we've if we've put in for another special form on a button , then maybe they could be {vocalsound} a different shape . Like we got a cherry one . Maybe other ones could be something else shaped . {vocalsound} I don't know . That would be poss seeing as seeing as it's cheaper to make them a different {disfmarker} {vocalsound} seeing as we've got , you know , we've made it a a special form , so\nproject manager: You mean of {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: Um {disfmarker}\nmarketing: {disfmarker} And that would sort of maybe keep us close on the sort of the fashion type one . And it would sort of , you know , keep it quite fancy as well ,\nproject manager: Well you could argue you might do it once a year , you would change ,\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm .\nmarketing: I don't know .\nproject manager: because at the moment you're making a red apple . So next year you could make {disfmarker} next year's model the same , but have it as a a yeah whate whatever , a lemon .\nindustrial designer: Yeah so it's a {gap} {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Well you could {disfmarker} Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Whatever fruit was in fashion next year . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah , l a lemon lemon or something .\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , I mean the volume buttons could be lemons or something , maybe . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: And that\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: amount {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Okay . So , we've {disfmarker} what have we what have we rid of . We got rid of the plastic .\nproject manager: Yeah , we've {disfmarker} the main thing we've changed really is the casing isn't it ?\nmarketing: Is it {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: That {disfmarker} yeah , that was uh {disfmarker}\nmarketing: The rubber .\nindustrial designer: that was just about all .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: I think we've saved quite a bit because we've just got the push-button interface , which is by far the cheapest .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Um {disfmarker} So maybe in a sense not having that , maybe we've lost some {disfmarker} maybe lost something on the innovation side ?\nmarketing: But uh {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: I dunno . And {gap} that is like the most standard type of button .\nmarketing: So I mean , we've got {disfmarker} we got rid of the rubber case , but we've now s we now sort of got an extra form , and an extra colour for the buttons . So maybe in terms of sort of fanciness and fashionability , we're pretty much the same , maybe .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nmarketing: So , I mean we could maybe put two again on them .\nindustrial designer: And everything else has stayed pretty much the same , so {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Well , ease has certainly stayed .\nindustrial designer: Yeah , plus if anything that is special forms makes it slightly easier to to use .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nmarketing: Yeah . And what about the sort of innovation ?\nindustrial designer: Um , well we've still got the kinetic energy . Um {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Do you think {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Okay .\nproject manager: And the speech feature .\nindustrial designer: Yeah , the speech feature .\nmarketing: {vocalsound} And then , the corporate identity .\nindustrial designer: I think we've cut just about the same . We've maybe lost {disfmarker} Hasn't it {disfmarker} It's hard to tell how the rubber the rubber casing would really affect {disfmarker}\nproject manager: How it would play out , yeah . Oh .\nmarketing: Yeah . Whether whether that's considered to be sort of part of the corporate identity , I don't know . {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Um {disfmarker}\nmarketing: I mean , it's maybe not . I mean {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: But I think more the the features of the actual control will be more important than maybe than the the actual aesthetics , but {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Yeah . Yeah .\nindustrial designer: But either way , I think we've made it fairly close to what {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah . Okay , well I mean {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Yeah , I don't see how we could make it any more . Um , apart from maybe doing the whole thing in the kinda light shade of blue , like the casing .\nmarketing: We cou Mm-hmm .\nuser interface: {vocalsound} But then what colour would you make the R_s ?\nindustrial designer: {gap} just the the company logo . So maybe there's like a set design which we get printed off .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: Well , but you've got the company logo on there , which would effectively be a stick-on badge . So you're {disfmarker} in a sense , you're comparing the product without the company logo .\nindustrial designer: Okay .\nproject manager: And then y but you've got the space for it to stick it on .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Yeah , yeah .\nmarketing: Hey , what what what's the company colour ? Did you get told what the company colour is or {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: I'm still not quite sure we've established that .\nuser interface: No ,\nproject manager: Don't think so .\nuser interface: I just {disfmarker}\nproject manager: But but i but in the sense that , as you saw with um the Windows logo badge , it doesn't really matter .\nuser interface: We got the logo off the web browser .\nmarketing: Oh right .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: There's virtually n The way that you frame , you know , the Windows badge on there , it really doesn't matter what colour it is ,\nmarketing: Hmm .\nproject manager: {gap} so long as our company's logo is framed w in the same way as that with a like a black outline .\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: Fact , they've got black and white or black and silver . So basically , even if you had a silver {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the same colour of silver on your display , because you've got effectively a double edging on the uh on the logo , it means that it splits off what your logo is from the from the product .\nmarketing: Mm . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: And that's actually quite a sneaky way of doing it .\nmarketing: Okay . Uh-huh . 'Cause you've got sort of {disfmarker} we've got point two to play with if you really wanted to .\nproject manager: You could put in another {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Another colour .\nproject manager: Well , in this one , you've actually got three colours of buttons .\nmarketing: Or would that be t\nproject manager: Well , we decided that the blue ones were the um the standard colour .\nmarketing: Yeah . Okay .\nproject manager: So you were talking about uh um {disfmarker} We're assuming that all the buttons on the second panel , the hidden away panel , would all be standard .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: Which m may or may not be the case .\nuser interface: Mm-hmm .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Um {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Shall we save the point two for profitability then ? {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Well , yeah . Bu but but uh was the was there not a button that you were thinking of on the um on the other opt you know , on the second page , as it were , that uh you were thinking of maybe having as a different colour ?\nuser interface: {vocalsound} Um , I don't think they would really need to be . I think if they were just all small round blue buttons , it'd be fine .\nindustrial designer: Yeah , maybe we've m {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Needs to be an enter button , but could just be the same as well .\nindustrial designer: Maybe for the the one they're gonna see all the time , we make it look good , and um , fit the kind of idea of what they want .\nmarketing: Hmm .\nindustrial designer: And then for the more functional buttons , we don't worry too much about that and just have that as like a {disfmarker} plus it's hidden away anyway , you're not gonna see it at the start .\nmarketing: Yeah . I mean it's the sort of thing that , I mean , you wanna pick up the controller and just hit a button quickly to change the channel or volume .\nproject manager: Yeah , well {disfmarker}\nmarketing: So , if it's dead obvious , then that's fine . But if you're opening the panel and you're looking and you're tuning , then you're paying a bit more attention . So it may be sort of different colour buttons isn't so important .\nproject manager: Alright . Okay .\nmarketing: 'Cause you {disfmarker} Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nmarketing: So {disfmarker}\nproject manager: So we just add that to profitability in effect . {gap} {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Yeah , I mean so we've dropped the cost , but {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: Right , so we're meant to finish up in five minutes .\nmarketing: Same sort of function ? The criteria ? It's alright .\nindustrial designer: 'Kay .\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Just made a load of money . {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound} Shouldn't we maybe lose a point on fashion , go to a three ? 'Cause we've lost the overall spongy feel . 'Cause it doesn't seem right that it just hasn't changed at all . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Well , but I think we said that w Because you got rid of the rubber , we put an extra an extra sort of fruit um shape on one of the buttons .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Alright .\nmarketing: {vocalsound} {gap} le lemon sh\nuser interface: Did we decide what that was , which button it was ? On the volume ones ?\nmarketing: I think {disfmarker} well , we could have lemon shaped ones with the volume ones or something . {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound} Right . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} Uh , {gap} . That's good .\nmarketing: Or something like that . Yeah . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Definitely lemon shaped .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Did {disfmarker} did you have to have a rubber case , though , for rubber buttons ? Or was it the other way around ?\nindustrial designer: You had to have rubber buttons if you had the rubber case .\nproject manager: Mm-hmm .\nindustrial designer: So I think we can {disfmarker} we're okay .\nmarketing: Right , okay .\nproject manager: So we're okay this way around .\nmarketing: Yeah . So that {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Until the design team comes in and says , get off .\nmarketing: so we've saved {vocalsound}\nproject manager: But you are the design team . {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Then we say it's fine , so it's all good .\nmarketing: Saved two Euros on that .\nproject manager: So what bit are we on to ?\nuser interface: Um , can I just check if that's a cherry or an apple ? Did we decide against the apple because of Apple Mac ? And did we make it a cherry officially ?\nproject manager: Yeah . I th I th {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: Oh . Right , okay .\nindustrial designer: Just in case we need that point two for lawsuits and such like . {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Oh drats , I've botched that , haven't I .\nuser interface: So were we aiming for a certain target on that scale ?\nmarketing: Well , we're aiming for um one for all of them .\nuser interface: Right .\nmarketing: M but it really has to fit into the budget , so {disfmarker} I guess we just have to adjust things to get it i in the {disfmarker} Which is fair enough . {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: And we seem to have {gap} least something in each criteria . We haven't completely left anything out , so {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Yeah . Yeah , I think\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} As an overall product which has to be quite cheap , we've just about achieved everything .\nmarketing: most {disfmarker} Yeah . Yep .\nuser interface: So do we have anything else to discuss ?\nmarketing: {vocalsound} I don't know . What's on the agenda ?\nproject manager: Right , okay um {disfmarker} What's happened here ? Right , okay um {disfmarker} Mm {vocalsound} . Right , okay um , {gap} {disfmarker} Right . So we got {disfmarker} So we've done the the finance bit and the Excel project and the {disfmarker} We've done the redesign .\nindustrial designer: We've got the closing ."}, {"chapter": 4, "start_ms": 3888000, "topic": "Evaluation of the process of the project", "transcript_text": "project manager: So we're now on to project process . Now satisfaction with , for example , room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , means , et cetera , whiteboard , digital pens , et cetera . So , we're actually now uh , in a sense , on to the evaluation of the course rather than the evaluation of the project is m my understanding of it .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Uh-huh .\nproject manager: So what did you {disfmarker} and remembering that nobody's just over the curtain . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So , um {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Finish your meeting now . {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: We should just go through this quickly and then {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Huh .\nproject manager: So {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: I suppose the easiest way of doing it is to put some notes down , which I will do .\nmarketing: Okay .\nproject manager: So , uh I think I have to finish that page . Right , okay , so {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Oh . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Project evaluation . So , um {disfmarker} Creativity . Did you feel you got a chance to express yourselves {vocalsound} well enough ?\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Um , yeah . Yeah .\nproject manager: Well um {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Yeah .\nmarketing: I thought some of the divisions though between sort of the individual meetings were a bit arbitrary .\nproject manager: Individual meetings . How do you mean ?\nmarketing: Yeah . Well , we were finding out various things in {vocalsound} in be in-between the meetings ,\nproject manager: In you on your own .\nmarketing: and they didn't {disfmarker} the one meeting didn't always follow on for the other one , you know , sort of {disfmarker} we had things thrown in at the second meeting where , you know , you'd looked at the remote controls and seen the curviness , but in the first one you'd also looked at some remote controls and looked at the buttons ,\nproject manager: Um {disfmarker}\nmarketing: and I don't understand why it would be in separate meetings that you'd do that . You know , you'd sort of {disfmarker} you'd probably present it at one or something like that .\nproject manager: Mm , {gap} {disfmarker} The only thing you find is in a manufacturing process , you would {disfmarker} normally , you go to a meeting , you decide , right , you do this , you do that , you do that .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: Then you go away . You find out information . You then come back . You then discuss it . You then go and change things around ,\nmarketing: Uh-huh .\nproject manager: and then go back . So {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: Yeah , I suppose and then {gap} be going out and finding more information each time\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Whereas , this time , you're really getting it from a database source ,\nindustrial designer: and then diff things will be relevant .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: so it's not uh well uh {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: Anyway , so , what do you want to put down ?\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound} I've put , seemed okay . Creativity , seemed okay . Um um flow of information on on any given subject {disfmarker} given subject um sometimes disjointed . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah .\nuser interface: I think it maybe could have been a slightly more creative project . I mean a remote control isn't the most um kind of fancy thing that you could imagine designing .\nmarketing: Yeah , the thing itself .\nproject manager: Um {disfmarker}\nuser interface: I can't think of a better example at the minute .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: Have {disfmarker} could have used a different example {disfmarker} pel to increase {disfmarker} create {disfmarker} Creativity .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Is this go {disfmarker} It kinda kis fits the purpose that it was something everyone knows about and then something we can at least look at and think how we can improve on .\nproject manager: You have to do it within a set time frame is the other thing , so {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Mm-hmm . Yeah . But {gap} think like it was a bit restrictive just to say that you have to design a television remote control , in a way . I mean it depends what sort of business you're in , I guess . I mean this one seems {gap} . From the website it looks {gap} it's quite innovative , but we're coming up with some bucket shop product aren't we\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: that's , you know , fifteen quid . {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {gap} one of those things . Like uh , companies can have like a range of products and {disfmarker}\nproject manager: I th I uh d\nindustrial designer: {gap} I don't know how it works but I guess that something got sent out and {gap} have like a brief to kind of {disfmarker}\nproject manager: But the other thing is that uh they're {disfmarker} I'm guessing that they're trying to use this um software to to demonstrate how you could uh do a project . I mean , m my wife at the moment , for instance , is uh acting as a computer\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: um {vocalsound} for um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you {disfmarker} normally , you got a problem , so you go to your tutor and find out information to see how to get it fixed .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: So what she's doing is she's {vocalsound} having to spend a day at the computer terminal at one end so that any student that comes along can uh ask whatever question . And then you {disfmarker} or the idea is that the {disfmarker} whichever uh person's at the other end can point them in the right direction , show them where to {disfmarker} either give them directly {disfmarker} give them help , or secondly , point them in the right direction , either at the library , or uh or or come back , or go and see Joe Bloggs , or whatever . So uh , and that was a project I suspect similar to this , because they they were actually trying to debug the uh computer software to enable um {disfmarker} to enable it to work . And of course , you had the machine crashing\nmarketing: Hmm .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nproject manager: and various things going wrong . So {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: Well , sh {gap} we look at the last slide ,\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nindustrial designer: see if it's got anything else .\nproject manager: Alright ,\nindustrial designer: {gap} I think there's one one more to go .\nproject manager: so we've got uh\nmarketing: Yeah . {gap} I mean if you look at their products on their website here , Real Reaction , I mean it's all pretty high-tech and cutting edge .\nproject manager: New ideas found ,\nmarketing: And {disfmarker}\nproject manager: did we find any , no .\nindustrial designer: It was quite good with this um {disfmarker} the white board , having that and the digital pens .\nproject manager: Alright .\nindustrial designer: Like , that's something that made it a little easier .\nmarketing: Yeah . Yeah .\nproject manager: Leadership , teamwork .\nmarketing: {gap} we did find a new idea , I mean sort of a kinetic remote control . I've never seen one of them before . {gap} batteries , I think . So {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Does {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: {gap} voice recognition , especially not {gap} could {disfmarker}\nproject manager: You've got voice recognition computers ,\nmarketing: Mm yeah .\nproject manager: that's not remote controls .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nuser interface: Well it's a different application of it .\nproject manager: Mm-hmm . Okay ,\nindustrial designer: Yeah , so it's just like the same products , but just put together in a different way .\nproject manager: so how do you reckon teamwork went ?\nmarketing: Mm .\nindustrial designer: Um {disfmarker}\nmarketing: That went okay , yeah .\nindustrial designer: Yeah , I guess we all had separate ideas and then discussed them .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm , yeah . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: To uh go uh reasonably well . Okay .\nmarketing: {vocalsound} I don't think sort of the budget um allowed us to do anything {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Bit {disfmarker} bit arbitrary . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Well , I mean I don't think it {disfmarker} I just don't think it fitted in with the rest of their products . I mean , they've got all these sort of , you know , high definition D_V_D_ and portable seven inch d um lightweight computer screens ,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm .\nmarketing: and uh I'm thinking , do you know , one cheap remote control doesn't really fit in .\nproject manager: {vocalsound} So , we're m we're meant to comment on leadership and the means , E_ G_ whiteboard , digital pens , et cetera .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Surely they they should produ\nproject manager: And and new i new ideas found was the the other thing .\nuser interface: Well leadership's a bit of a funny one , isn't it .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nuser interface: {vocalsound} But we can't really all fairly comment on leadership because you are the Project Manager .\nproject manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nuser interface: You were the leader . {vocalsound} So our experience of leadership wasn't really as much as yours . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah . Yeah .\nproject manager: Now , I'd much rather be in marketing {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: but {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound} I certainly didn't get this uh computer to work as well as I would have liked .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: However , um {disfmarker} Alright uh means , so whiteboard um {disfmarker} so really , it's uh equipment . Oh .\nmarketing: Yeah . It worked .\nuser interface: Yeah , very nice . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Comput computers could be a bit difficult at times but {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nuser interface: But I mean , I d I don't {disfmarker} I'm not sure I see the value in these . I mean , they record what you're writing , and then what do you do with it ? Where do you get the recording ? Do you plug {gap} the computer or something ?\nmarketing: I think there's a little there's a little um chi\nindustrial designer: So it's not just for us , it's for the experiment as a whole , so {disfmarker}\nmarketing: There's a little there's a little chip , I think you must plug it into something\nindustrial designer: Should we quickly look at the last slide ?\nmarketing: and it produces a {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: Sh {gap} {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Right . I think you watch a video of it kind of .\nmarketing: I don't know . Whether it just produces a big image of sort of everything you've written or something , and {disfmarker} Page after page .\nproject manager: Right . New ideas found , so one or two .\nmarketing: Yeah . Kinetic powered remote control . Um , what was the other one ?\nuser interface: Voice um recognition thing .\nmarketing: Vo yeah .\nproject manager: {gap} um and uh voice\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: uh , was it voice activated um {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Voice recognition , yeah . S\nproject manager: recognition .\nmarketing: Almost .\nuser interface: Pretty much . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound} To fill in these fill in these questionnaires\nproject manager: Right , so , uh are the costs within budget ,\nmarketing: Oh no .\nproject manager: yes . Is the project evaluated , yes . Uh , don't forget to complete final questionnaire and meeting summary . Then celebration . {vocalsound}"}]}
