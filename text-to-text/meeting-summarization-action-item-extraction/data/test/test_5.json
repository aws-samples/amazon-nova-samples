If you're using an advanced function right , like um c brightness , contrast , whatever , it will just say {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Right . Okay .\nindustrial designer: You know it's like it only has four columns , it's a very simple L_C_D_ like , whereas many {disfmarker} the minimum amount we need that the user will automatically know like this is brightness or this is contrast .\nmarketing: Right .\nproject manager: Mm-hmm . Okay cool .\nmarketing: Right , 'kay .\nindustrial designer: It might even be one , a bit more complex L_C_D_ panel with pictures like maybe the sun or the , you know , the the symbols of the various functions .\nmarketing: Okay\nproject manager: Oh right okay .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm , and what is this here ?\nproject manager: Cool .\nindustrial designer: That's a number pad .\nmarketing: Okay so the number pad is {disfmarker} 'Kay , great .\nproject manager: Where are we gonna have the slogan ?\nindustrial designer: Um they're al along this {disfmarker}\nuser interface: You know , just like right inside there .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nproject manager: Okay cool .\nindustrial designer: You have this space here , and then you have this thing on the side as well , or at the bottom .\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: 'Cause slogans are usually quite small , right ,\nproject manager: Okay .\nindustrial designer: they're not like huge\nmarketing: Mm .\nindustrial designer: so they're s\nmarketing: Yep .\nindustrial designer: Say a button's about\nproject manager: Okay .\nmarketing: Looks good .\nindustrial designer: say a button's about this size , right , so you would still have plenty of space for a slogan , say even for that .\nmarketing: Yep . {vocalsound} Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: So if this isn't to scale , what kind of dimensions are you thinking about here ?\nuser interface: {vocalsound} Well {vocalsound} we want the other buttons to be big enough to push easily with a finger\nproject manager: Mm-hmm .\nuser interface: so we reckon maybe that'll be about the same size as the palm of your hand . {gap}\nmarketing: Okay .\nindustrial designer: Yep so that would be about a centimetre for a button , so one two three four centimetres . Plus maybe half o five\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nindustrial designer: six seven eight ,\nmarketing: About nine in total .\nproject manager: Six , seven , eight , nine , ten .\nindustrial designer: about yeah nine total .\nproject manager: So we're talking about ten centimetres .\nmarketing: That sounds good . Yeah .\nproject manager: That would be good . So ten centimetres in height .\nmarketing: Yep .\nindustrial designer: Nine , ten . Yep .\nproject manager: Okay um {vocalsound} .\nmarketing: That'd be good , in fact a pen is about ten centimetres usually , so that would be {disfmarker} that sounds like a really good size , if you see it there .\nproject manager: Yeah . That's great and it's very bright as well . So um okay .\nmarketing: Mm . Is it possible {disfmarker} uh I'm just gonna bring up the idea of colours . Is these are these the colours that {disfmarker} of production , or is this just what we had available ?\nuser interface: Well I'm {disfmarker} We're gonna have again the the sort of the foggy um yellow from last time that lit up when you pushed the button .\nmarketing: Right .\nproject manager: Okay so just {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Um {disfmarker}\nproject manager: could you just list all the things that it does s so I can write them in the report .\nuser interface: But um {vocalsound} this button um , because it's red it's sort of very prominent , we're gonna use it as uh {disfmarker} it can be the power button if you hold it for maybe two seconds it'll send a stand-by signal .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} Excuse me .\nproject manager: Mm-hmm .\nuser interface: Um apart from that it's gonna be used as a confirm button for the L_C_D_ screen\nindustrial designer: Sure .\nproject manager: Okay .\nuser interface: and you use this as a jog-dial .\nproject manager: Okay so that's like an okay button , right .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nindustrial designer: Oh we've discussed how h high it is , but how wide is it ? {vocalsound}\nuser interface: I don't know . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay .\nmarketing: How high is it ?\nindustrial designer: No as in the height , but what about the width ?\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: Oh oh\nuser interface: Didn't put five centimetres .\nproject manager: like depth of the actual thing .\nindustrial designer: Do we need five ? I don't think five is {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Um .\nindustrial designer: be about th three and a half .\nmarketing: Okay .\nproject manager: Oh is this k to get an idea of scale from your from your thing there okay .\nuser interface: Something by there .\nindustrial designer: Yeah , yeah .\nmarketing: Sure .\nproject manager: So you can power on and off , what else can you do ?\nmarketing: Three and a half .\nuser interface: Um you can skip straight to a channel using these buttons .\nproject manager: Okay .\nuser interface: Um , were gonna have the volume control here , but um because we've got the the L_C_D_ and the jog-dial we just thought we'd um use that as the volume .\nproject manager: Okay jog-dial for volume . And what else do you do with the jog-dial ?\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nuser interface: Um you can use it for um more advanced functions like contrast , colour and {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Contrast , brightness ,\nuser interface: Um yeah .\nproject manager: yeah , and anything else ?\nuser interface: Um just whatever else we wanted to include as the advanced functions , um we didn't actually go through and specify the {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Well of the designers what are they ?\nuser interface: Uh what can a T_V_ do ?\nindustrial designer: Okay things like um brightness , contrast ,\nproject manager: Uh-huh .\nindustrial designer: um maybe tuning the channels .\nproject manager: Okay channel tuning .\nindustrial designer: Um .\nproject manager: That's a good one .\nindustrial designer: What else ? Um the various inputs . Are you having a V_C_R_ , are you having {disfmarker} you know which input do you have ?\nmarketing: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nproject manager: Okay auxiliary inputs .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm ,\nindustrial designer: Um .\nmarketing: probably colour or sharpness .\nindustrial designer: Yep , colour , sharpness . Um a lot of these things will have to be um free and open for users to define them .\nproject manager: Sharpness . Okay what about uh sound settings\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: ? Uh d can you change any of those at all ?\nmarketing: Audio .\nindustrial designer: Audio , we have like your basic y your base , your mid-range , your high range .\nuser interface: Um .\nindustrial designer: Um .\nuser interface: {gap} the the balance hmm .\nindustrial designer: Yep , left-right balance , um maybe even pre-programmed sound modes , like um the user could determine like a series of sound modes ,\nproject manager: Okay .\nindustrial designer: and then what could happen would be um when you click on that then it would go to that setting .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: Okay ,\nmarketing: Mm 'kay .\nindustrial designer: Yeah ."}, {"chapter": 2, "start_ms": 864000, "topic": "Excel sheet and price listing", "transcript_text": "project manager: is there anything else at all it can do ? That {disfmarker} 'cause that's that's fine . Just need to know so I can write it down . Okay um right I g I guess that's it , so we can now um {vocalsound} {disfmarker} We can now have a little look at the the Excel sheet and price listing , and see if we need to um if we need to rethink anything at all .\nuser interface: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: So um for this first part here power-wise , have we got battery ?\nindustrial designer: The battery .\nproject manager: Do we have kinetic as well ?\nindustrial designer: No .\nproject manager: No . Okay ,\nindustrial designer: Um .\nproject manager: just battery .\nindustrial designer: We need an {disfmarker}\nproject manager: And that's because of cost restraints is it ?\nindustrial designer: Yep .\nproject manager: Okay\nuser interface: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Yeah advanced chip .\nproject manager: um what about the electronics here ?\nindustrial designer: We need an advanced chip I think , yep .\nproject manager: Advanced chip .\nindustrial designer: Let me just confirm that . Yes I think so . Yep .\nproject manager: Okay um the case , what does it mean by single and double , do you know ?\nuser interface: Um I think single would just be sort of one sort of oval whereas double is this sort of thing .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nproject manager: So we want double-curved ?\nindustrial designer: Yep .\nproject manager: Okay . Um .\nindustrial designer: Plastic .\nproject manager: Is there any rubber at all in the buttons or any\nindustrial designer: I think we're gonna have to skip the rubber .\nproject manager: Okay ,\nindustrial designer: Um .\nproject manager: um and we wanted special colours didn't we ?\nindustrial designer: Yep .\nproject manager: So I'll have to put that {disfmarker} Oh no wait we {disfmarker} ho how many colours have we got there ?\nindustrial designer: For the case itself , one colour . It's one special colour .\nproject manager: Just one colour , okay .\nindustrial designer: 'Cause the case unit itself , the rest of our components go on top of it .\nproject manager: Okay so interface-wise , is it this third option we have , the two of them there ?\nmarketing: Mm .\nindustrial designer: Yes . One and the L_C_ display .\nproject manager: Okay and then buttons , we have what , two colours ?\nindustrial designer: How many {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Um we have um got some push buttons as well .\nmarketing: Or even clear .\nindustrial designer: We've got push buttons as well .\nproject manager: Like uh oh wait so push button and integrated scroll wheel push\nuser interface: 'Kay .\nproject manager: okay .\nuser interface: So I reckon we've got one button for this thing 'cause it's just one big sheet of rubber .\nproject manager: Uh-huh .\nuser interface: I'm not sure if that counts but {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: Okay let's just be safe and put like say four buttons for that one .\nproject manager: Okay . Okay .\nindustrial designer: Okay um and maybe a special colour for the buttons , so maybe four again .\nproject manager: Four .\nuser interface: You can see we're we're all very far beyond the {disfmarker}\nproject manager: So w why are we arriving at the number four ? Where does the number four come from ?\nindustrial designer: 'Cause that's one button by its the complexity of twelve buttons .\nproject manager: Okay right ,\nindustrial designer: So we're just estimating that yeah it would be less .\nproject manager: so we're writing down four . {vocalsound} Okay . How about these ? Are we wanting them in {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: No .\nproject manager: no they're just {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: Yep .\nproject manager: is everything gonna be plastic ?\nindustrial designer: Yep .\nproject manager: Okay . So we're w w quite far over .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Now we're gonna {disfmarker} something's gonna have to go . Um we're at sixteen point eight and {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Uh how mm-hmm {disfmarker} how are we going to achieve this high-end product if {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Well we h something has to go to the tune of two point t three Euro ,\nmarketing: We only have very sparse {disfmarker}\nproject manager: so let me see , what are we {disfmarker} I mean {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Two point three ? Four point three no ?\nproject manager: oh yes sorry , four point three . My maths is all out .\nuser interface: Well we could take out ones by making it single curved , just fill in those bits .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: How much would that save us ?\nmarketing: And then where is the {disfmarker}\nproject manager: How much would that save us ?\nindustrial designer: That will only save you one .\nuser interface: That is one .\nindustrial designer: The other thing could be that um you could take away the L_C_D_ panel and the advanced chip together ,\nproject manager: One .\nindustrial designer: um because when you do something on the T_V_ , the T_V_ responds and reacts as well ,\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nindustrial designer: so the user could be looking at the T_V_ and pushing his thing so we may not need to {disfmarker}\nuser interface: That's fair enough , yeah .\nindustrial designer: so when we scroll we need just some way to get the T_V_ to respond ,\nmarketing: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nindustrial designer: which I think is a technically doable thing so {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Okay so {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: So w what's our reviewed suggestion ?\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Um take away the L_C_ display ?\nindustrial designer: Yep . And the advanced chip goes away as well .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: To be replaced with a\nindustrial designer: Regular chip .\nproject manager: regular chip .\nindustrial designer: Yep . So what that means is that um {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Okay .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: {vocalsound} And so we've got point three to get rid of . Um and we ha where are the four {disfmarker} the four push buttons are where exactly now ?\nindustrial designer: The twelve buttons that you see there {vocalsound} .\nproject manager: Twelve buttons .\nuser interface: That's um one piece of rubber but it's gonna have twelve button things underneath so {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Functionally you're gonna have to intercept {disfmarker} So four is a good estimate for {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Do you think ?\nindustrial designer: Yeah , so you can't actually cut {vocalsound} {disfmarker} It's like three times the number of buttons , four , eight , twelve .\nproject manager: Like is is that one big button or is it twelve buttons ,\nindustrial designer: It {disfmarker} It needs to be more than one big button because if you open up your phone , underneath there's actually one button underneath , it's just that the panel itself is a single panel .\nproject manager: how can it be something in between ?\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: Mm . Okay\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: well we have point three to get rid of somewhere .\nindustrial designer: We just report that it has to be over budget {vocalsound} ,\nproject manager: Mm .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: or the colours , you could take away s colours for th for the buttons .\nproject manager: No can do .\nmarketing: Yeah we could just go with um {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Yeah w\nindustrial designer: Normal coloured buttons .\nproject manager: Well do you want colour differentiation here ?\nindustrial designer: No that's not the button we're talking about .\nuser interface: Um {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: That's {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Oh yeah sorry yeah then . {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: the buttons only refer to the pad so {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Right so {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: Should we take that off uh ?\nproject manager: Ah .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Hey it's back to the original .\nproject manager: That's it .\nmarketing: Hmm .\nindustrial designer: Um so then these just become normal coloured buttons , so that might be some some way of cutting the cost .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm . Mm .\nproject manager: Okay , ach that's a shame . {vocalsound} Um right , so take away that completely ? Ah . And now we're under budget . So we do have point five Euro to play with if we wanted .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound} So I reckon {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Um {disfmarker}\nmarketing: How about with embossing the logo , isn't that going to cost us some money ?\nproject manager: Doesn't say so . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah . That's a freebie .\nuser interface: Reckon that probably counts as a special form for the buttons .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nproject manager: Yeah that's a good idea . Just one ? Does that mean that one button has a special form or {disfmarker}\nuser interface: I think {gap} there's just one button so\nproject manager: Yeah okay .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: handy {vocalsound} .\nproject manager: Well well there we go . So I'm just gonna have to redraw this now . So we're not gonna have the L_C_D_ anymore , and we'll just gonna have an on t on the T_V_ it'll show you what you're doing , which I think is fair enough , and so this is gonna be one big thing here . Um .\nmarketing: Was the goal in your in your prototype design that it be as low profile as possible ?\nindustrial designer: What do you mean by profile ?\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Sort of flat as possible .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: No .\nuser interface: You see I envision it as being um quite deep\nmarketing: Yeah .\nuser interface: sort of {vocalsound} deep enough to be comfy to hold in your hands rather than being wide and flat .\nmarketing: Yeah that's what I was thinking , to\nindustrial designer: We didn't have enough Play-Doh to make it three D_ . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Sure , okay . Yeah alright yeah fair enough .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Okay , just thought I'd ask .\nindustrial designer: So there's one more dimension to the thing which we need to to add ,\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nindustrial designer: and you might want to add in the report , length , width , and height .\nproject manager: Right okay .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nproject manager: So just to well to be thorough then , width-wise we're looking at about what three centimetres or something ?\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nproject manager: Okay and then so height-wise {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Hmm .\nproject manager: How how tall do you envisage it being ? About that big ?\nindustrial designer: Two .\nuser interface: Yeah it works , yeah .\nproject manager: About two centimetres , okay .\nmarketing: Two's not very high at all though .\nindustrial designer: This is about this is about two .\nmarketing: Maybe a bit higher ?\nindustrial designer: Slightly more than two , so {disfmarker}\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nuser interface: See , about that thick .\nproject manager: Okay . Ach , that is {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Maybe closer to three even or two and a half .\nindustrial designer: Okay .\nproject manager: Yeah . Okay we'll s we'll say two point five . Okay um so we have it within cost anyway . Um so yeah project evaluation is this point . Um .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: Right uh . Okay so can we close that ? This is what it's {disfmarker} the final spec that it's gonna be . Someone is gonna have to {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: yeah that's fine that's fine .\nmarketing: Um it's probably just {disfmarker} I dunno if it's worth getting into , but um just in in that we want this to be stylish , should we think a little bit more out of the box in terms of a button grid , because I've seen there's lots of devices out there that that instead of taking your standard nine nine square grid , and they have it sort of stylized or in different concept that that {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: I think that's something that's very hard to catch ,\nmarketing: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: so you you restrict the number of people who wanna try something .\nmarketing: Sure , okay .\nindustrial designer: The the look and the colour is something which is cool ,\nmarketing: Yeah , alright .\nindustrial designer: but I think that there's also that factor of if it's too unfamiliar\nmarketing: Okay , sure .\nindustrial designer: then um {disfmarker} because when you put it on the shelf {disfmarker}\nmarketing: What about button shape ? Square buttons ?\nindustrial designer: Yeah button shape might be a good idea to change , rather than rather than positioning ,\nmarketing: Okay .\nindustrial designer: 'cause I think positioning is {disfmarker} we're kinda engrained into the the telephone kind of\nmarketing: Yeah . Sure .\nuser interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Okay .\nindustrial designer: pad .\nproject manager: Right um . So at this point we uh , let me see , discuss uh how satisfied we all are with um with these four points , with the room for creativity in the project , and leadership and teamwork , and the stuff we had around us I guess .\nmarketing: Mm 'kay .\nproject manager: Um , let me see uh {disfmarker}"}, {"chapter": 3, "start_ms": 2184000, "topic": "Evaluating the current design", "transcript_text": "marketing: Do you want me to d um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Do you want me to do my um design evaluation last ?\nindustrial designer: Maybe we should do the design evaluation first .\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Yeah I wasn't really sure what that was {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Or {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Yeah\nmarketing: Evaluation .\nproject manager: , yeah go for that first . I wasn't entirely sure what uh {disfmarker} who was supposed to be doing that ,\nmarketing: Okay .\nproject manager: but y you go for it .\nmarketing: Sure . Um , alright so the way this works , I'm gonna need to plug into PowerPoint ,\nproject manager: {gap} Okay .\nmarketing: I'll try and do it as quick as possible .\nproject manager: Okay .\nmarketing: Um , this is um {disfmarker} I'll just go over your head if that's okay .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: I don't think you need the power ,\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: so {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nmarketing: What's that ?\nindustrial designer: No , that's okay that's okay .\nmarketing: I don't need the PowerPoint ?\nindustrial designer: No , the power cord itself .\nmarketing: Oh {gap} course ,\nindustrial designer: Yeah , so then you have a bit more freedom to {disfmarker}\nmarketing: yeah that's true . Let me get that . A bit more .\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Okay ,\nindustrial designer: You you still have your blue fingers .\nmarketing: so what this is is a set-up for us to um uh use a kind of a like a {disfmarker}\nuser interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Is it ?\nindustrial designer: You killed a monster .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: The idea is that I've set up {disfmarker} I've reviewed all of the um the points of discussion from the beginning , and used that as a criteria of evaluation for the um uh for the current design uh th or the plan , and uh so we can review that . Uh I think it's gonna end up being sort of elementary because we're sort we're in n we're not gonna probably use it to change anything but {disfmarker} Doesn't seem like it's going , does it ?\nproject manager: Oh there it is .\nmarketing: Yeah , okay great . Uh and I'm gonna write up our results on the board , so this'll be a way for us to go through and decide if we're um {disfmarker} sort of review where we stand with it . Okay , so um {disfmarker} So to sort of b bring together two things , sort of design goals and also the market research that we had , uh when we rate this , one is v high in in succeeding or fitting to our original aim and seven is low ,\nproject manager: Mm 'kay .\nmarketing: okay . So these i these i th are the {disfmarker} and um we've been asked to uh to collectively rate this , so what we can do is try and just y work on a consensus system so we just come to an agreement .\nproject manager: Okay .\nmarketing: Okay ? So the first one uh , stylish look and feel .\nindustrial designer: I rate that pretty highly .\nproject manager: Well yeah , I mean compared to most remote controls you see that's pretty good .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: I dunno like a six or something .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: What does anybody else think ?\nmarketing: Yeah um me uh my only reservation with it was that we basically went with yellow because it's the company's colour ,\nproject manager: Mm .\nmarketing: and I don't know if yellow's gonna really be a hit .\nproject manager: Mm .\nmarketing: But {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay .\nuser interface: I'm seeing five then .\nmarketing: What do you guys think ?\nproject manager: I would say five or six .\nmarketing: Okay .\nindustrial designer: Yep I'm fine with that .\nproject manager: David ?\nmarketing: Okay let's go with five then .\nproject manager: Okay .\nmarketing: Fi oh uh just actually the opposite .\nindustrial designer: It's one to seven , right ?\nproject manager: Oh yes\nmarketing: The {disfmarker}\nproject manager: sorry then"}, {"chapter": 4, "start_ms": 2574000, "topic": "Evaluating the project", "transcript_text": "marketing: So it meant three ,\nproject manager: , then I would say two or three .\nmarketing: okay .\nindustrial designer: Wait , what's the scale , one to seven , right ?\nproject manager: Yeah .\nmarketing: Yeah , one is high .\nuser interface: One's high-ish isn't it ? Ah , okay so yeah , two or three .\nmarketing: 'Kay {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Okay , it's upside-down .\nmarketing: Let's go with two point five then .\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Okay , um {vocalsound} control {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: high tech innovation .\nproject manager: Well it has the wee jog-dial\nmarketing: We had to remove {disfmarker}\nproject manager: but {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Yeah , so we've had to remove a few of our features we wanted ,\nproject manager: Mm .\nmarketing: but jog-dial\nindustrial designer: Say it's more\nproject manager: I'd go with three or four ,\nmarketing: 's good .\nuser interface: Eight\nindustrial designer: medium ,\nproject manager: maybe three .\nuser interface: three .\nindustrial designer: but going towards a little bit higher than medium kind of thing .\nmarketing: Okay ,\nproject manager: Yeah about three , okay .\nmarketing: three ?\nindustrial designer: Yep .\nmarketing: Okay , um {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Style reflects a fruit inspired colour , design .\nindustrial designer: Lemon .\nmarketing: I shouldn't have said colour , but just {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: Okay , the blue the blue colours and {disfmarker} don't re don't actually represent the colour ,\nproject manager: Well that's kind of {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Sorta .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: except for the b the the red button ,\nmarketing: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: they {disfmarker} because for want of a {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Okay .\nproject manager: But the yellow , I mean it could be a lemon yellow colour ,\nmarketing: Right . Yeah , could be . Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Yeah , the the yellow is more representative of the colour ,\nproject manager: couldn't it ?\nindustrial designer: but the button itself , the blue can be anything else .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nmarketing: Okay . Okay so we'll go two .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Mm-hmm .\nmarketing: Yeah ? Okay , and um design is simple to use , simple in features .\nproject manager: Well yeah , I mean it's really basic looking isn't it ?\nmarketing: F f yeah f fairly basic ,\nproject manager: I mean I'd give that nearly a one .\nmarketing: you guys think ?\nuser interface: Yeah {gap} one .\nindustrial designer: Yep , that's fine .\nmarketing: Yeah , one ? Okay . {vocalsound} Um , {vocalsound} soft and spongy , have we achieved that ? We've used mostly plastic in the end so it's going to be quite a bit of a compromise for price .\nuser interface: Yeah I think it's about five .\nmarketing: Five ?\nproject manager: Five ? That's really low .\nuser interface: {vocalsound} Yeah well we have to use uh plastic\nproject manager: Yeah I suppose mm 'kay .\nmarketing: That's {disfmarker}\nuser interface: so it's probably gonna be {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Um\nindustrial designer: Yeah , company logo .\nmarketing: could we have used an entirely rubber frame to it ? Was that an option ?\nindustrial designer: I think it'll be cost prohibitive ,\nuser interface: I think I'd probably increase the cost .\nmarketing: It would cost more than plastic .\nuser interface: We've only got {vocalsound} like what , ten cents left so {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: yeah .\nmarketing: Okay , logo , we've got it in there , haven't we ?\nindustrial designer: Yep .\nproject manager: Yep . Gonna have that on the side , aren't we , like there or something ?\nmarketing: Huh . And um it's within budget , yep . It is , isn't it ?\nuser interface: Yeah .\nmarketing: Okay , so we can say then that uh out of a possible {disfmarker} or what would be our goal here ?\nproject manager: Out of forty nine , I guess .\nmarketing: Yeah , out of forty nine with with zero being the highest . We are at uh two , seven , eight , ten , fifteen point five .\nproject manager: 'S pretty good .\nmarketing: So it's pretty good . Translates to something like about approximately seventy two percent efficacy of our original goal . Right ?\nproject manager: Uh yeah .\nmarketing: I think 'cause if you turn that into a hundred it would be about\nproject manager: Twice that ,\nmarketing: about thirty one ,\nproject manager: about thirty one .\nmarketing: and then invert that , it's {disfmarker}\nproject manager: So yeah ab well yeah about sixty nine , seventy percent yeah .\nmarketing: Oh right , about seventy , yeah seventy percent .\nproject manager: It's pretty good .\nmarketing: Okay , good . That was just a little formality for us to go through .\nproject manager: Okay .\nmarketing: Yep , oh hundred pound pen . {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Sorry {vocalsound} {vocalsound} alright .\nproject manager: Nobody saw it , honestly . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound} No .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} The cameras did . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Hmm .\nproject manager: Is that you all have all finished , or {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Yeah that's that's me . I did have one other um one other frame I thought , I mean I I d not knowing how we would deal with this information , I thought okay in theory this kind of a process would be about refining our design , revisiting our original goals .\nproject manager: Uh-huh .\nmarketing: It's not something I need to p push through , but I thought should we thinking more about the dimensions , um sort of like more of a three dimensional shapes as well as opposed to just that flat um {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Mm-hmm .\nmarketing: Could our design involve a series of colours so that it's more of like a line where we have like sort of the , I don't know like the harvest line or the vibrant ,\nindustrial designer: Yep .\nmarketing: I dunno the {gap} {disfmarker} Whatever just some theme and then we have different tones , lime green , lemon .\nproject manager: Okay .\nmarketing: It's just discussion . I mean obviously we can just abandon this , it's fine . I'm just thinking about what we originally set out to do .\nproject manager: Right .\nmarketing: Um , yep so there . That's all .\nproject manager: Okay , great um are you submitting the the um evaluation criteria or am I ? I don't know what your instructions have been .\nmarketing: Um , I think to record it and uh I haven't been asked to submit it yet .\nproject manager: Okay ,\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: uh just wondering if I need to include it in the minutes ,\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: because if you're submitting it anyway then {disfmarker}\nmarketing: I will , yeah .\nproject manager: Okay great .\nindustrial designer: It keeps getting too big .\nproject manager: Cool . Um right , uh well next up then , because we've done finance , is the project evaluation .\nindustrial designer: 'Kay I'm I'm listening I'm just trying to incorporate the logo into the the thing , so I'm playing with the Play-Doh as well .\nproject manager: Oh right , okay .\nuser interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Just in case you're wondering {vocalsound} , why is he still playing with the Play-Doh ? {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Huh .\nindustrial designer: Just about right\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: L_E_G_O_ Lego {vocalsound} . {gap}\nuser interface: My leg . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Right , okay . Um well do you wanna um just individually say what you think about about these four points and {vocalsound} {disfmarker} or not those four points , my four points , sorry , forgotten that . {vocalsound} You got a different uh {disfmarker}\nmarketing: {gap}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {gap}\nmarketing: Yep . I like those printer cables that just have the two little butterfly clips like that .\nproject manager: Oh yeah , they're good aren't they , yeah .\nmarketing: It's really quick .\nproject manager: Right okay ,\nmarketing: To use .\nproject manager: um yeah here we are . Uh as a note we'll do this alphabetically . {vocalsound} Um do you wanna start Andrew ?\nmarketing: Sure , um so what is it you're asking of me now ?\nproject manager: I don't know , just um your opinion on those four those four points really and how we used them .\nmarketing: Or sort of our work on setting this up .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nmarketing: Yeah . Well , is it {disfmarker} uh okay I'll just go through your system then . The the room uh is fairly institutional , but um the main thing is , I think um our use of this space is more just to report on things as opposed to be creative and constructive and it would probably help to um have l sort of a cumulative effect of we have ideas and we come back and then the ideas are still in discussion , you know ,\nproject manager: Uh-huh .\nmarketing: as in other words this this room is sort of a centre point of creativity , whereas in reality as we've gone through this , it's not really the centre point of creativity , it's more just a\nproject manager: Well d do you feel though that that you were able to have quite a lot of creative input into the thing ?\nmarketing: d debating {disfmarker} Yeah , yeah but that's just the thing is the quest in terms of the the first point there , the room , it feels as though the creativity goes on when we leave , and then we come here and then we kind of put out our ideas and then , you know .\nproject manager: But I don't I don't think it means the room as in this room . I think it means like you know {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Oh , oh right right , oh right okay room for creativ\nproject manager: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Oh right I just looked up and saw okay whiteboard , digital pens , the room .\nproject manager: Room . Oh yeah . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: No , of course , yeah .\nproject manager: Well I dunno do you th I think it means um I think it means did you feel you were able to give creative input so {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Sorry . Huh . Yeah . Yeah I th okay on th um yeah dif answering the question uh in those terms I'd say that actually there's sort of a tease of creativity because we're asked to work through this , but actually the guidelines are fairly contrived in terms of um okay fashion trends , say fruit and vegetable colour scheme ,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm .\nmarketing: but then i then we're told okay use the co company company colours .\nproject manager: Mm .\nmarketing: So what do we do . We're told okay um think in terms of style and look and feel and technology , but build something for twelve and a half pounds ,\nproject manager: Okay .\nmarketing: so actually the creativity was more more of like a um a f sort of a f formality then an actual {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: You feel like you're caged within whatever y\nproject manager: Okay .\nmarketing: Yeah within the constraints\nindustrial designer: It's like a balloon in a cage , it can only go so big and not hit the side .\nmarketing: the {disfmarker}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: The constraints do come in very fast .\nproject manager: Okay uh do you know what ,\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah , yeah .\nproject manager: actually let's take each point and everybody discuss it , I think .\nmarketing: So {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Yeah .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: So still on the topic of room for creativity uh next up is Craig .\nuser interface: Um I agree with his point it's um it is quite a lot of fun t to go and then you have sort of hit the end then go right , gotta cut everything out 'cause we don't have enough money .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nmarketing: Yep .\nindustrial designer: I think another point is that the meetings um are more brainstorming sessions than meetings ,\nmarketing: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: so time is also a very s um strong factor , and structure .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Because for a brainstorming meeting you want a structure that allows you to {disfmarker} allows ideas to get tossed , um to be evaluated , and to be reviewed , and to get feedback and come back .\nproject manager: Mm .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . {vocalsound} Yeah , yeah .\nindustrial designer: And I guess that point about the room not being r very friendly to that , I think that's a very big thing ,\nmarketing: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: and I think the fact that we're wearing these things restricts {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Yeah , sure .\nindustrial designer: I feel it 'cause I wear m my glasses , right , and that but that irritates me right\nproject manager: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: it it it does actually you know affect how , w whether you feel comfortable to communicate .\nmarketing: Yeah . New creativity .\nindustrial designer: I feel like I'm hiding behind the equipment , rather than the equipment is helping me , and you know .\nmarketing: Yep .\nproject manager: So you think a more relaxed atmosphere would be more kind of conducive to creative thought or {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Right .\nindustrial designer: Not not so much an atmosphere , the atmosphere is very relaxed , but the the gear\nproject manager: Yeah , but actual environment ?\nindustrial designer: yeah you know that creates boundaries to that um\nmarketing: Mm .\nindustrial designer: and and the time the time given also restricts {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Okay .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: Okay .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: Very good . Um what about leadership ?\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I don't know if that means like , if I did a good job or something .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I don't really know .\nmarketing: Yeah , well well I mean my sense on that is sort of what kind of guidance and direction , encouragement {disfmarker}\nproject manager: From like your personal coach person and stuff like that , do you think maybe ?\nmarketing: Yeah from {disfmarker} and you as well I think , just sort of acting as team leader .\nproject manager: Okay .\nmarketing: Um yeah I think I think it's\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} Excuse me .\nmarketing: I think it's good . I mean my personal views on on leadership is that effective effective leadership sort of um gives people a certain room for freedom and delegation , but then to come back with something that they take great ownership and\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Mm-hmm .\nmarketing: you know , innovative thought with . In in reality I think here the the different elements of leadership such as the the original b briefing and then the personal coach and the and then you know having having you with your {disfmarker} the meeting agenda is actually quite a quite a {vocalsound} quite a con confining framework to work within . And so it is leadership almost to the point of sort of disempowering the the the team member , so {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Uh-huh , okay .\nmarketing: But it's not bad leadership , it's just sort of s fairly strong , you know . It turns it turns the individual into more of like a um sort of a predetermined mechanism , as opposed to a sort of a free {disfmarker}\nproject manager: So you think maybe a little too controlling or {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah , oh yeah , without without a doubt .\nindustrial designer: I think controlling is not the right word , I think the interactions are very structured .\nmarketing: Yeah maybe not co confining .\nindustrial designer: I think structure is probably what you're saying that , each individual is structured to one particular task , and one parti rather than controlling .\nmarketing: Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nproject manager: Okay .\nindustrial designer: I don't think there's a sense of control 'cause all the decisions have been made in terms of a , like a consensus right , we go around and we think about it ,\nmarketing: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nindustrial designer: but that you know process actually says you have to do it in a certain way .\nproject manager: Uh-huh .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nindustrial designer: It doesn't tell you , you know , some ways that you might wanna be a bit more creative in terms of the process you know , not the {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Okay .\nmarketing: Mm . Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . Yeah .\nproject manager: Okay , uh what about teamwork ?\nmarketing: Um did , you wanna comment Craig ?\nuser interface: Uh , reckon that was a bit hard because we could only discuss things in the meeting .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nuser interface: If we could just go up to somebody outside the meeting and have a quick talk with them , that would've been a lot easier .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: Okay .\nindustrial designer: I think you tried to use the common share folder to to to to communicate ,\nmarketing: Fully agree .\nindustrial designer: but um it just comes back to us so slow in the email\nproject manager: Mm .\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nindustrial designer: um it it doesn't have a , you know , a messenger will go {vocalsound} .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Did uh did you guys get the email I sent you ?\nmarketing: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nproject manager: Oh that's alright .\nuser interface: Not just yet .\nproject manager: I was wondering if that got there okay .\nmarketing: Yeah , got the email .\nindustrial designer: Okay .\nproject manager: Okay , um so um to s to to summarize the teamwork issue , saying that if we could communicate outside the meeting , you know just like quick questions , quick thoughts , whatever , it probably would be bit easier .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: I think the tools that they were given , the tool set that were given to us are fancy but they don't support collaboration , I think that's the word .\nmarketing: Yeah , in it {disfmarker} Mm-hmm ,\nindustrial designer: They don't support the team working together , you know ,\nmarketing: mm-hmm , mm-hmm ,\nproject manager: Oh right , okay .\nmarketing: exactly . Yeah , I mean if you {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: they're still very individual tools .\nmarketing: Yeah , I mean sort of taking upon that idea , w the way I see this i is that it's uh the the s the structure in which we've we've approached this whole task is quite contrary to the p principle of teamwork because the the tasks were d d sort of um divided , and then the work went on in isolation\nproject manager: Mm .\nmarketing: I I don't know what you guys did while you were together , maybe that was a bit different ,\nindustrial designer: We had Play-Doh fun {vocalsound} .\nmarketing: but um yeah , but um but actually if you if you imagine not entire the completely same task given to us but us said okay , first thing we have to do is come up with um let's say um a design concept , and we sit here together and do it ,\nproject manager: Yeah .\nmarketing: well that's what teamwork is . To s to say okay go off and don't talk to each other , it's actually p sort of predisposes you to quite the contrary of teamwork .\nproject manager: Yeah . Okay .\nmarketing: Um not that we haven't done I think the best we could have done .\nproject manager: Okay .\nmarketing: I'm not dissatisfied with it .\nproject manager: Right , uh anything else to say on teamwork at all ?\nindustrial designer: No , not really .\nproject manager: Okay , um what about the you know how we used the whiteboard , the digital pens , the projector , stuff like that ? Um did anybody think anything was like really useful ,\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: anything was pretty un f {vocalsound} unsupportive ?\nmarketing: I think the whiteboard , for me , is the kind of thing I would use all the time , but it's um not quite as useful as to us as it could have been , maybe just in the way that we we use it , in the sense that once we have an idea out there or while work was going on in between meetings , that could have been up on a board uh you know as opposed to in like in text .\nproject manager: Mm .\nmarketing: Um , and then we could then keep our ideas sort of building on that . I know that people who design cars and you know in aviation they quite often just have a simple like fibreglass prototype and it's completely you know um abs abstract from the final product , but they use it as a kind of a context to sort of walk around and puzzle and and point and discuss\nproject manager: Mm-hmm . Yeah . And point at ? Yeah .\nmarketing: and and and in a way everybody's {disfmarker} as we discuss things in the {disfmarker} in theoretically and out of our notebooks , we're just {disfmarker} we're actually just each of us discussing something that's in each of our own minds . It wasn't until we had this here , you know ,\nproject manager: Yeah .\nmarketing: like at one point I peeked across and looked at Craig's paper and I'm like , now I know what he's thinking 'cause I saw his book .\nproject manager: Ah .\nmarketing: But the b the b whiteboard could've actually been this kind of continuing um {disfmarker}\nproject manager: So do you think producing a prototype earlier in the process woulda been a good idea ?\nmarketing: Think could be , yeah .\nindustrial designer: I think um the the focus of it a lot was the PowerPoint as opposed to the to the whiteboard ,\nproject manager: Yeah .\nmarketing: Yeah , yeah .\nindustrial designer: and I think that m um is also does you know hinder us and things I think .\nmarketing: Yeah . Yeah , yeah .\nindustrial designer: It will be cooler to have the whiteboard rather than the the PowerPoint ,\nmarketing: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nindustrial designer: or maybe the whiteboard and the PowerPoint in the same place ,\nmarketing: Yeah . Yeah , yeah .\nindustrial designer: you know in the centre of the {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Okay .\nmarketing: Yeah , because the PowerPoint was provided to us while we had time to prepare , whereas I can imagine if I'd been encouraged to use Paintbrush , for example , or whatever , I would've actually used it ,\nproject manager: Alright .\nmarketing: um 'ca you know , just 'cause that's sorta how we {disfmarker} what we were set up to to use while we had our time .\nproject manager: Okay uh {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: I think that there were too many PowerPoints in the meetings {vocalsound} . 'Cause the plug-in and the plugging spent {disfmarker} we spent a lot of time doing that .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: And a lot of the information on the PowerPoints , I don't think , you know , we needed to actually {disfmarker} it could have , we could have gone through it {gap} verbally ,\nproject manager: Yeah .\nmarketing: No , not quite .\nindustrial designer: especially my slides ,\nmarketing: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: I felt that they just you know {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: Okay .\nindustrial designer: as opposed to having to present them .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: What about the digital pens , did you find them easy enough to use ?\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} Yep clunky .\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Sure , yeah .\nuser interface: Oh they're a bit clunky .\nindustrial designer: Agreed . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah .\nmarketing: Yeah . {vocalsound} Yep .\nproject manager: Clunky , okay .\nmarketing: Mm .\nproject manager: Um {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: Having to tick it before you go off was a bit hindering as well , 'cause you're half way through a thought , and then you run out of paper and then you have to jump .\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nmarketing: Mm .\nproject manager: I know , I think at the very start of today I like wrote a whole load of stuff , didn't click note on one ,\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nproject manager: then went back and wrote one tiny wee thing on the another page , but then did click note , and so I'm quite worried that I've just written over the top of it or something ,\nmarketing: Hmm . Hmm . Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nproject manager: but they'll have my paper anyway um and haven't done that since .\nmarketing: Hmm .\nindustrial designer: But I think the pen is v is very intuitive , everybody knows how to use it , we don't {gap} have to worry .\nproject manager: Yeah ,\nmarketing: Mm-hmm ,\nindustrial designer: So I think the pen's good .\nproject manager: yeah .\nmarketing: mm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nindustrial designer: It's about the best thing . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: And o on the topic of the technology , it just occurred to me that we actually didn't need to move our computers because each computer has all of the files .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nmarketing: It just occurred to me that they all {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: Yeah we only needed one computer and {disfmarker}\nmarketing: We only actually needed one computer .\nproject manager: Yeah , that's true .\nmarketing: If there had been a fifth , that coulda just been sitting there ready to go the whole time .\nuser interface: Good point .\nindustrial designer: And the computer may not um be conducive to a meeting because um you tend to look at your computer and wanna have the urge to check something , you know ,\nmarketing: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .\nindustrial designer: it's useful but {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Yeah .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Do you think the computers just provide distraction in a meeting ?\nindustrial designer: I think too many computers are just distracting .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Um {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Okay . I know I I like to have things written down in front of me actually , like a lot of the stuff that was emailed to me I ended up you know like writing down there or something so I could look at it really quickly and not have the distraction of all of that ,\nmarketing: Mm-hmm . Yep . Mm-hmm .\nindustrial designer: Yep .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: um I don't know about anybody else .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: Um {vocalsound} what else uh any wh I do I'm not really sure what they're looking for when they say new ideas found . Um I don't know is {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Is this for the project or {disfmarker}\nproject manager: could you think of like anything else that would have been helpful today at all ?\nmarketing: Well , the w main one for me is that uh the process na in a natural f context would not have been interrupted by this necessity to discommunicate ourselves from each other .\nproject manager: Mm . Yeah if we just had uh {disfmarker}\nmarketing: So , that's kind of a new idea for me is like just sort of that idea , well you know it's kind of s hard to keep f working forward on a team a team based project when when you're told you must now work away from your team .\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} Yeah I I dunno I think it was quite good that we had time limits on the meetings because they really could have run on and like my experience with meetings is that they really do , and you can spend a lot of time talking about {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Oh yeah . Yeah , yeah .\nproject manager: The only thing is though like when we had our meeting about the conceptual design , I thought there {disfmarker} maybe another fifteen minutes would have been useful there but um {vocalsound} yeah .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm , mm-hmm .\nproject manager: I really thi i I think maybe if we'd like all been working in the one room , and they just said you know like every hour or something everybody make sure yo you know just have a have a short meeting and then just c\nmarketing: Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: just to have like something written down , just like you know a a milestone if you like um rather than having meetings , but {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: There you go . Um so in closing ,\nmarketing: Hmm .\nproject manager: I haven't got my five minutes to go . Thin Oh there it i Five minutes to go . {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Wonderful . Okay um are the costs within the budget , yes they are . And is the project evaluated , yes it is . So now celebrate {vocalsound} .\nmarketing: Great .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: And we have Ninja Homer .\nmarketing: So it {disfmarker} So now we {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Oh yeah .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Well apparently now I write the final report . What are you guys doing now ?\nuser interface: Do we know what the other ones are ?\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: I I don't know .\nproject manager: You dunno ?\nuser interface: Oh wow . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Hmm .\nproject manager: That is lovely . {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Hey yeah , I said Ninja Homer . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: What did you call it ?\nindustrial designer: Ninja Homer . See it looks like Homer Simpson\nmarketing: Huh , huh .\nindustrial designer: but it's electronic so it's made in Japan .\nproject manager: So is that j is that just is that just a logo or does it do anything ?\nmarketing: Logo .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah it's just a logo .\nproject manager: Just a logo and then like Ninja Homer ,\nmarketing: Huh .\nindustrial designer: Ninja Homer . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: right okay . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Mm .\nindustrial designer: The the red is supposed to represent the whatever else you wanna print on the side of it .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: I think it's quite nice .\nmarketing: Fashion technology or something .\nindustrial designer: You can wear Homer ,\nproject manager: {gap}\nindustrial designer: you can throw Homer when you're frustrated , doh . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Hmm , hmm , hmm .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Oh no , that's cool , it's got {disfmarker} I'm kind of {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: It's clunky .\nmarketing: Hmm .\nproject manager: I'm slightly gutted that we couldn't get plastic and rubber , I think that would have been nice .\nmarketing: Yeah , yeah .\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Ah well , maybe from now on real reaction should give us more money .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nindustrial designer: Oh , I did learn something new , Play-Doh is useful .\nmarketing: Hmm .\nindustrial designer: No it is it is .\nproject manager: Play-Doh s\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: It is useful and in in in in in in in um conceptualizing , in being creative .\nmarketing: Huh . Huh .\nindustrial designer: 'Cause like you say , it's something you can put your hands on and feel and touch and get a sense for .\nproject manager: Really ?\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Like we were playing with the Play-Doh and the ideas came with the Play-Doh rather than with everything else .\nproject manager: Did they ?\nindustrial designer: You might wanna write that down . It's just , I'm just fiddling with the Play-Doh , and I'm going yeah yeah it's kinda cool .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: Okay . Play-Doh .\nmarketing: No , it's true , yeah .\nuser interface: Guess I'd forgot how good s Play-Doh smells .\nproject manager: Yeah , it smells funny doesn't it . Um {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Hmm . And some Play-Dohs are actually I think edible aren't they ?\nindustrial designer: No , all Play-Doh is edible .\nproject manager: Yeah like the stuff for {gap} {disfmarker}\nuser interface: I think they're all non-toxic 'cause it's aimed for like two-year-olds .\nproject manager: I think it has to be , yeah .\nindustrial designer: It's just wheat , it's the stuff that your mom could make with preservatives and uh {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Yeah um so to\nmarketing: Wow , hmm .\nproject manager: wha what are your summarising words about Play-Doh ?\nindustrial designer: It's helpful to the creative process .\nmarketing: Huh .\nindustrial designer: Um it engages all your senses not just your sight , but your sense of feel your sense of touch .\nproject manager: Okay .\nmarketing: Yep .\nindustrial designer: And it helps you to understand\nmarketing: Taste . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} dimension as well . I think that that's very helpful because it it starts to pop up ,\nproject manager: Yeah .\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nindustrial designer: whereas on a piece of paper , on a computer , on a board , um even with a three D_ graphic thing it still , it requires a lot of\nproject manager: Yeah .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm , yep . Yeah .\nuser interface: Yeah\nmarketing: Yeah .\nuser interface: it's not very tangible .\nindustrial designer: yeah {disfmarker} tangible , that's a nice word .\nproject manager: Mm-hmm .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm ,\nindustrial designer: It becomes tangible .\nmarketing: mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: Tangible . Okay uh {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Mm . I don't know if there's anything else we needed to discuss .\nindustrial designer: Nope .\nproject manager: That that's about it really . Just sit still I guess for a little while .\nmarketing: Do we retreat to our , to continue our\nindustrial designer: I think we could probably do it here as long as we don't collaborate .\nproject manager: Um {disfmarker}\nmarketing: r reporting or what i\nproject manager: Well I dunno . Um I'm sure the little uh the little thing'll pop up any minute now .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Can we turn off the microphones ?\nproject manager: Yeah , yeah if the meeting's over then yeah I guess so .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}"}]}
