Yeah .\ngrad f: So . I don't expect anyone to . But .\nprofessor b: Um . {vocalsound} So , w what follows ? At some point y you go around and get people to sign something ?\ngrad f: No . We had spoken w about this before\nprofessor b: Yeah , but I 've forgotten .\ngrad f: and we had decided that they have {disfmarker} they only needed to sign once . And the agreement that they already signed simply said that we would give them an opportunity . So as long as we do that , we 're covered .\nprofessor b: And how long of an opportunity did you tell them ?\ngrad f: Uh , July fifteenth .\nprofessor b: July fifteenth . Oh , so they have a plenty of time , and y\ngrad f: Yep .\nprofessor b: Given that it 's that long , um , um {disfmarker} Why was that date chosen ? You just felt you wanted to {disfmarker} ?\ngrad f: Jane told me July fifteenth . So , that 's what I set it .\npostdoc a: Oh . I just meant that that was {pause} the release date that you had on the {pause} data .\nprofessor b: Oh , OK .\ngrad f: Oh . I {disfmarker} I didn't understand that there was something specific .\npostdoc a: I , uh {disfmarker} I thought {disfmarker}\ngrad f: You {disfmarker} y you had {disfmarker}\nprofessor b: I don't {disfmarker}\ngrad f: I had heard July fifteenth , so that 's what I put .\npostdoc a: Mm - hmm .\nprofessor b: No , the only {disfmarker} th the only {pause} mention I recall about that was just that July fifteenth or so is when {vocalsound} this meeting starts .\ngrad f: So .\npostdoc a: That 's right . That 's why .\nprofessor b: Oh , I see .\npostdoc a: You said you wanted it to be available then .\nprofessor b: OK .\npostdoc a: I didn't mean it to be the hard deadline .\nprofessor b: Right .\npostdoc a: It 's fine with me if it is , or we cou But I thought it might be good to remind people two weeks prior to that\nprofessor b: w\npostdoc a: in case , uh {disfmarker} you know , \" by the way {pause} this is your last {disfmarker} \"\nprofessor b: Right .\npostdoc a: Uh . Yeah .\nprofessor b: We probably should have talked about it , cuz i because if we wanna be able to give it to people July fifteenth , if somebody 's gonna come back and say \" OK , I don't want this and this and this used \" , uh , clearly we need some time to respond to that . Right ?\ngrad f: Yeah . As I said , we {disfmarker} I just got one date\nprofessor b: Yeah .\nphd h: Damn !\ngrad f: and that 's the one I used .\nprofessor b: Yeah .\ngrad f: So . But I can send a follow - up . I mean , it 's almost all us . I mean the people who are in the meeti this meeting was , uh , these {disfmarker} the meetings that {disfmarker} in {disfmarker} are in set one .\nphd c: Was my {disfmarker} was my response OK ?\npostdoc a: That 's right .\nphd c: I just wrote you {disfmarker} replied to the email saying they 're all fine .\ngrad f: Right . I mean , that 's fine .\nphd c: OK , good .\ngrad f: I {disfmarker} we don't {disfmarker} My understanding of what we {pause} had agreed upon when we had spoken about this months ago was that , uh , we don't actually need a reply .\nphd c: That makes it easy .\ngrad f: We just need to tell them that they can do it if they want .\nprofessor b: OK . I just didn't remember , but {disfmarker}\ngrad f: And so no reply is no changes .\npostdoc a: And he 's got it so that the default thing you see when you look at the page is \" OK \" .\nprofessor b: OK .\npostdoc a: So that 's very clear all the way down the page , \" OK \" . And they have two options they can change it to . One of them is {pause} \" censor \" , and the other one is \" incorrect \" . Is it {disfmarker} is {disfmarker} your word is \" incorrect \" ?\ngrad f: Right .\npostdoc a: Which means also we get feedback on {pause} if {pause} um , there 's something that they w that needs to be {pause} adjusted , because , I mean , these are very highly technical things . I mean , it 's an added , uh , level of checking on the accuracy of the transcription , as I see it . But in any case , people can agree to things that are wrong .\ngrad f: Well {disfmarker}\npostdoc a: So .\ngrad f: Yeah . The reason I did that it was just so that people would not censor {disfmarker} not ask to have stuff removed because it was transcribed incorrectly ,\npostdoc a: And the reason I liked it was because {disfmarker}\ngrad f: as opposed to , uh {disfmarker}\npostdoc a: was because it , um {disfmarker} it gives them the option of , uh , being able to correct it .\ngrad f: Right .\npostdoc a: Approve it and correct it . And {pause} um . So , you have {pause} it nicely set up so they email you and , uh {disfmarker}\ngrad f: When they submit the form , it gets processed and emailed to me .\npostdoc a: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm . And I wanted to say the meetings that are involved in that set are Robustness and Meeting Recorder .\ngrad f: So .\npostdoc a: The German ones will be ready for next week . Those are three {disfmarker} three of those . A different set of people . And we can impose {disfmarker}\nphd c: The German ones ?\npostdoc a: Uh , well .\nphd h: Yeah . Those {disfmarker} uh {disfmarker}\nprofessor b: NSA .\npostdoc a: OK . I spoke loosely . The {disfmarker} the German , French {disfmarker} Sorry , the German , {vocalsound} Dutch , and Spanish ones .\nphd e: Spanish . Yeah .\ngrad f: Mm - hmm .\nphd c: Oh , those are the NSA meetings ?\nphd e: The non - native {disfmarker}\nphd h: Those are {disfmarker}\npostdoc a: Yeah . Uh - huh .\nprofessor b: German , Dutch , Swiss and Spanish .\nphd c: Oh , oh ! OK .\nphd e: The all non - native {disfmarker}\npostdoc a: That 's {disfmarker} that 's {disfmarker} that 's r\ngrad f: Mm - hmm .\nphd h: Uh - huh .\nphd c: OK . I 'd {disfmarker} I d\npostdoc a: Yeah . {pause} It 's the other group .\nprofessor b: I It was the network {disfmarker} network services group .\nphd c: OK .\npostdoc a: Uh - huh . Yeah , exactly . Yeah .\nprofessor b: Yeah .\npostdoc a: I didn't mean to {pause} isolate them .\nprofessor b: Otherwise known as the German , Dutch , and Spanish .\npostdoc a: Yeah . Sorry . It was {disfmarker} it was not the best characterization .\ngrad f: Mm - hmm .\npostdoc a: But what {disfmarker} {vocalsound} what I meant to say was that it 's the other group that 's not {disfmarker} n no m no overlap with our present members . And then maybe it 'd be good to set an explicit deadline , something like {pause} a week {pause} before that , uh , J July fifteenth date , or two weeks before .\nprofessor b: I mean , I would suggest we discuss {disfmarker} I mean , if we 're going to have a policy on it , that we discuss the length of time that we want to give people ,\ngrad f: Mm - hmm .\nprofessor b: so that we have a uniform thing . So , tha that 's a month , which is fine . I mean , it seems {disfmarker}\nphd c: Twelve hours .\ngrad f: Well , the only thing I said in the email is that {pause} the data is going to be released on the fifteenth . I didn't give any other deadline .\npostdoc a: Mm - hmm .\ngrad f: So my feeling is if someone after the fifteenth says , \" wow I suddenly found something \" , we 'll delete it from our record . We just won't delete it from whatever 's already been released .\npostdoc a: Hmm . That 's a little bit difficult .\ngrad f: What else can we do ?\npostdoc a: Yeah .\ngrad f: If someone says \" hey , look , I {pause} found something in this meeting and {pause} it 's libelous and I want it removed \" . What can we do ?\npostdoc a: Well . {pause} That 's true .\ngrad f: We have to remove it .\npostdoc a: I {disfmarker} I agree with that part , but I think that it would {disfmarker} it , uh {disfmarker} we need to have , uh , a {disfmarker} a {disfmarker} a message to them very clearly that {vocalsound} beyond this date , you can't make additional changes .\nprofessor b: I mean , um , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} {vocalsound} i I think that somebody might {pause} request something even though we say that . But I think it 's good to at least start some place like that .\npostdoc a: Mm - hmm . Good .\nprofessor b: So if we agreed , {vocalsound} OK , how long is a reasonable amount of time for people to have {disfmarker} if we say two weeks , or if we say a month , I think we should just say that {disfmarker} say that , you know , i a as {pause} um , {vocalsound} \" per the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the , uh , page you signed , you have the ability to look over this stuff \" and so forth \" and , uh , because we w \" these , uh {disfmarker} I would {disfmarker} I would imagine some sort of generic thing that would say \" because we , uh , will continually be making these things available {vocalsound} to other researchers , uh , this can't be open - ended and so , uh , uh , please give us back your response within this am you know , within this amount of time \" , whatever time we agree upon .\ngrad f: Well , did you read the email and look at the pages I sent ?\nprofessor b: Did I ? No , I haven't yet . No , just {disfmarker}\ngrad f: No . OK , well why don't you do that and then make comments on what you want me to change ?\nprofessor b: No , no . I 'm not saying that you should change anything . I I 'm {disfmarker} what I 'm {disfmarker} what I 'm {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I 'm trying to spark a discussion hopefully among people who have read it so that {disfmarker} that you can {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you can , uh , decide on something .\npostdoc a: Mm - hmm .\nprofessor b: So I 'm not telling you what to decide .\npostdoc a: Mm - hmm .\nprofessor b: I 'm just saying you should decide something ,\npostdoc a: OK .\nprofessor b: and then {disfmarker}\ngrad f: I already did decide something , and that 's what 's in the email .\npostdoc a: Yeah , yeah . OK , so {disfmarker}\ngrad f: And if you disagree with it , why don't you read it and give me comments on it ?\npostdoc a: Yeah . Well {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think that there 's one missing line .\nprofessor b: Well , the one thing that I did read and that you just repeated to me {pause} was that you gave the specific date of July fifteenth .\ngrad f: Mm - hmm .\nprofessor b: And you also just said that the reason you said that was because someone said it to you . So what I 'm telling you {pause} is that what you should do is come up with a length of time that you guys think is enough\ngrad f: Right .\nprofessor b: and you should use that rather than {pause} this date that you just got from somewhere . That 's all I 'm saying .\ngrad f: OK .\nprofessor b: OK ?\npostdoc a: I ha I have one question . This is in the summer period and presumably people may be out of town . But we can make the assumption , can't we ? that , um , they will be receiving email , uh , most of the month . Right ? Because if someone {disfmarker}\nprofessor b: It {disfmarker} well , it {disfmarker} well , you 're right . Sometimes somebody will be {pause} away and , uh , you know , there 's , uh {disfmarker} for any length of time that you {vocalsound} uh , choose {pause} there is some person sometime who will not {pause} end up reading it .\npostdoc a: OK .\nprofessor b: That 's {disfmarker} it 's , you know , just a certain risk to take .\nphd h: S so maybe when {disfmarker} Am I on , by the way ?\ngrad f: I don't know . You should be .\nphd h: Oh . Hello ? Hello ?\ngrad f: You should be channel B .\nphd h: Oh , OK . Alright . So . The , um {disfmarker} Maybe we should say in {disfmarker} w you know , when the whole thing starts , when they sign the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the agreement {vocalsound} that {disfmarker} you know , specify exactly uh , what , you know , how {disfmarker} how they will be contacted and they can , you know {disfmarker} they can be asked to give a phone number and an email address , or both . And , um , then {disfmarker}\npostdoc a: We did that , I {disfmarker} I believe .\nphd h: Right .\nphd e: Yeah .\nphd h: So . {vocalsound} A And , then , you know , say very clearly that if they don't {disfmarker} if we don't hear from them , you know , as Morgan suggested , by a certain time or after a certain {vocalsound} period after we contact them {vocalsound} that is implicitly giving their agreement .\ngrad f: Well , they 've already signed a form .\npostdoc a: And the form says {disfmarker}\nphd e: And nobody {disfmarker} nobody really reads it anyway .\nphd h: Right .\ngrad f: So . And the s and the form was approved by Human Subjects ,\nphd h: Says that . Right .\npostdoc a: Uh , the f\nphd h: Well , if that 's i tha if that 's already {disfmarker} if {disfmarker}\ngrad f: so , eh , that 's gonna be a little hard to modify .\npostdoc a: Well , the form {disfmarker} Well , the form doesn't say , if {disfmarker} uh , you know , \" if you don't respond by X number of days or X number of weeks {disfmarker} \"\nphd h: I see . Uh {disfmarker} Oh , OK . So what does it say about the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the process of {disfmarker} of , uh {disfmarker} {vocalsound} y the review process ?\npostdoc a: It doesn't have a time limit . That you 'll be provided access to the transcripts and then , uh , allowed to {pause} remove things that you 'd like to remove , before it goes to the general {disfmarker} uh , larger audience .\nphd h: Oh , OK . Hmm . Right .\ngrad f: Here .\npostdoc a: There you go .\ngrad f: You can read what you already signed .\nphd h: Oh .\nphd e: I guess when I {pause} read it , um {disfmarker}\nphd h: OK .\nphd e: I 'm not as diligent as Chuck , but I had the feeling I should probably respond and tell Adam , like , \" I got this and I will do it by this date , and if you don't hear from me by then {disfmarker} \" You know , in other words responding to your email {pause} once , right away , saying \" as soon as you get this could you please respond . \"\ngrad f: Right .\nphd e: And then if you {disfmarker} if the person thinks they 'll need more time because they 're out of town or whatever , they can tell you at that point ? Because {disfmarker}\ngrad f: Oh , I just {disfmarker} I didn't wanna do that , because I don't wanna have a discussion with every person {pause} if I can avoid it .\nphd e: Well , it 's {disfmarker}\ngrad f: So what I wanted to do was just send it out and say \" on the fifteenth , the data is released ,\npostdoc a: Mm - hmm .\ngrad f: if you wanna do something about it , do something about it , but that 's it \" .\npostdoc a: I {disfmarker} I kind of like this .\nphd e: Well {disfmarker}\npostdoc a: Yeah .\nphd e: OK . So , we 're assuming that {disfmarker}\nphd h: Well , that 's {disfmarker} that would be great if {disfmarker} but you should probably have a {pause} legal person look at this and {pause} make sure it 's OK . Because if you {disfmarker} if you , uh , do this {vocalsound} and you {disfmarker} then there 's a dispute later and , uh , some {disfmarker} {vocalsound} you know , someone who understands these matters concludes that they didn't have , uh , you know , enough opportunity to actually {vocalsound} exercise their {disfmarker} their right {disfmarker}\nphd e: Or they {disfmarker} they might never have gotten the email , because although they signed this , they don't know by which date to expect your email . And so {pause} someone whose machine is down or whatever {disfmarker} I mean , we have no {disfmarker}\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm .\nphd e: in internally we know that people are there ,\ngrad f: Well , OK . l Let me {disfmarker} Let me reverse this .\nphd e: but we have no confirmation that they got the mail .\ngrad f: So let 's say someone {disfmarker} I send this out , and someone doesn't respond . Do we delete every meeting that they were in ?\nphd e: Well , then {disfmarker}\ngrad f: I don't think so .\nphd e: It {disfmarker} we 're hoping that doesn't happen ,\nphd h: No .\nphd e: but that 's why there 's such a thing as registered mail\ngrad f: That will happen .\nphd e: or {disfmarker}\nphd h: That will happen .\nphd e: Right .\ngrad f: That will absolutely happen . Because people don't read their email , or they 'll read and say \" I don't care about that , I 'm not gonna delete anything \" and they don just won't reply to it .\nphd h: Maybe {disfmarker} uh , do we have mailing addresses for these people ?\ngrad f: No . We have what they put on the speaker form ,\nphd h: No .\npostdoc a: Well {disfmarker} {comment} {vocalsound} Most {disfmarker}\ngrad f: which was just generic contact information .\nphd h: Oh .\npostdoc a: But the ones that we 're dealing with now are all local ,\nphd h: Well , then {disfmarker}\npostdoc a: except the ones who {disfmarker} I mean , we {disfmarker} we 're totally in contact with all the ones in those two groups .\nphd h: Mmm . OK .\npostdoc a: So maybe , uh , I {disfmarker} you know , that 's not that many people and if I {disfmarker} if , uh {disfmarker} i i there is an advantage to having them admit {disfmarker} and if I can help with {disfmarker} with processing that , I will . It 's {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} there is an advantage to having them be on record as having received the mail and indicating {disfmarker}\ngrad f: Yeah . I mean I thought we had discussed this , like , a year ago .\npostdoc a: Yes , we did .\ngrad f: And so it seems like this is a little odd for it to be coming up yet again .\npostdoc a: You 're right . Well , I {disfmarker} you know . But sometimes {disfmarker}\nprofessor b: Well , we {disfmarker} we haven't experienced it before .\ngrad f: So .\npostdoc a: That 's right .\nprofessor b: Right ? So {disfmarker}\nphd e: You 'll either wonder {pause} at the beginning or you 'll wonder at the end .\npostdoc a: Need to get it right .\nphd e: I mean , there 's no way to get around {disfmarker} I It 's pretty much the same am amount of work except for an additional email just saying they got the email .\npostdoc a: Yeah .\nphd e: And maybe it 's better legally to wonder before {disfmarker} you know , a little bit earlier than {disfmarker}\ngrad f: Well {disfmarker}\npostdoc a: It 's much easier to explain {pause} this way .\ngrad f: OK . Well , why don't you talk {pause} t\npostdoc a: T t to have it on record .\ngrad f: Morgan , can you talk to our lawyer about it , and find out what the status is on this ? Cuz I don't wanna do something that we don't need to .\npostdoc a: Yeah , but w Mmm .\ngrad f: Because what {disfmarker} I 'm telling you , people won't respond to the email . No matter what you do , you there 're gonna be people who {pause} you 're gonna have to make a lot of effort to get in contact with .\npostdoc a: Well , then we make the effort .\ngrad d: I mean , i it 's k\ngrad f: And do we want to spend that effort ?\nphd h: Hmm .\npostdoc a: We make the effort .\ngrad d: It 's kind of like signing up for a mailing list . They have opt in and opt out . And there are two different ways . I mean , and either way works probably , I mean .\npostdoc a: Except I really think in this case {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I 'm agr I agree with Liz , that we need to be {pause} in the clear and not have to after the fact say \" oh , but I assumed \" , and \" oh , I 'm sorry that your email address was just accumulating mail without notifying you \" , you know .\nprofessor b: If this is a purely administrative task , we can actually have administration do it .\npostdoc a: Oh , excellent .\nprofessor b: But the thing is that , you know , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I think , without going through a whole expensive thing with our lawyers , {vocalsound} from my previous conversations with them , my {disfmarker} my sense very {pause} much is that we would want something on record {pause} as indicating that they actually were aware of this .\npostdoc a: Yes .\ngrad f: Well , we had talked about this before\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm .\ngrad f: and I thought that we had even gone by the lawyers asking about that and they said you have to s they 've already signed away the f with that form {disfmarker} that they 've already signed once .\npostdoc a: I don't remember that this issue of {pause} the time period allowed for response was ever covered .\ngrad f: Yeah .\nprofessor b: Yeah . We never really talked about that .\ngrad f: OK .\nphd e: Or the date at which they would be receiving the email from you .\npostdoc a: Or {disfmarker} or how they would indicate {disfmarker}\nprofessor b: Yeah .\nphd e: They probably forgot all about it .\nprofessor b: We certainly didn't talk , uh , about {disfmarker} with them at all about , uh , the manner of them being {disfmarker} {vocalsound} made the , uh , uh , materials available .\nphd e: Yeah .\nphd h: We do it like with these {disfmarker}\nprofessor b: That was something that was sort of just within our implementation .\ngrad f: OK .\nphd h: We can use it {disfmarker} we can use a {disfmarker} a ploy like they use to , um {disfmarker} you know , that when they serve , like {disfmarker} uh , uh , uh {disfmarker} {comment} uh , you know , like dead - beat dads , they {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} they make it look like they won something in the lottery and then they open the envelope\ngrad d: And they 're served .\nphd h: and that {disfmarker} Right ? Because {disfmarker} and then the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the {disfmarker} the thing is served . So you just make it , you know , \" oh , you won {disfmarker} you know , go to this web site and you 've , uh {disfmarker} you 're {disfmarker} \"\nphd e: That 's why you never open these things that come in the mail .\npostdoc a: That one .\nprofessor b: Yeah .\ngrad f: Well , it 's just , we 've gone from one extreme to the other , where at one point , a few months ago , Morgan was {disfmarker} you were saying let 's not do anything ,\nphd h: Right . {vocalsound} Right . No , it I {disfmarker} it might {disfmarker}\npostdoc a: Well , it doesn't matter .\nphd h: i i it {disfmarker} it might well be the case {disfmarker}\ngrad f: and now we 're {disfmarker} we 're saying we have to follow up each person and get a signature ?\nphd h: it might {disfmarker} Right .\ngrad f: I mean , what are we gonna doing here ?\nphd h: It might well be the case that {disfmarker} that this is perfectly {disfmarker} you know , this is enough to give us a basis t to just , eh , assume their consent if they don't reply .\nprofessor b: Well .\ngrad f: Mm - hmm .\nphd h: But , I 'm not {disfmarker} you know , me not being a lawyer , I wouldn't just wanna do that without {pause} having the {disfmarker} the expert , uh , opinion on that .\npostdoc a: And how many people ? Al - altogether we 've got twenty people . These people are people who read their email almost all the time .\ngrad f: Then I think we had better find out , so that we can find a {disfmarker}\nphd h: Yeah .\nprofessor b: Let me look at this again .\ngrad f: Right .\npostdoc a: I {disfmarker} I really don't see that it 's a problem . I {disfmarker} I think that it 's a common courtesy to ask them {disfmarker} uh , to expect for them to , uh , be able to have @ @ {comment} us try to contact them ,\ngrad f: For {disfmarker} for th\npostdoc a: u just in case they hadn't gotten their email . I think they 'd appreciate it .\nprofessor b: Yeah . My {disfmarker} Adam , my {disfmarker} my view before was about {pause} the nature of what was {disfmarker} of the presentation ,\ngrad f: Mm - hmm .\nprofessor b: of {disfmarker} of how {pause} my {disfmarker} my {disfmarker} the things that we 're questioning were along the lines of how easy {disfmarker} uh , h how m how much implication would there be that it 's likely you 're going to be changing something , as opposed to {disfmarker}\ngrad f: Mm - hmm .\nprofessor b: That was the kind of dispute I was making before .\npostdoc a: Mm - hmm . I remember that .\nprofessor b: But , um , the attorneys , I {disfmarker} uh , I can guarantee you , the attorneys will always come back with {disfmarker} and we have to decide how stringent we want to be in these things , but they will always come back with saying {vocalsound} that , um , you need to {disfmarker} you want to have someth some paper trail or {disfmarker} which includes electronic trail {disfmarker} {vocalsound} that they have , uh , in fact {pause} O K 'd it .\ngrad f: Mm - hmm .\nprofessor b: So , um , I think that if you f i if {pause} we send the email as you have and if there 's half the people , say , who don't respond {pause} at all by , you know , some period of time , {vocalsound} we can just make a list of these people and hand it to , uh {disfmarker} you know , just give it to me and I 'll hand it to administrative staff or whatever ,\ngrad f: Right .\nprofessor b: and they 'll just call them up and say , you know , \" have you {disfmarker} Is {disfmarker} is this OK ? And would you please mail {disfmarker} you know , mail Adam that it is , if i if it , you know , is or not . \" So , you know , we can {disfmarker} we can do that .\nphd e: The other thing that there 's a psychological effect that {disfmarker} at least for most people , that if they 've responded to your email saying \" yes , I will do it \" or \" yes , I got your email \" , they 're more likely to actually do it {comment} {pause} later {pause} than to just ignore it .\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm .\nphd e: And of course we don't want them to bleep things out , but it {disfmarker} it 's a little bit better if we 're getting the {disfmarker} their , uh , final response , once they 've answered you once than if they never answer you 'd {comment} at al at all . That 's how these mailing houses work . So , I mean , it 's not completely lost work because it might benefit us in terms of getting {pause} responses .\npostdoc a: Mm - hmm .\nphd e: You know , an official OK from somebody {pause} is better than no answer , even if they responded that they got your email . And they 're probably more likely to do that once they 've responded that they got the email .\npostdoc a: I also think they 'd just simply appreciate it . I think it 's a good {disfmarker} a good way of {disfmarker} of fostering goodwill among our subjects . Well , our participants .\nprofessor b: I think the main thing is {disfmarker} I mean , what lawyers do is they always look at worst cases .\ngrad f: Sending lots of spam .\nprofessor b: So they s so {disfmarker} so {disfmarker} Tha - that 's what they 're paid to do .\ngrad f: Yep .\nprofessor b: And so , {vocalsound} it is certainly possible that , uh , somebody 's server would be down or something and they wouldn't actually hear from us , and then they find this thing is in there and we 've already distributed it to someone . So , {vocalsound} what it says in there , in fact , is that they will be given an opportunity to blah - blah - blah ,\npostdoc a: Mm - hmm .\nprofessor b: but if in fact {disfmarker} if we sent them something or we thought we sent them something but they didn't actually receive it for some reason , {vocalsound} um , then we haven't given them that .\ngrad f: Well , so how far do we have to go ? Do we need to get someone 's signature ? Or , is email enough ?\nprofessor b: I i i em email is enough .\ngrad f: Do we have to have it notarized ? I mean {disfmarker} OK .\nprofessor b: Yeah . I mean , I 've been through this {disfmarker} I mean , I 'm not a lawyer , but I 've been through these things a f things f like this a few times with lawyers now\ngrad f: Mm - hmm .\nprofessor b: so I {disfmarker} I {vocalsound} I I 'm pretty comfortable with that .\nphd c: Do you track , um , when people log in to look at the {disfmarker} ?\ngrad f: Uh . If they submit the form , I get it .\nphd c: Uh - huh .\ngrad f: If they don't submit the form , it goes in the general web log . But that 's not sufficient .\nphd c: Hmm .\ngrad f: Right ? Cuz if someone just visits the web site that doesn't {pause} imply anything in particular .\nphd c: Except that you know they got the mail .\npostdoc a: Mm - hmm . That 's right .\ngrad f: Right .\npostdoc a: I {disfmarker} I could get you on the notify list if you want me to .\ngrad f: I 'm already on it .\npostdoc a: For that directory ? OK , great .\ngrad f: Mm - hmm .\nprofessor b: So again , hopefully , um , this shouldn't be quite as odious a problem either way , uh , in any of the extremes we 've talked about because {vocalsound} uh , we 're talking a pretty small {pause} number of people .\ngrad f: W For this set , I 'm not worried , because {pause} we basically know everyone on it .\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm .\npostdoc a: Hmm .\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm .\ngrad f: You know , they 're all more or less here or it 's {disfmarker} it 's Eric and Dan and so on . But for some of the others , you 're talking about visitors who are {pause} gone from ICSI , whose email addresses may or may not work ,\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm .\npostdoc a: Oh .\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm .\ngrad f: and {disfmarker} So what are we gonna do when we run into someone that we can't get in touch with ?\npostdoc a: I don't think , uh {disfmarker} They 're so recent , these visitors .\ngrad f: Mm - hmm .\npostdoc a: I {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and I {disfmarker} they 're also so {disfmarker}\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm .\npostdoc a: They 're prominent enough that they 're easy to find through {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I mean , I {disfmarker} I w I 'll be able to {disfmarker} if you have any trouble finding them , I really think I could find them .\ngrad f: Other methods ? OK .\nprofessor b: Yeah . Cuz it {disfmarker} what it {disfmarker} what it really does promise here is that we will ask their permission . Um , and I think , you know , if you go into a room and close the door and {disfmarker} and ask their permission {vocalsound} and they 're not there , it doesn't seem {comment} that that 's the intent of , uh , meaning here . So .\ngrad f: Well , the qu the question is just whether {disfmarker} how active it has to be . I mean , because they {disfmarker} they filled out a contact information and that 's where I 'm sending the information .\nprofessor b: Right .\ngrad f: And so far everyone has done email . There isn't anyone who did , uh , any other contact method .\nprofessor b: Well , the way ICSI goes , people , uh , who , uh , were here ten years ago still have acc {vocalsound} have forwards to other accounts and so on .\ngrad f: Yeah .\nprofessor b: So it 's unusual that {disfmarker} that they , uh {disfmarker}\ngrad f: So my original impression was that that was sufficient , that if they give us contact information and that contact information isn't accurate that {pause} we fulfilled our burden .\nprofessor b: Yeah .\nphd e: Then they just come back .\nphd c: All my files were still here .\nphd e: Same as us .\npostdoc a: I just {disfmarker}\nprofessor b: So if we get to a boundary case like that then maybe I will call the attorney about it .\nphd c: Yeah .\ngrad f: OK .\nprofessor b: But , you know , hopefully we won't need to .\npostdoc a: I d I just don't think we will . For all the reasons that we 've discussed .\ngrad f: Alright .\nprofessor b: So we 'll {disfmarker} we 'll see if we do or not .\ngrad f: Yep . And we 'll see how many people respond to that email .\npostdoc a: Yeah .\ngrad f: So far , two people have .\nprofessor b: Yeah . I think very few people will\ngrad f: So .\nprofessor b: and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and , you know , people {disfmarker} people see long emails about things that they don't think {vocalsound} is gonna be high priority , they typically , uh , don't {disfmarker} don't read it , or half read it .\ngrad f: Right .\nprofessor b: Cuz people are swamped .\npostdoc a: And actually ,\nprofessor b: But {disfmarker}\npostdoc a: um , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} didn't anticipate this so I {disfmarker} that 's why I didn't give this comment , and it {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} this discussion has made me think it might be nice to have a follow - up email within the next couple of days saying \" by the way , you know , we wanna hear back from you by X date and please {disfmarker} \" , and then add what Liz said {disfmarker} \" please , uh , respond to {disfmarker} please indicate you received this mail . \"\nprofessor b: Uh , or e well , maybe even additionally , uh , um , \" Even if you 've decided you have no changes you 'd like to make , if you could tell us that \" .\ngrad f: Respond to the email . {comment} Yep .\npostdoc a: Mm - hmm . It is the first time through the cycle .\nprofessor b: Yeah .\nphd e: Right . That would {disfmarker} that would definitely work on me . You know , it makes you feel m like , um , if you were gonna p if you 're predicting that you might not answer , you have a chance now to say that . Whereas , I {disfmarker} I mean , I would be much more likely myself ,\nphd c: And the other th\nphd e: given all my email , t to respond at that point , saying \" you know what , I 'm probably not gonna get to it \" or whatever , rather than just having seen the email , thinking I might get to it , and never really , {vocalsound} uh , pushing myself to actually do it until it 's too late .\nphd c: Yeah . I was {disfmarker} I was thinking that it also {pause} lets them know that they don't have to go to the page to {pause} accept this .\nphd e: Right . R Right . That 's true .\nprofessor b: Right .\nphd c: I mean , I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} Yeah . So that way they could {disfmarker} they can see from that email that if they just write back and say \" I got it , no changes \" , they 're off the hook .\nprofessor b: Yeah .\nphd c: They don't have to go to the web page\nprofessor b: I mean , the other thing I 've learned from dealing with {disfmarker} dealing with people sending in reviews and so forth , uh , is , um , {vocalsound} if you say \" you 've got three months to do this review \" , {vocalsound} um , people do it , you know , {vocalsound} two and seven eighths months from now .\nphd c: and {disfmarker}\nphd e: Yeah . That 's true .\nprofessor b: If you say \" you 've got three weeks to do this review \" , they do {disfmarker} do it , you know , two and seven eighths weeks from now {disfmarker} {vocalsound} they do the review .\ngrad f: Right .\nprofessor b: And , um {disfmarker} So , if we make it {pause} a little less time , I don't think it 'll be that much {disfmarker}\ngrad f: Well , and also if we want it ready by the fifteenth , that means we better give them deadline of the first , if we have any prayer of actually getting everyone to respond in time .\nprofessor b: There 's the responding part and there 's also what if , uh , I mean , I hope this doesn't happen , what if there are a bunch of deletions that have to get put in and changes ?\ngrad f: Right .\nprofessor b: Then {vocalsound} we actually have to deal with that\npostdoc a: Mm - hmm . Some lead time .\nprofessor b: if we want it to {disfmarker}\ngrad f: Ugh ! Disk space ,\npostdoc a: By the way , has {disfmarker} has Jeremy signed the form ?\ngrad f: oh my god ! I hadn't thought about that .\npostdoc a: OK .\ngrad f: That for every meeting {disfmarker} any meeting which has any bleeps in it we need yet another copy of .\nphd h: Oh .\nphd c: Just that channel .\ngrad d: Can't you just do that channel ?\nphd c: Oh , no . We have to do {disfmarker}\ngrad f: No , of course not .\nphd e: Yeah . You have to do all of them ,\ngrad f: You need all the channels .\ngrad d: Oh .\nphd c: Do you have to do the other close - talking ?\nphd e: as well as all of these .\ngrad d: Yeah .\nphd e: You have to do all {disfmarker} You could just do it in that time period , though ,\ngrad f: Yes . Absolutely . There 's a lot of cross - talk .\ngrad g: Wow .\npostdoc a: Well {disfmarker}\nphd e: but I guess it 's a pain .\ngrad f: Well , but you have to copy the whole file .\nphd e: Yeah .\ngrad f: Right ? Because we 're gonna be releasing the whole file .\nphd e: Yeah . You 're right .\npostdoc a: Well {disfmarker} {vocalsound} I {disfmarker} you know , I think at a certain point , that copy that has the deletions will become the master copy .\ngrad f: Yeah . It 's just I hate deleting any data . So I {disfmarker} I don't want {disfmarker} I really would rather make a copy of it , rather than bleep it out\nprofessor b: Are you del are you bleeping it by adding ?\ngrad f: and then {disfmarker} Overlapping . So , it 's {disfmarker} it 's exactly a censor bleep . So what I really think is \" bleep \"\nprofessor b: I I I I understand , but is {disfmarker} is it summing signals\ngrad f: and then I want to {disfmarker}\nprofessor b: or do you {pause} delete the old one and put the new one in ?\ngrad f: I delete the old one , put the new one in .\nprofessor b: Oh , OK . Cuz {disfmarker}\ngrad f: There 's nothing left of the original signal .\nprofessor b: Oh . Cuz if you were summing , you could {disfmarker} No . But anyway {disfmarker}\ngrad f: Yeah . It would be qui quite easy to get it back again .\npostdoc a: But {disfmarker} {vocalsound} And then w I was gonna say also that the they don't have to stay on the system , as you know ,\nprofessor b: Yeah .\nphd e: Then someday we can sell the {pause} unedited versions .\npostdoc a: cuz {disfmarker} cuz the {disfmarker} the ones {disfmarker}\ngrad f: Say again ?\npostdoc a: Once it 's been successfully bleeped , can't you rely on the {disfmarker} ?\nphd c: Or {pause} we 'll tell people the frequency of the beep\nprofessor b: Encrypt it .\nphd c: and then they could subtract the beep out .\ngrad d: You can hide it . Yeah .\npostdoc a: Can't you rely on the archiving to preserve the older version ?\nphd h: Oh , yeah .\ngrad d: It wouldn't be that hard to hide it .\nphd e: Right . Exactly . I see .\ngrad f: Yeah , that 's true . Yeah . Yep , that 's true .\nphd e: See , this is good . I wanted to create some {pause} side conversations in these meetings .\npostdoc a: OK .\nprofessor b: Yeah . You could encrypt it , you know , with a {disfmarker} with a two hundred bit {disfmarker} {vocalsound} thousand bit , uh {disfmarker}\ngrad d: You can use spread spectrum .\nphd c: Uh - huh .\ngrad d: Hide it .\nphd e: So {disfmarker}\nphd c: Here we go .\nphd e: Yeah . Yeah .\ngrad d: Yeah , there you go .\nphd e: Cuz we don't have enough asides .\nphd h: I have an idea . You reverse the signal ,\ngrad d: There you go .\nphd h: so it {disfmarker} it lets people say what they said backwards .\ngrad f: Backwards .\ngrad d: Then you have , like , subliminal , uh , messages ,\ngrad f: But , ha you 've seen the {disfmarker} this {disfmarker} the speech recognition system that reversed very short segments .\nphd h: Yeah .\ngrad d: like .\ngrad f: Did you read that paper ? It wouldn't work .\nphd h: No .\ngrad f: The speech recognizer still works .\nphd e: Yeah . And if you do it backward then {disfmarker}\nprofessor b: Yeah .\nphd c: That 's cuz they use forward - backward .\nphd e: H - good old HMM .\ngrad f: Forward but backward . That 's right .\nphd e: No , it 's backward - forward .\ngrad f: Good point . A point . Well , I 'm sorry if I sound a little peeved about this whole thing . It 's just we 've had meeting after meeting after meeting a on this and it seems like we 've never gotten it resolved .\npostdoc a: Hmm .\nprofessor b: Well , but we never also {disfmarker} we 've also never done it .\nphd e: Uh .\ngrad f: So .\npostdoc a: This is the first cycle .\nphd e: If it makes {disfmarker}\ngrad f: Yeah .\npostdoc a: There 're bound to be some glitches the first time through .\nprofessor b: So . {vocalsound} And , uh {disfmarker} and I 'm sorry responding without , uh , having much knowledge , but the thing is , uh , I am , like , one of these people who gets a gazillion mails and {disfmarker} and stuff comes in as\ngrad f: Well , and that 's exactly why I did it the way I did it , which is the default is if you do nothing we 're gonna release it .\nprofessor b: Yeah .\ngrad f: Because , you know , I have my {pause} stack of emails of to d to be done , that , you know , fifty or sixty long , and the ones at the top I 'm never gonna get to .\nprofessor b: Right .\ngrad f: And , uh {pause} So {disfmarker} so {disfmarker}\nphd c: Move them to the bottom .\nprofessor b: So {disfmarker} so the only thing we 're missing is {disfmarker} is some way to respond to easily to say , uh , \" OK , go ahead \" or something .\ngrad f: Yeah , right . So , i this is gonna mean {disfmarker}\nphd c: Just re - mail them to yourself and then they 're at the bottom .\nprofessor b: Yeah .\ngrad f: Yeah .\npostdoc a: Yeah .\ngrad f: Yeah . That 's actually definitely a good point . The m email doesn't specify that you can just reply to the email , as op as opposed to going to the form\npostdoc a: Mm - hmm .\nphd h: In {disfmarker}\npostdoc a: And it also doesn't give a {disfmarker} a specific {disfmarker} I didn't think of it .\nphd e: Right .\ngrad f: and {disfmarker}\npostdoc a: S I think it 's a good idea {disfmarker} an ex explicit time by which this will be considered definite .\ngrad f: Yeah , release .\npostdoc a: And {disfmarker} and it has to be a time earlier than that endpoint .\nprofessor b: Yeah . It 's converging .\npostdoc a: Yeah . That 's right .\nphd h: This {disfmarker} um , I 've seen this recently . Uh , I got email , and it {disfmarker} i if I use a MIME - capable mail reader , it actually says , you know , click on this button to confirm receipt {pause} of the {disfmarker} of the mail .\npostdoc a: Oh , that 's interesting .\ngrad d: Hmm .\nphd h: So {disfmarker}\ngrad f: You {disfmarker} you can {disfmarker}\ngrad d: It 's like certified mail .\ngrad f: A lot of mailers support return receipt .\npostdoc a: Could do that .\nphd h: Right .\ngrad f: But it doesn't confirm that they 've read it .\nphd h: No , no , no . This is different . This is not {disfmarker} So , I {disfmarker} I know , you can tell , you know , the , uh , mail delivery agent to {disfmarker} to confirm that the mail was delivered to your mailbox .\npostdoc a: Mmm .\ngrad f: Right .\nphd h: But {disfmarker} but , no . This was different . Ins - in the mail , there was a {disfmarker}\ngrad f: Oh , just a button .\nphd h: uh , th there was a button that when you clicked on it , it would send , uh , you know , a actual acknowledgement to the sender that you had actually looked at the mail .\ngrad f: Oh , yeah . Yeah . Unfor - Yeah , we could do that . But I hate that .\nphd h: But it o but it only works for , you know , MIME - capable {disfmarker} you know , if you use Netscape or something like that for your n\ngrad f: Yeah .\nprofessor b: And {disfmarker}\nphd e: You might as well just respond to the mail .\nprofessor b: And we actually need a third thing .\nphd e: I mean\nphd h: Right .\nprofessor b: It 's not that you 've looked at it , it 's that you 've looked at it and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and agree with one of the possible actions .\nphd h: No , no . You can do that .\nprofessor b: Right ?\nphd h: You know , you can put this button anywhere you want ,\nprofessor b: Oh ? Oh , I see .\nphd h: and you can put it the bottom of the message and say \" here , by {disfmarker} you know , by clicking on this , I {disfmarker} I agree {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh , you know , I acknowledge {disfmarker} \"\nprofessor b: That i i my first - born children are yours , and {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah .\nphd e: Quick question . Are , um {disfmarker}\ngrad f: Well , I could put a URL in there without any difficulty and {pause} even pretty simple MIME readers can do that . So .\npostdoc a: But why shouldn't they just {pause} email back ? I don't see there 's a problem .\nprofessor b: Yeah .\ngrad f: Yeah . Reply .\nphd h: Right .\npostdoc a: It 's very nice . I {disfmarker} I like the high - tech aspect of it ,\nprofessor b: Yeah .\npostdoc a: but I think {disfmarker}\nphd h: No , no , no . {vocalsound} I actually don't .\npostdoc a: I appreciate it .\nphd h: I 'm just saying that\ngrad f: Well , I {disfmarker} cuz I use a text mail reader .\nphd h: if ev but I 'm {disfmarker}\nphd e: Don't you use VI for your mai ?\nphd h: Yeah .\nprofessor b: Wow . That 's {disfmarker} that 's my guy . Alright .\ngrad f: You {disfmarker} you read email {pause} in VI ?\nphd h: Yeah .\npostdoc a: Yeah . {vocalsound} I like VI .\nphd h: So {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} i There 's these logos {pause} that you can put at the bottom of your web page , like \" powered by VI \" .\ngrad d: Yeah .\nprofessor b: Wow .\ngrad d: I see .\nphd e: Anyway , quick question .\ngrad f: You could put wed bugs in the email .\nphd e: How m\nphd h: Yeah .\nphd e: Like , there were three meetings this time , or so\npostdoc a: Six .\nphd e: or how many ? Six ? But , no of different people . So I guess if you 're in both these types of meetings , you 'd have a lot . But {disfmarker} {vocalsound} How {disfmarker} I mean , it also depends on how many {disfmarker} Like , if we release {disfmarker} this time it 's a fairly small number of meetings , but what if we release , like , twenty - five meetings to people ? In th\ngrad f: Well , what my s expectation is , is that we 'll send out one of these emails {pause} every time a meeting has been checked and is ready .\nphd e: I don't know . Oh . Oh , OK . So this time was just the first chunk . OK .\ngrad f: So . Tha - that was my intention . It 's just {disfmarker} yeah {disfmarker} that we just happened to have a bunch all at once .\nphd e: Well , that 's a good idea .\ngrad f: I mean , maybe {disfmarker} Is that {pause} the way it 's gonna be , you think , Jane ?"}, {"chapter": 2, "start_ms": 3606000, "topic": "IBM transcriptions", "transcript_text": "postdoc a: I agree with you . It 's {disfmarker} we could do it , uh {disfmarker} I I could {disfmarker} I 'd be happy with either way , batch - wise {disfmarker} What I was thinking {disfmarker} Uh , so this one {disfmarker} That was exactly right , that we had a {disfmarker} uh , uh {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I had wanted to get the entire set of twelve hours ready . Don't have it . But , uh , this was the biggest clump I could do by a time where I thought it was reasonable .\nprofessor b: Mm - hmm .\npostdoc a: People would be able to check it and still have it ready by then . My , um {disfmarker} I was thinking that with the {pause} NSA meetings , I 'd like {disfmarker} there are three of them , and they 're {disfmarker} uh , I {disfmarker} I will have them done by Monday . Uh , unfortunately the time is later and I don't know how that 's gonna work out , but I thought it 'd be good to have that released as a clump , too , because then , {vocalsound} you know , they 're {disfmarker} they {disfmarker} they have a {disfmarker} it it 's in a category , it 's not quite so distracting to them , is what I was thinking , and it 's all in one chu But after that , when we 're caught up a bit on this process , then , um , I could imagine sending them out periodically as they become available .\nphd e: OK .\npostdoc a: I could do it either way . I mean , it 's a question of how distracting it is to the people who have to do the checking .\nprofessor b: We heard anything from IBM ? at all ?\nphd c: Uh . Let 's see . We {disfmarker} Yeah , right . So we got the transcript back from that one meeting . Everything seemed fine . Adam {pause} had a script that will {pause} put everything back together and there was {disfmarker} Well , there was one small problem but it was a simple thing to fix . And then , um , {vocalsound} we , uh {disfmarker} I sent him a pointer to three more . And so he 's {pause} off and {pause} working on those .\ngrad f: Yeah . Now we haven't actually had anyone go through that meeting , to see whether the transcript is correct and to see how much was missed and all that sort of stuff .\npostdoc a: That 's on my list .\ngrad f: So at some point we need to do that .\nphd c: Yeah .\npostdoc a: Well , that 's on my list .\nphd c: Yeah . It 's gonna have to go through our regular process .\ngrad f: I mean , the one thing I noticed is it did miss a lot of backchannels . There are a fair number of \" yeahs \" and \" uh - huhs \" that {disfmarker} it 's just {disfmarker} that aren't in there . So .\npostdoc a: Hmm .\nprofessor b: But I think {disfmarker} Yeah . Like you said , I mean , that 's {disfmarker} that 's gonna be our standard proc that 's what the transcribers are gonna be spending most of their time doing , I would imagine ,\npostdoc a: Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm , mm - hmm .\nprofessor b: once {disfmarker} once we {disfmarker}\ngrad f: Yes , absolutely . Yeah .\npostdoc a: One question about the backchannels .\nprofessor b: It 's gonna {disfmarker}\npostdoc a: Do you suppose that was because they weren't caught by the pre - segmenter ?\ngrad f: Yes , absolutely . Absolutely .\npostdoc a: Oh , interesting . Oh , interesting . OK .\ngrad f: Yeah . They 're {disfmarker} they 're not in the segmented .\npostdoc a: OK .\ngrad f: It 's not that the {pause} IBM people didn't do it .\npostdoc a: OK .\ngrad f: Just they didn't get marked .\npostdoc a: OK . So maybe when the detector for that gets better or something {disfmarker} I w I {disfmarker} There 's another issue which is this {disfmarker} we 've been , uh , contacted by University of Washington now , of course , to , um {disfmarker} We sent them the transcripts that correspond to those {pause} six meetings and they 're downloading the audio files . So they 'll be doing that . Chuck 's {disfmarker} Chuck 's , uh , put that in .\nphd c: Mm - hmm . Yeah , I pointed them to the set that Andreas put , uh , on the {vocalsound} web so th if they want to compare directly with his results they can . And , um , then once , uh , th we can also point them at the , um , uh , the original meetings and they can grab those , too , with SCP .\nphd e: Wait . So you put the reference files {disfmarker} ?\nphd c: No , no . They d they wanted the audio .\nphd e: Or the {disfmarker} ?\nphd c: Jane sent them the , uh , transcripts .\nphd e: No , I mean of the transcripts . Um . Well , we can talk about it off - line .\nphd c: Mm - hmm .\ngrad f: There 's another meeting in here , what , at four ? Right ? Yeah , so we have to finish by three forty - five .\nphd h: D d So , does Washi - does {disfmarker} does UW wanna u do this {disfmarker} wanna use this data for recognition or for something else ?\nphd c: Uh , for recognition .\nphd e: I think they 're doing w\nphd h: Oh .\nphd e: didn't they want to do language modeling on , you know , recognition - compatible transcripts\nphd h: Oh . I see .\npostdoc a: This is to show you , uh , some of the things that turn up during the checking procedure .\nprofessor b: Yeah .\nphd e: or {disfmarker} ?\npostdoc a: Um @ @ {comment} So , this is from one of the NSA meetings and , uh , i if you 're familiar with the diff format , the arrow to the left is what it was , and the arrow to the right is {pause} what it was changed to . So , um . {vocalsound} And now the first one . \" OK . So , then we started a weekly meeting . The last time , uh {disfmarker} \" And the transcriber thought \" little too much \" But , {vocalsound} uh , really , um , it was \" we learned too much \" , which makes more sense syntactically as well .\nphd h: And these {disfmarker} the parentheses were f from {disfmarker}\npostdoc a: Then {disfmarker} Oh , this {disfmarker} that 's the convention for indicating uncertain .\ngrad f: U uncertains .\npostdoc a: So the transcriber was right .\nphd h: S\npostdoc a: You know , she was uncertain about that .\nphd h: OK .\npostdoc a: So she 's right to be uncertain . And it 's also a g a good indication of the {disfmarker} of that .\nphd h: Oh . {comment} OK .\npostdoc a: The next one . This was about , uh , Claudia and {pause} she 'd been really b busy with stuff , such as waivers . Uh , OK . Um , next one . Um . {vocalsound} This was {pause} an interesting one . So the original was \" So that 's not {disfmarker} so Claudia 's not the bad master here \" , and then he laughs , but it really \" web master \" .\ngrad f: Web master .\ngrad d: Oh . {comment} Uh - oh .\npostdoc a: And then you see another type of uncertainty which is , you know , they just didn't know what to make out of that . So instead of \" split upon unknown \" , {comment} it 's \" split in principle \" .\ngrad f: Yep .\ngrad d: Jane , these are from IBM ?\ngrad f: Spit upon ?\ngrad d: The top lines ?\npostdoc a: No , no . These are {disfmarker} these are our local transcriptions of the NSA meetings .\ngrad f: No , these are {pause} ours .\npostdoc a: The transcribers {disfmarker} transcriber 's version ver versus the checked version .\ngrad d: Oh . Oh , I see .\npostdoc a: My {disfmarker} my checked version , after I go through it .\ngrad d: OK .\npostdoc a: Um , then you get down here . Um . Sometimes some speakers will insert foreign language terms . That 's the next example , the next one . The , uh , version beyond this is {disfmarker} So instead of saying \" or \" , especially those words , \" also \" and \" oder \" and some other ones . Those sneak in . Um , the next one {disfmarker}\ngrad f: That 's cool .\nphd h: Discourse markers .\npostdoc a: S\nphd h: Discourse markers .\npostdoc a: Sorry , what ? Discourse markers ? Sure . Sure , sure , sure .\nphd h: Discourse markers .\npostdoc a: And it 's {disfmarker} and it makes sense\nphd h: Yeah . Yeah .\npostdoc a: cuz it 's , like , below this {disfmarker} it 's a little subliminal there .\nphd h: Yeah . Yeah , yeah .\npostdoc a: Um . OK , the next one , uh , {vocalsound} this is a term . The problem with terminology . Description with th the transcriber has \" X as an advance \" . But really it 's \" QS in advance \" . I mean , I {disfmarker} I 've benefited from some of these , uh , cross - group meetings . OK , then you got , um , {vocalsound} uh , instead of \" from something - or - other cards \" , {comment} it 's \" for multicast \" . And instead of \" ANN system related \" , it 's \" end system related \" . This was changed to an acronym initially and it should shouldn't have been . And then , you can see here \" GPS \" was misinterpreted . It 's just totally understanda This is {disfmarker} this is a lot of jargon . Um , and the final one , the transcriber had th \" in the core network itself or the exit unknown , not the internet unknown \" . And it {disfmarker} it comes through as \" in the core network itself of the access provider , not the internet backbone core \" . Now this is a lot of {pause} terminology . And they 're generally extremely good ,\nphd h: Mmm .\npostdoc a: but , you know in this {disfmarker} this area it really does pay to , um {disfmarker} to double check and I 'm hoping that when the checked versions are run through the recognizer that you 'll see s substantial improvements in performance cuz the {disfmarker} you know , there 're a lot of these in there .\nphd h: Yeah . So how often {disfmarker} ?\ngrad f: Yeah , but I bet {disfmarker} I bet they 're acoustically challenging parts anyway , though .\npostdoc a: No , actually no .\ngrad d: Mmm .\npostdoc a: Huh - uh .\ngrad f: Oh , really ? Uh , it 's {disfmarker} Oh , so it 's just jargon .\npostdoc a: It 's jargon . Yeah . I mean this is {disfmarker} cuz , you know you don't realize in daily life how much you have top - down influences in what you 're hearing .\nphd h: Well , but {disfmarker}\npostdoc a: And it 's jar it 's jargon coupled with a foreign accent .\nphd h: But {disfmarker} but {disfmarker} But we don't {disfmarker} I mean , our language model right now doesn't know about these words anyhow . So ,\nprofessor b: Yeah .\nphd h: you know , un until you actually {pause} get a decent language model , @ @ {comment} Adam 's right .\ngrad f: It probably won't do any better .\nphd h: You probably won't notice a difference . But it 's {disfmarker} I mean , it 's definitely good that these are fixed . I mean , {vocalsound} obviously .\npostdoc a: Well , also from the standpoint of getting people 's approval ,\nprofessor b: Yeah .\npostdoc a: cuz if someone sees a page full of uh , um , barely decipherable w you know , sentences , and then is asked to approve of it or not , {vocalsound} it 's , uh , uh {disfmarker}\ngrad f: Did I say that ?\nprofessor b: Yeah .\npostdoc a: OK .\nprofessor b: Yeah . That would be a shame if people said \" well , I don't approve it because {pause} the {disfmarker} it 's not what I said \" .\ngrad f: Well , that 's exactly why I put the extra option in ,\nprofessor b: Yeah .\npostdoc a: Exactly . That 's why we discussed that .\nprofessor b: Yeah .\ngrad f: is that I was afraid people would say , \" let 's censor that because it 's wrong \" ,\nprofessor b: Yeah .\ngrad f: and I don't want them to do that ."}, {"chapter": 3, "start_ms": 4284000, "topic": "Purchasing new headphones and disk space", "transcript_text": "postdoc a: And then I also {disfmarker} the final thing I have for transcription is that I made a purchase of some other headphones\nphd h: C\npostdoc a: because of the problem of low gain in the originals . And {disfmarker} and they very much appro they mu much prefer the new ones , and actually I {disfmarker} I mean , I {disfmarker} I think that there will be fewer things to correct because of the {disfmarker} the choice . We 'd originally chosen , uh , very expensive head headsets\ngrad f: Yeah . Ugh !\npostdoc a: but , um , they 're just not as good as these , um , in this {disfmarker} with this respect to this particular task .\nphd h: Well , return the old ones .\ngrad f: It 's probably impedance matching problems .\npostdoc a: I don't know exactly ,\ngrad f: But {disfmarker}\npostdoc a: but we chose them because that 's what 's been used here by prominent projects in transcription .\nprofessor b: Could be .\npostdoc a: So it i we had every reason to think they would work .\ngrad f: Mm - hmm .\nphd h: So you have spare headsets ?\npostdoc a: Sorry , what ?\nphd h: You have spare headsets ?\ngrad f: They 're just earphones . They 're not headsets . They 're not microphones .\nphd e: Right .\nphd h: No , no . I mean , just earphones ?

No problem .\ngrad f: But if you need it , just get it .\nphd h: I just {disfmarker}\ngrad f: Come on .\nphd h: Right .\nprofessor b: Yeah . If you need it .\nphd h: Yeah .\nprofessor b: Yeah .\npostdoc a: It 'd just have to be a s a separate order {disfmarker} an added order .\ngrad d: Yeah , I still {disfmarker} I still need to get a pair , too .\nprofessor b: They 're {disfmarker} they 're {disfmarker} they 're {disfmarker} they 're pretty inexpensive .\nphd e: Yeah , that {disfmarker} We should order a cou uh , t two or three or four , actually .\nprofessor b: Yeah .\ngrad d: I 'm using one of these . Yeah .\nphd e: We have {disfmarker}\nphd h: I think I have a pair that I brought from home , but it 's f just for music listening\nprofessor b: No . Just {disfmarker} just {disfmarker} just {disfmarker} just buy them .\nphd e: Sh - Just get the model number\nphd h: and it 's not {disfmarker} Nnn . Yeah .\nprofessor b: Just buy them .\nphd e: and {disfmarker} Where do you buy these from ?\nphd h: Yeah .\npostdoc a: Cambridge SoundWorks , just down the street .\nphd e: Like {disfmarker} ? You just b go and b\npostdoc a: Yeah . They always have them in stock .\nphd e: Oh .\nprofessor b: Yeah .\nphd e: That 'd be a good idea .\nphd h: Anyway .\nprofessor b: Yeah .\ngrad f: W uh , could you email out the brand ?\npostdoc a: Oh , sure . Yeah . OK .\ngrad f: Cuz I think {disfmarker} sounds like people are interested .\ngrad d: Yeah .\nprofessor b: Yeah .\ngrad d: Definitely .\ngrad f: So .\npostdoc a: It 's made a difference in {disfmarker} in how easy . Yeah .\nprofessor b: I realized something I should talk about . So what 's the other thing on the agenda actually ?\ngrad f: Uh , the only one was Don wanted to , uh , talk about disk space yet again .\ngrad d: Yeah . u It 's short . I mean , if you wanna go , we can just throw it in at the end .\nprofessor b: No , no . Why don't you {disfmarker} why don't you go ahead since it 's short .\ngrad d: Um , well , uh .\ngrad f: Oh , I thought you meant the disk space . Yeah , we know disk space is short .\nphd h: The disk space was short . Yeah . That 's what I thought too .\nphd e: That 's a great ambiguity .\nprofessor b: Yeah .\nphd e: It 's one of these {disfmarker} it 's {disfmarker} it 's social\nprofessor b: It 's {disfmarker} I i i it i\nphd e: and , uh , discourse level\ngrad d: Yeah .\nphd e: and {disfmarker}\nprofessor b: Yeah , it 's great . Yeah ,\nphd e: Sorry .\nprofessor b: double {disfmarker} double {disfmarker}\ngrad f: Yeah , it was really goo\nphd e: See , if I had that little {pause} scratch - pad , I would have made an X there .\ngrad d: Thank you , thank you .\ngrad f: Uh , well , we 'll give you one then .\nprofessor b: Yeah .\ngrad d: Um . {vocalsound} So , um , without thinking about it , when I offered up my hard drive last week {disfmarker}\ngrad f: Oh , no .\ngrad d: Um , this is always a suspect phrase .\nphd e: It was while I was out of town .\ngrad d: But , um , no . I , uh {disfmarker} I realized that we 're going to be doing a lot of experiments , um , {vocalsound} o for this , uh , paper we 're writing , so we 're probably gonna need a lot more {disfmarker} We 're probably gonna need {vocalsound} that disk space that we had on that eighteen gig hard drive . But , um , we also have someone else coming in that 's gonna help us out with some stuff .\nprofessor b: We 've just ordered a hundred gigabytes .\ngrad d: So {disfmarker} OK . We just need to {disfmarker}\nphd e: I think we need , like , another eighteen gig disk {pause} to be safe .\nprofessor b: Well , we 're getting three thirty {disfmarker} thirty - sixes .\nphd e: So .\nprofessor b: Right ?\ngrad d: OK .\nprofessor b: That are going into the main f file server .\nphd e: OK .\nprofessor b: So .\nphd c: Markham 's ordering and they should be coming in soon .\ngrad d: W Well . So {disfmarker} so {disfmarker}\ngrad f: Soon ?\ngrad d: Yeah . I mean , I guess the thing is is , all I need is to hang it off , like , {vocalsound} the person who 's coming in , Sonali 's , computer .\nphd h: Oh , so {disfmarker} so , you mean the d the internal {disfmarker} the disks on the machines that we just got ?\ngrad d: Whew . Or we can move them .\ngrad f: No .\nphd c: These are gonna go onto Abbott .\ngrad f: Ne - new disks .\nphd h: Or extra disk ?\nprofessor b: Onto Abbott , the file server .\ngrad d: So are we gonna move the stuff off of my hard drive onto that when those come in ?\ngrad f: On {disfmarker}\nphd h: Oh , oh . OK .\ngrad f: Yeah .\nphd e: Uh , i\ngrad f: Once they come in . Sure .\ngrad d: OK . That 's fine .\nphd e: Do {disfmarker} when {disfmarker} when is this planned for {pause} roughly ?\nphd c: They should be {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I imagine next week or something .\ngrad d: OK .\nphd e: OK . So {disfmarker}\ngrad f: If you 're {disfmarker} if you 're desperate , I have some space on my drive .\ngrad d: I think if I 'm {disfmarker}\ngrad f: But I {disfmarker} I vacillate between no space free and {pause} a few gig free .\ngrad d: Yeah . I think I can find something if I 'm desperate\nphd e: Yeah .\ngrad f: So .\ngrad d: and , um , in the meantime I 'll just hold out .\ngrad f: OK .\ngrad d: That was the only thing I wanted to bring up .\nphd c: It should be soon . We {disfmarker} we should {disfmarker}\ngrad d: OK .\nprofessor b: So there 's another hundred gig . So .\ngrad d: Alright . Great .\nphd h: Mm - hmm .\nprofessor b: OK . It 's great to be able to do it ,\ngrad d: That 's it .\nprofessor b: just say \" oh yeah , a hundred gig ,\nphd e: Good .\nprofessor b: no big deal \" .\ngrad d: Yeah .\ngrad f: Yeah . A hundred gig here , a hundred gig there .\nphd e: Well , each meeting is like a gig or something ,\ngrad f: It 's eventually real disk space .\nprofessor b: Yeah .\nphd e: so it 's really {disfmarker}"}, {"chapter": 4, "start_ms": 5166000, "topic": "General progress reports", "transcript_text": "professor b: We 're supposed to {vocalsound} get together and talk about , uh , where we are on things . Uh , there 's this meeting coming up , uh , and there 's also an annual report . Now , I never actually {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I was asking about this . I don't really quite understand this . She was re she was referring to it as {disfmarker} I think this actually {pause} didn't just come from her , but this is {pause} what , uh , DARPA had asked for . Um , she 's referring to it as the an annual report for the fiscal year . But of course the fiscal year starts in October , so I don't quite understand w w why we do an annual report that we 're writing in July .\nphd c: She 's either really late or really early .\ngrad f: Huh . Or she 's getting a good early start .\nprofessor b: Uh , I think basically it it 's none of those . It 's that the meeting is in July so they {disfmarker} so DARPA just said do an annual report . So . So . So anyway , I 'll be putting together stuff . I 'll do it , uh , you know , as much as I can without bothering people , just by looking at {disfmarker} at papers and status reports . I mean , the status reports you do are very helpful .\nphd h: Hmm .\nprofessor b: Uh , so I can grab stuff there . And if , uh {disfmarker} if I have some questions I 'll {disfmarker}\ngrad f: When we remember to fill them out .\nprofessor b: Yeah . If {pause} people could do it as soon as {disfmarker} as you can , if you haven't done one si recently . Uh . {vocalsound} Uh , but , you know , I 'm {disfmarker} I 'm sure before {pause} it 's all done , I 'll end up bugging people for {disfmarker} for more clarification about stuff . Um . {vocalsound} But , um , I don't know , I guess {disfmarker} I guess I know pretty much what people have been doing . We have these meetings and {disfmarker} and there 's the status reports . Uh . But , um . Um . Yeah . So that wasn't a long one . Just to tell you that . And if something {vocalsound} hasn't , uh {disfmarker} I 'll be talking to her late tomorrow afternoon , and if something hasn't been in a status report and you think it 's important thing to mention on {vocalsound} this kind of thing , uh , uh , just pop me a one - liner and {disfmarker} and {disfmarker} and I 'll {disfmarker} I 'll have it in front of me for the phone conversation .\nphd h: OK .\nprofessor b: Uh . I guess , uh , you you 're still pecking away at the {pause} demos and all that , probably .\ngrad f: Yep . And Don is {pause} gonna be helping out with that .\nprofessor b: Oh , that 's right .\ngrad f: So .\nprofessor b: OK .\ngrad f: Did you wanna talk about that this afternoon ?\ngrad d: Um .\ngrad f: Not here , but later today ?\ngrad d: We should probably talk off - line about when we 're gonna talk off - line .\ngrad f: OK . OK .\nprofessor b: OK . Yeah , I might want to get updated about it in about a week cuz , um , I 'm actually gonna have a {disfmarker} {vocalsound} a few days off the following week , a after the {disfmarker} after the picnic . So .\ngrad f: Oh , OK .\nprofessor b: That 's all I had .\ngrad f: So we were gonna do sort of status of speech transcription {disfmarker} automatic transcription , but we 're kind of running late . So .\nphd e: How long does it take you to save the data ?\ngrad f: Fifteen minutes .\nphd e: Yeah .\ngrad f: So . If you wanna do a quick\nphd e: Yeah .\ngrad f: ten minute {disfmarker}\nphd e: Guess we should stop , like , twenty of at the latest .\nprofessor b: Uh {disfmarker}\nphd e: We {disfmarker} we have another meeting coming in that they wanna record .\nprofessor b: And there 's the digits to do .\nphd e: So .\nprofessor b: So maybe {disfmarker} may maybe {disfmarker} maybe {disfmarker}\ngrad f: Yeah . Well , we can skip the digits .\nprofessor b: We could . Fi - five minute report or something .\nphd e: It 's up to you . I don't {disfmarker}\nprofessor b: Yeah , yeah .\ngrad f: Whatever you want .\nprofessor b: Well , I would love to hear about it ,\ngrad f: What do you have to say ?\nprofessor b: especially since {disfmarker}\ngrad f: I 'm interested , so {disfmarker}\nprofessor b: Yeah . Well , I 'm gonna be on the phone tomorrow , so this is just a {pause} good example of {pause} the sort of thing I 'd like to {pause} hear about .\nphd e: Wait . Why is everybody looking at me ?\nphd c: I don't know .\ngrad f: Sorry .\nprofessor b: Cuz he looked at you\nphd h: What ?\nprofessor b: and says you 're sketching .\nphd e: Uh . I 'm not sure what you were referring to .\nphd h: I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I 'm not {disfmarker} actually , I 'm not sure what {disfmarker} ? Are we supposed to have done something ?\ngrad f: No . We were just talking before about alternating the subject of the meeting .\nphd h: Oh .\nphd e: Uh - huh .\ngrad f: And this week we were gonna try to do {pause} t automatic transcription {pause} status .\nphd h: Alternating .\nphd e: I wasn't here last week . Sorry .\nphd h: Oh !\nphd e: Oh .\ngrad f: But we sort of failed .\nphd h: We did that last week . Right ?\nphd e: Hhh .\ngrad f: No .\nprofessor b: I thought we did .\ngrad f: Did we ? OK .\nphd h: Yeah . We did .\ngrad f: OK . So now {disfmarker} now we have the schedule . So next week we 'll do automatic transcription status , plus anything that 's real timely .\nphd h: OK .\nphd e: Oh . OK .\npostdoc a: OK .\nprofessor b: OK . Whew !\nphd c: Good update .\ngrad f: Whew !\nprofessor b: That was {disfmarker}\ngrad f: Dodged that bullet .\nprofessor b: Yeah . Nicely done , Liz .\npostdoc a: A woman of few words .\nprofessor b: But {disfmarker} but lots of prosody . OK . {vocalsound} OK .\ngrad f: Th\nphd h: Uh , I mean , we {disfmarker} we really haven't done anything .\ngrad f: Excuse me ?\nphd h: Sorry .\npostdoc a: Well , since last week .\nphd e: Yeah , we 're {disfmarker}\nphd h: I mean , the {disfmarker} the next thing on our agenda is to go back and look at the , um {disfmarker} {vocalsound} the automatic alignments because , uh , I got some {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I {disfmarker} I learned from Thilo what data we can use as a benchmark to see how well we 're doing on automatic alignments of the background speech {disfmarker} or , of the foreground speech with background speech .\ngrad f: Yeah .\nphd h: So .\nphd e: And then , uh , I guess , the new data that Don will start to process {disfmarker}\nphd h: But , we haven't actually {disfmarker}\nphd e: the , um {disfmarker} when he can get these {disfmarker} You know , before we were working with these segments that were all synchronous and that caused a lot of problems\nphd h: Mmm .\nphd e: because you have timed sp at {disfmarker} on either side .\ngrad f: Oh . Right , right . Mm - hmm .\nphd e: And so that 's sort of a stage - two of trying the same kinds of alignments with the tighter boundaries with them is really the next step .\ngrad f: Right .\npostdoc a: I 'll be interested .\nphd e: We did get our , um {disfmarker} I guess , good news . We got our abstract accepted for this conference , um {disfmarker} workshop , ISCA workshop , in , um , uh , New Jersey . And we sent in a very poor abstract , but they {disfmarker} very poor , very quick . Um , but we 're hoping to have a paper for that as well , which should be an interesting {disfmarker}\ngrad f: When 's it due ?\nphd e: The t paper isn't due until August . The abstracts were already due . So it 's that kind of workshop .\ngrad f: Mm - hmm .\nphd e: But , I mean , the good news is that that will have sort of the European experts in prosody {disfmarker} sort of a different crowd , and I think we 're the only people working on prosody in meetings so far , so that should be interesting .\npostdoc a: What 's the name of the meeting ?\nphd e: Uh , it 's ISCA Workshop on Prosody in Speech Recognition and Understanding , or something like that {disfmarker}\nphd h: It 's called Prosody to {disfmarker}\ngrad f: Mm - hmm .\npostdoc a: Good .\nphd e: some generic {disfmarker} Uh , so it 's focused on using prosody in automatic systems and there 's a {disfmarker} um , a web page for it .\nprofessor b: Y you going to , uh , Eurospeech ? Yeah .\ngrad f: I don't have a paper\nphd h: Yeah .\ngrad f: but I 'd kinda like to go , if I could . Is that alright ?\nprofessor b: We 'll discuss it .\ngrad f: OK . {vocalsound} I guess that 's \" no \" .\nprofessor b: My {disfmarker} my {disfmarker} my car {disfmarker} my car needs a good wash , by the way .\ngrad f: OK . Well , that th Hey , if that 's what it takes , that 's fine with me .\nprofessor b: Um .\ngrad f: I 'll pick up your dry - cleaning , too . Should we do digits ?\nprofessor b: Yeah .\ngrad f: Uh .\nphd h: Can I go next ? Because I have to leave , actually .\ngrad f: Yep . Go for it . Hmm ! Thanks . Thank you .\nprofessor b: So you get to be the one who has all the paper rustling . Right ?"}]}
