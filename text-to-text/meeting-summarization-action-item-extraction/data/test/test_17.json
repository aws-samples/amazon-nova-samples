Um right , this {disfmarker} for the purposes of this meeting {disfmarker} what this meeting is all about is um I'm gonna have some presentations from all three of you , what you've been working on for the last wee while , when you haven't been getting hit with spam on your computers and and , you know , filling out silly questionnaires and things .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: But hopefully you've been {disfmarker} actually been doing something productive . So we're gonna {disfmarker} each of you gonna give us a litt a little presentation . {vocalsound} Um .\nmarketing: Mm .\nproject manager: Then we're gonna {vocalsound} work , you know , from each of your presentations . We'll we'll uh talk about what we actually need as a final coming together of it all . Um and then we'll , yeah , we'll {gap} sort of conclude {gap} anything else comes up at the end of it .\nindustrial designer: How long is the meeting ?\nproject manager: This meeting it's not very long . It's uh probably down to about thirty five minutes now . So I want each of your presentations to not be too long , five five minutes , something like that .\nindustrial designer: Okay . {vocalsound} No problem . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Um if you haven't done a PowerPoint thingy , it doesn't matter , it it just it just says that you {disfmarker} it's {disfmarker} that's just one particular medium . If you haven't had time to prepare one , you can draw stuff on the noteboard , you can talk to us , you can {disfmarker} you know however you want to do your little presentation , basically , you can . Don't feel pressurised into using this thing . 'Cause I don't .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Uh okay . So um . You okay over there ?

Yeah .\nproject manager: are you uh b are you joining in with this meeting here\nmarketing: I uh yeah , yeah .\nproject manager: or are y or are y or are you are you just are you just uh doing some Internet shopping there ? {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Think she's finishing up her presentation .\nmarketing: D I mean , I I'm finishing off my presentation .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: No no . {vocalsound} Uh I'm done . Okay .\nproject manager: Okay , jolly good . Alright , let's have um {disfmarker} well , we all know that it's it's a remote control that we're gonna be dealing with .\nmarketing: Mm ."}, {"chapter": 2, "start_ms": 414000, "topic": "Industrial Designer's presentation on the working design of the remote control", "transcript_text": "project manager: I think the first thing we should look at is um {vocalsound} probably the um what it is that it is actually supposed to be . So that's gonna be you Catherine ,\nindustrial designer: Okay .\nproject manager: if we wanna hear from you first .\nindustrial designer: Okay . Um just connecting this .\nproject manager: You don't have to worry about screwing it in just {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: Are we getting i Really ?\nproject manager: there you go .\nindustrial designer: Okay . Cool . Okay . So I've got a very quick uh {disfmarker} Uh . Okay .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: So the working design , I've got a very quick presentation on this , so um I've {disfmarker} oh no , you can't see a thing . {vocalsound} Oh well , I'm gonna draw it on the board then . It's in blue uh , and I couldn't change it .\nuser interface: Oh . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Ah .\nindustrial designer: We it's fine on my screen , but never mind . So um {vocalsound} the idea is that we've got the energy source um , which in our case will pr , oh well {disfmarker} okay , never mind . So um I think maybe uh two batteries , I dunno what they're called {gap} six , or something like that .\nproject manager: Mm-hmm .\nindustrial designer: Uh and then {vocalsound} um then on the uh remote control itself will have um the sender for the signal , which could be uh an infra-red signal , um which will be sent by an electronic chip . And uh the chip will be controlled by the user interface . So we'll hear about that later from Gabriel .\nproject manager: Mm-hmm .\nindustrial designer: And uh the sender will send to the telly itself an infra-red signal to tell it to switch on or switch channels . Um and that's it really for the working design .\nproject manager: Great . Okay .\nindustrial designer: Sorry the presentation wasn't very uh clear but {disfmarker}\nproject manager: I prefer the pe I prefer the human touch personally .\nindustrial designer: Really ? Cool .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Um , should I erase this or {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Do you wanna just give us a moment , I just wanna copy this down .\nindustrial designer: Okay .\nproject manager: Um I dunno if you guys have got any questions for Catherine on any of this ?\nindustrial designer: Fine . {vocalsound} Or suggestions ?\nmarketing: Is a battery like the only way of {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: Well , it's just , you don't want it plugged in really , s\nuser interface: Yeah , alternate energy source , like win wind power or {disfmarker}\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Yeah , you blow on it and i {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: In indoors . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: No , no {disfmarker}\nuser interface: {vocalsound} Bicycle power .\nmarketing: No I meant like {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: No 'cause like cha 'cause {disfmarker} always changing um um batteries can get like annoying .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: The battery's down and {disfmarker} maybe {vocalsound} , I dunno , solar charged ? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I dunno , swi I th I th I think changing your batteries once every six months is not really a pain , but {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Yeah , it's worked for the last fifty years you know .\nmarketing: Mm . Yeah .\nuser interface: One question I have , and I don't know how much control we have over this is um , as far as the infra-red signal , do we have control over , you know , how far away you can be from the receiving unit , the the T_V_ , and still have it be operational ? I mean , maybe we want one with a strong signal stream .\nproject manager: How far away is your television ?\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nproject manager: It's never gonna be more than it's never gonna be , you kno unless you've got a T_V_ the size of a football pitch , it's not {disfmarker} doesn't have to go that far ,\nuser interface: Uh {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: Well , the thing is uh you you don't {disfmarker}\nproject manager: does it ? Doesn't have to go through a wall , because you're not gonna be looking through a wall .\nuser interface: That's true .\nmarketing: Yeah , but if like you're on the phone in the other room and you need turn television off or something and you don't really want to go into the {disfmarker} put the telephone down , and go into the other room . {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Well , we can make the the signal strong enough to go through walls if if you fancy it . I didn't think about that but {disfmarker}\nmarketing: How about Bluetooth ? {gap} Instead of using infra-red , use Bluetooth .\nindustrial designer: Why not ? I just think that it's it's gonna cost more\nmarketing: Isn't that a better signal ?\nproject manager: Yeah , yeah I d it sounds like you {gap} you w don't wanna overcomplicate things .\nindustrial designer: and I'm I'm not sure it's {disfmarker} you're gonna use it .\nmarketing: Mm {vocalsound} .\nproject manager: You know we don't need it .\nindustrial designer: It's a fancy idea uh it's quite nice , but then I don't th I dunno , either you {disfmarker} if you wanna watch the telly you're in the room ,\nproject manager: Yeah , exactly .\nindustrial designer: you are gonna {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Basically , we're we're desi we're designing and marketing a television remote control unit .\nindustrial designer: But {disfmarker}\nproject manager: We're not w w w w designing something that you can plug in a headset to and and you know connect to your laptop computer and stuff . It's uh {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Mm .\nindustrial designer: Oh , we can we can keep the idea if you i We can see at a later stage , maybe , I don't {disfmarker}\nmarketing: 'S just an idea ."}, {"chapter": 3, "start_ms": 822000, "topic": "User Interface's presentation on the layout design of the remote control", "transcript_text": "project manager: Okay . Right , well done , Catherine . Um Gab Gabriel let's uh let's hear from you on on on such things .\nuser interface: Okay .\nindustrial designer: Do you need the border ?\nuser interface: Uh I'm just gonna use the PowerPoint uh .\nindustrial designer: Okay . {vocalsound} Sorry .\nuser interface: Technical {gap} . Okay .\nmarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Okay , so , while this is warming up ,\nmarketing: Adjusting .\nuser interface: there it is uh .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nuser interface: So I'm doing the user interface design .\nproject manager: Mm-hmm .\nuser interface: Yeah , and basically uh , as far as methods , I was I was looking looking at looking at uh already existing remotes , trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there . Thinking of what we can retain , what we can do away with , uh what we what we can perfect a little bit as far as design um . {gap} we don't want to do something that's too radical of a change , I guess , I mean people want a remote that's familiar , that has their favourite functionalities um and and does the basics , but {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Mm yeah .\nuser interface: Um so we can improve what's out there and maintain that , the basic functionality that people want . Um so things that {vocalsound} seem like absolute must-haves uh would be a volume control , um so up-down keys for that , uh channel keys up-down , but then also a numerical key pad so that they can just key directly to the channel that they want , rather than doing up-down , and uh a mute button . Uh one thing that I didn't include here , that I forgot that we talked about last time , was doing um some sort of lock uh function .\nproject manager: Okay .\nuser interface: Uh , I don't I dunno , uh that's one possibility . And so in the research that I was doing there's basically two types of remotes , ones that are engineering centred and ones that are more user centred , which I don't know if I can access the web page from here , but I can show you {disfmarker} uh . Yeah . So this is a engineer centred one , so you see it's rather busy , but it also lets you play your movie , stop your movie , fast-forward , all this , um {vocalsound} freeze frame .\nproject manager: Mm-hmm .\nuser interface: Uh and this is a user centred one . Uh it's it's easier to g just glance at this and see {vocalsound} what's possible to do ,\nproject manager: Yeah .\nuser interface: you're not gonna be staring at it for five minutes .\nproject manager: Great .\nuser interface: And I {disfmarker} judging from what what we all talked about during our last meeting I kind of gathered that that's what we were going after , uh or the direction we were going in at least . Um . So , the engineering centred ones uh provide a lot of functionality , but it can be a little bit overwhelming , so the user centred ones just focus on ease of use . Uh and this sort of overlaps with what the marketing person uh , Reissa ,\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: because uh we we need to find out what what people want before we make firm decisions on this .\nmarketing: Mm .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nmarketing: {gap} . {vocalsound}\nuser interface: So uh , yeah , that's me .\nproject manager: Great . Okay . Now that's I just have a q a q question for you . This w um research that you've been doing looki looking at other , you know , existing units {gap} stuff . Um have you found that anyone else has do has looked into the locking function or {disfmarker}\nuser interface: No that that that seemed like a novel idea as f as far as I know . I mean obviously another {disfmarker} {gap} exists {gap} like you like you said in in mobile phones .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nuser interface: That was sort of the inspiration for it . Um I've never seen that with {disfmarker} in in all my years in in the remote business .\nproject manager: Yeah . {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nuser interface: I've , haven't I've never seen a locking functionality . I dunno , what uh do you guys have a a yea or nay on that {gap} a feeling about whether that's really necessary ?\nproject manager: Um {disfmarker} I would say it's {disfmarker} If it's simple to do , which I think it probably should be ,\nuser interface: Yeah .\nproject manager: even if it's a physical , you know , a f a like a f a physical switch or a physical cover for the remote , even something like that , um then yes ,\nuser interface: Mm-hmm . 'Kay .\nproject manager: it's {gap} like , you know , like s you said earlier on ab ab ab a flip thing , something like that ,\nuser interface: Right .\nproject manager: but you know being physical . Look into . Um I've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred {vocalsound} well , something we should take into account is um we've gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit . It's gotta d look like it's in the R_ and R_ .\nuser interface: Mm {vocalsound} .\nproject manager: You know , the the company it's it's , from what I can see from our other products , are yellow with blue writing on them . Um .\nmarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Mm .\nuser interface: Right . And our motto is is we put the fashion in electronics .\nproject manager: We put the fashion in electronics . There you go .\nuser interface: I think I think we have to carry that mental .\nmarketing: Mm .\nproject manager: So it's kinda gotta look it's gotta look new and s you know something fashionable . If if remote control {disfmarker} well , if telephones can be fashionable , then maybe remote control units can be .\nuser interface: Mm .\nmarketing: Mm .\nuser interface: Well yeah these , I think , we can {disfmarker} so we talked about the layout in my presentation and what I didn't mention yet really is is the sort of like the ergonomic design .\nproject manager: Yeah . Because we need {disfmarker}\nuser interface: I t I think we can make big improvements over these two that you see here , I mean .\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . Great .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Uh , everything is going t ergonomic , you know , there's you know mice for your computers that are very ergonomic and keyboards and that could be one of our niches p sort of uh uh in the market , I guess . Um .\nproject manager: Okay , fantastic .\nmarketing: Okay .\nproject manager: Right , well done , Gabriel .\nmarketing: {gap} .\nproject manager: Um Reissa . Let's plug you in , baby .\nmarketing: Where does it go into ?\nuser interface: {gap} .\nmarketing: Here ?\nuser interface: Yeah .\nmarketing: The blue thing .\nuser interface: Uh , yeah , this is getting all {gap} .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Mm . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {gap} .\nuser interface: Yeah , then you just have to do function F_ eight and it should come up .\nmarketing: Well , function F_ eight . No {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Yeah , w it it just takes a wee while .\nuser interface: Yeah , it just takes a second uh ."}, {"chapter": 4, "start_ms": 1284000, "topic": "Marketing's presentation on the user experience survey and potential user-friendly functionalities", "transcript_text": "marketing: oh . {vocalsound} Come on . Right . Okay . {gap} . Okay . Well , for our marketing report uh we observed remote control users in a usability lab , and also gave {disfmarker} so this is research {disfmarker} and we also gave participants um questionnaires to fill out . Um total number of people tested were a hundred just so you know , so that hundred people were tested and these were the findings . So seventy five per cent of users find the remote control ugly . Okay , so they don't like the look of the remote control . Um eighty f eighty per cent of them would spend more money if the rem remote control looked really cool and fancy . So I think we all agree with that . Um {vocalsound} current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user . So , they don't like {disfmarker} like the way they operate it doesn't like match how people behave . Um {gap} per cent of the users say that they only use ten per cent of the buttons on a remote , so probably if you have like one , two , three , four , five , the whole up to z ten , they probably don't use those , they only use the up and down channel .\nproject manager: 'Cause we've only got five channels . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {gap} {vocalsound} exactly .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound} That's another thing . {vocalsound} Um seventy five per cent of users say they zap . Not quite sure what they mean , zap , goes like {vocalsound} .\nproject manager: I think that's k flicking quickly between channels .\nuser interface: Yeah , you wanna navigate the channels quickly I guess .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nmarketing: Mm . Um takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote . I think especially for uh the older generation . I know my grandmother doesn't like mobile phones , takes ages to work how to use . Anyway um and they also {disfmarker} remotes often get lost in the room , so nobody can find them .\nuser interface: Mm .\nmarketing: {vocalsound} So maybe tracking devices is a good idea .\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Wow .\nmarketing: Um personal preferences . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: You are a child of technology , aren't you ? {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Um so yeah um {vocalsound} I was thinking something easy to use , especially for older people . Um {vocalsound} has to look really cool , flashy groovy for people to buy it . And it's easy to find {vocalsound} , so I don't know whether maybe {disfmarker} and also we asked them whether they wanted {vocalsound} {disfmarker} whether they'd be interested in um {vocalsound} voice activating .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: So voice activation . So and this was what we came up with . Then if you look fifteen to twenty five {disfmarker} this is age , sorry , {gap} age groups . So fifteen to twenty five said like ninety two {disfmarker} ninety one per cent of them said yes .\nproject manager: So there you go , yeah .\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Um {vocalsound} so basically the majority except for the forty five to fifty five year olds for some reason didn't want a voice activated one . And neither did the older generation , but the younger generation who we are catering for , like who have most of the money nowadays , do want a voice act speech recognition in a remote .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Uh but do the younger generation have the money ? They they don't .\nuser interface: No I would I would say the older the older people , yeah .\nproject manager: It's older generation , they're the ones that have gone out and {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Well the twenty five to thirty five year old , and thirty five , and the thirty five to forty five , forty five point seven per cent {gap} say no , so {disfmarker}\nproject manager: People people from the age of thirty f there's a big drop off there .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: For people up to the age of thirty five , you're kinda saying , yeah , they want it . Um but no they're not {gap} sort of {disfmarker} most people that have the money are people from the age of thirty five to fifty five ,\nuser interface: Yeah , that would be my guess as well .\nproject manager: uh 'cause they're the ones that have been working for twenty years .\nmarketing: So they don't {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Um {vocalsound} d and tha\nmarketing: Well {disfmarker}\nproject manager: and that's a {vocalsound} that's quite a minority there , so yeah , it's not even like fifty fifty that's th thirty five per cent .\nmarketing: These guys are growing up . {vocalsound}\nuser interface: What about just from the the prospective of our manufacturing cost ? I mean if if it's twelve fifty per unit .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nuser interface: I mean , okay , there's {disfmarker}\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Voice activation might not be the best .\nproject manager: I would say scra I'd say scrap that straight off .\nuser interface: Uh .\nmarketing: Um also with um with buttons , {vocalsound} a thing called R_S_I_ , so wrist sense {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Repetitive strain uh rep repetitive strain injury\nmarketing: Huh ?\nuser interface: or like from doing {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Yeah , repetitive strains injury , so they don't {disfmarker} I think people who watch T_V_ maybe too often , keep changing channel hurts their wrist .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} Well {vocalsound} maybe they shouldn't watch so much T_V_ then . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound} I don't think so . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So y so it's so it's so you got {disfmarker}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: so that's something we should have a look into then i when desi when designing the ergonomics of {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Yeah {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Mm .\nmarketing: maybe not so hard .\nuser interface: Mm .\nproject manager: see {vocalsound} have a look if um there's any w any medical background we can find out about this .\nindustrial designer: Maybe it could be , instead of pressing button it could be just touching a {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: Let's jus {gap}\nmarketing: Maybe {disfmarker}\nproject manager: we just want {disfmarker} need to cover our arses so that people aren't gonna sue us in ten years' time , say your remote control gave me repetitive strain injury .\nuser interface: Yeah , we should probably consult with our legal department uh .\nmarketing: Mm .\nproject manager: Yeah . {vocalsound} They're having a lunch break at the moment , but {disfmarker} yeah .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nproject manager: I'll see if I can get {disfmarker} see if I can get hold of them for the next meeting .\nuser interface: Yeah . I think we can do some really {disfmarker} in in that department , the the ergonomic department , we can make some some really good improvements .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nmarketing: Mm . Maybe th the buttons not so high up so you don't have to press so much ,\nuser interface: Mm .\nmarketing: or we just like flat buttons , something . Yeah .\nproject manager: Okay .\nmarketing: So that is me ."}, {"chapter": 5, "start_ms": 1728000, "topic": "Summary and conclusion of the three presentations", "transcript_text": "project manager: That's great , thank you very much for that , Reissa . {vocalsound} Um okay , so we've basically we've decide we've d we've decided that it's gonna be , you know uh , we're going for a basic television remote . It's gotta be safe to use , it's gotta look cool .\nmarketing: Mm .\nproject manager: It's gotta be cheap . S um .\nmarketing: Mm .\nproject manager: Now going back to the uh industrial design of it , you know , we were looking at whether to use maybe infra-red or Bluetooth . I think , we should just go with the simplest option on everything , uh and that would be infra-red , energy source , that would be batteries . Uh mean we we can look into using the s , you know , the little tiny weeny batteries , all like special long-lasting batteries . Um . {vocalsound} But a in {disfmarker} there's no I don't think there's any point in making a remote control unit that's gonna last for fifty years , because technology will have changed and , you know , we won't have televisions in ten years' time . {vocalsound} So {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: Yep .\nproject manager: I think we're all um pretty sussed on that .
