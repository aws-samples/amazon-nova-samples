Soon as I get this . Okay . This is our last meeting . Um I'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting . Uh and then we'll have a , the prototype presentation . {vocalsound} Um then we will um do an evaluation . Uh or we'll see what , what we need to have under the criteria for the evaluation . Then we'll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget . Um then we'll do the evaluation , and then we can finish up after that with um any changes that we'll need to make , or hopefully everything will fall right in line . Um let's see , minutes from the last meeting . Um we looked at uh the the trends . We had uh the fashion trends that people want a fancy look-and-feel . It was twice as important as anything else . Um they liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles . Um and a spongy feel . So we were talking about trying to incorporate those into our prototype . Um they wanted limited buttons and simplicity . Um then we looked at the uh the method for coming up with our own remote . Um looking at other other devices . Um the iPod , we really liked the look of that . Um we also had uh the kid's remote for a simple idea . Um a two part remote , which was what were were originally looking at . Uh and then um there was talk of spee uh speech recognition um becoming more uh predominant and easier to use . But I think we've still decided not to go with that . {vocalsound} Then we looked at the components um the materials for the case , the different energy sources , the different types of chips , um and made a decision on what we were going to use to make our remote . Um and basically how , what were making for the prototype . So I'm going to leave it at that and let you guys take over .\nuser interface: The prototype discussion .\nproject manager: The prototype yeah . Do you need a {disfmarker} this ?\nuser interface: No . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Okay .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} Can try to plug that in there\nuser interface: There is our remo {gap} the banana .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: but {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Um {vocalsound} yeah basically we we st went with the colour yellow . Um working on the principle of a fruit which was mentioned , it's basically designed around a banana .\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Um but it would be held in such a fashion ,\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: where it is , obviously it wouldn't be that floppy 'cause this would be hard plastic . These would be like the rubber , the rubber grips . So that's so that would hopefully help with grip , or like the ergonomics of it . Um but all the controlling would be done with this scroll wheel . You have to use your imagination a little bit . And this here represents the screen , where you , where you'd go through .\nproject manager: Very nice .\nuser interface: And the the simplest functions would be um almost identical to an iPod , where that one way ch through channels , that way th other way through channels . Volume up and down . And then to access the more complicated functions you'd you sorta go , you press that and go through the menus . It's that that simple . That just represents the infrared uh beam . That's a simple on and off switch . Um I don't know , we could use the voice . T that blue bits should be yellow , that that'd be where the batteries would be I suppose . And um {vocalsound} that's about it . It's as simple as you , we could make it really .\nindustrial designer: Right .\nuser interface: Is there anything you want to add ?\nindustrial designer: That's what we have there . That's plastic . Plastic covered with rubber . We might uh add some more underneath here . Maybe give it , give it a form . I mean you're supposed to hold it like that , but um just if you grab it , take it from somewhere ,\nuser interface: Yeah .\nproject manager: Mm-hmm .\nindustrial designer: so {disfmarker} yeah ,\nuser interface: Doesn't make much make much difference .\nindustrial designer: you have some rub yeah .\nuser interface: You could work left-handed or right-handed I suppose .\nindustrial designer: Exactly , {gap} use both . Might as well think about {disfmarker}\nuser interface: T the actual thing might be smaller .\nindustrial designer: Th think about the button as well . Like either put either one {gap} one on either side or\nuser interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nproject manager: What but what's that button ?\nindustrial designer: not do it at all . It's a quick on-off button .\nuser interface: Just the on and off .\nproject manager: Uh , 'kay .\nindustrial designer: That's um\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: yeah I think it's pretty important . So you don't have to fiddle with that .\nproject manager: 'Kay .\nindustrial designer: Right ? Um that's not um {disfmarker}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I'd say a bit smaller would probably be nice . You wanna play with that over there .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: There you go .\nuser interface: It's you know it's flimsy 'cause it's made out of heavy Play-Doh ,\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Would you like to uh {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: Right .\nuser interface: but {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Pretty impressive .\nproject manager: Well done .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Kind of a banana .\nuser interface: And whether or not it would fall into the cost {gap} everything I suppose . With the scroll and the L_C_D_ .\nproject manager: Well luckily we are going to find out . Or not luckily . Um do you have a marketing presentation for us .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}"}, {"chapter": 2, "start_ms": 324000, "topic": "Product evaluation discussion", "transcript_text": "marketing: {vocalsound} I do . Okay . You guys are gonna help me do an evaluation of the criteria . Um . Okay . So first I'll just discuss some of the criteria that I found . Just based on the past trend reports that I was looking at earlier . And then we'll do a group evaluation of the prototype . And then we will calculate the average score to see how we did . Um so the criteria we're gonna be looking at are the complaints um that we heard from the users who were interviewed earlier . So we're gonna be doing it based on a seven point scale . And one is going to mean true , that we did actually achieve that . With seven being false , we did not achieve that . {gap} . Okay . So for the first one , we need to decide , did we solved the problem of the users who complained about an ugly remote ? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I think it's definitely different than anything else out there .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Mm .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nproject manager: So if they think that what is out there is ugly , then yes I would say , I would say most definitely .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: I would {gap} .\nproject manager: It's bright .\nuser interface: It's bright . It's {disfmarker}\nproject manager: It still has your traditional black .\nuser interface: It's curved . It's not {disfmarker} there's no sharp\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: angles to it .\nproject manager: Yep , not angular .\nmarketing: Mm .\nindustrial designer: I'd say , when it comes to the ergonomics , the form and stuff , yes that's definitely more beautiful than your average .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: However the colour , we don't have a say in that .\nmarketing: Yeah I think the colours detract a little bit . {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Some people might say it . Yeah .\nindustrial designer: That has been , that has been dictated pretty much by the company .\nproject manager: Mm .\nindustrial designer: So uh to answer that honestly I would rather say like uh , we have not solved the problem completely with the ugly remote because the colour is ugly , definitely .\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Yep .\nmarketing: That's true . Yeah .\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: 'S nothing you can say about that . I mean I much prefer something like brushed chrome with that form .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: But {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Yeah something more modern to go {disfmarker} a a modern colour to go with the modern form .\nindustrial designer: Right . Right . It's different . You don't want your uh three feet huge L_C_D_ dis display in your living room that's hanging from the wall to be controlled with something like that .\nmarketing: Um okay so , do you think , since we {disfmarker} This was a a sign criteria , do you think maybe we should put it somewhere in the middle then ?\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nmarketing: Does that sound good ?\nproject manager: Yeah .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: What do you think ? Three ? Four ?\nproject manager: I would say\nmarketing: Five ?\nproject manager: four . {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Four is fair . Okay .\nproject manager: Very non-committal , four .\nmarketing: Okay , the second one . Did we make it simple for new users ?\nindustrial designer: It's very intuitive , I think yeah .\nuser interface: Yeah . I think that was the main aim , one of the main aims that we had .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} S give it a one .\nmarketing: One ,\nproject manager: Yeah .\nmarketing: 'kay . Okay . Um , do the controls now match the operating behaviour of the users ?\nuser interface: Uh yeah . 'Cause we've we've brought it down to basically four controls {gap} most common , which are channel and volume .\nmarketing: I'd say that {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Mm-hmm .\nindustrial designer: Right .\nuser interface: And then the other ones are just a matter of just going , just scrolling further .\nproject manager: S scrolling through and selecting a few .\nindustrial designer: Right . So that's a one .\nmarketing: So one ?\nproject manager: I think that's a one .\nmarketing: Yeah ? {vocalsound} Okay . Okay um the fourth one . How about the problem of a remote being easily lost ? One of the number one complaints .\nindustrial designer: Something that big and that yellow you just don't lose anymore .\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Whether you want to or not , you're not gonna lose it . {vocalsound}\nuser interface: It's bright yellow .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Bright yellow's hard to lose . But um if we were to , if we were , that , the speech recognition . That , we could maybe just use that solely for the the finding thing . That was what we'd we'd mentioned .\nproject manager: So if we incorporate speech recognition into it then it could {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Just just to use , to find it when it was lost . But like I said , like I don't think you'd lose something so yellow so easily .\nindustrial designer: Oops . Hmm .\nuser interface: And it's not gonna fall , like a rectangle would slip down behind things . That's gonna be a difficult shape to {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: Well what {disfmarker}\nproject manager: And it is quite bright and {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Yeah .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Maybe in the middle again , three or four or something ?\nproject manager: Uh {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: S\nmarketing: Okay .\nuser interface: I mean you know {gap} loo losing things is one of those things that people can lose , I mean a million ways .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nuser interface: You can pick it up and walk away with it and then you've lost it .\nindustrial designer: Mm .\nmarketing: That's true .\nproject manager: But if we do go with the , with the speech recognition , then it , then our scale goes up quite a bit I think .\nmarketing: Mm .\nindustrial designer: Oh yeah . You probably {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Yeah .\nproject manager: Probably two . You know . If we eliminate the fact that you know it's impossible to guarantee that it's not gonna be lost then\nuser interface: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Mm .\nproject manager: I'd say two .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: With the speech recognition , which of course may be changed depending on budget .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Y you could add an extra feature actually . Which makes this thing raise hell when you remove it too far from the television .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: We could add that but that's nothing we have thought of so far .\nproject manager: Which , which may be cheaper than speech recognition if it were just a {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: Yes .\nuser interface: Yeah true . But I mean d just those whistling , clapping key rings you have . They're cheap .\nmarketing: Annoying alarm or something ?\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: It's it's {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Yeah .\nuser interface: So it can't be that\nindustrial designer: Um the {disfmarker} it's based on this anti anti-theft technology for suitcases and stuff ,\nuser interface: expensive .\nproject manager: Some sort of proximity {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: where you have one piece that's attached to your luggage , another piece that starts beeping . That can't cost much .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: So that can also easily be integrated because these things are small enough to to hide , so you have one piece , you have to glue somewhere behind your {disfmarker} stick it behind your T_V_ and the other {disfmarker}\nuser interface: {gap} stick it on the T_V_ {gap} .\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Pray that you don't accidentally lose that piece . {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Right .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: That'd be tough then . {vocalsound} Well also your remote would uh alarm you if somebody stole you t your television , yeah . Ran off with it without taking the beautiful remote control .\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: So . Are we adding one of these two features ?\nindustrial designer: Let's add one of those features and say yes . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {gap} gonna say {disfmarker} okay .\nproject manager: Okay .\nmarketing: So we're {vocalsound} back to a one ?\nuser interface: Two .\nmarketing: Or a two ?\nproject manager: Two .\nindustrial designer: Two .\nmarketing: Two , 'kay . Okay . Are we technologically innovative ?\nindustrial designer: Uh {disfmarker}\nuser interface: {vocalsound} I'd say so .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Uh don't get many mo remote controls with\nindustrial designer: It's all just {disfmarker}\nuser interface: screens on .\nindustrial designer: It's all just stolen technology when it comes down to {disfmarker} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah it's stolen technology .\nmarketing: From iPod yeah . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: It's {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nuser interface: But we have {gap} .\nproject manager: But there's not a lot of yellow , there's not a lotta yellow .\nindustrial designer: right\nmarketing: But for remotes {disfmarker} yeah .\nproject manager: Course that wasn't really {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: right\nuser interface: Fa\nindustrial designer: right right .\nproject manager: we were kinda forced to take that colour .\nmarketing: Two ? Three ?\nuser interface: {gap} 'cause it's stolen .\nproject manager: I don't know that we are that innovative , to tell you the truth . {vocalsound}\nuser interface: No maybe not .\nindustrial designer: Yeah not really .\nmarketing: But how many remotes do you see like this ?\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: If we added the screaming factor {vocalsound} then we go up .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Not so many .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Um I would say we're probably at four .\nindustrial designer: Right .\nmarketing: Really ? Okay . {vocalsound} That's gonna hurt us .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Okay . Um spongy material ?\nindustrial designer: Yeah well you have that , kind of , sort of .\nproject manager: We have some spongy , yeah .\nuser interface: Yeah as much as as needed , I think .\nmarketing: 'Kay .\nindustrial designer: It's not a one though .\nproject manager: No .\nindustrial designer: One would be the whole thing\nproject manager: Yeah . Because it's only got what , these parts are the grips and perhaps the back side {disfmarker} the bottom {disfmarker} the underneath on the back .\nindustrial designer: to fold and stuff . Yeah .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: So that's a four at most .\nproject manager: Probably a four at most . Possibly even a five .\nmarketing: And lastly , did we put the fashion in electronics ?\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Y yes .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nmarketing: I'd say we did .\nproject manager: If your fashion is b is Carmen Miranda , you betcha . {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: More {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} Well the recent fashion is rather displayed in the in the L_C_D_ and the way you operate it than the form and the colour ,\nuser interface: On the {disfmarker}\nproject manager: It's true .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: but it definitely is {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Be what we were told , and they'd say yeah , definitely .\nindustrial designer: {gap} .\nmarketing: 'Kay . Alright . Now we just gotta calculate . Six eight twelve sixteen . Seventeen divided by s\nuser interface: {gap} .\nproject manager: Seven is {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Eight .\nproject manager: Two point {disfmarker}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {gap} two point four ?\nuser interface: Is that some long division ? No .\nproject manager: Something .\nmarketing: Well I haven't done math in years .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: What two {disfmarker}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound} I dunno .\nuser interface: Just , I'm sure there's a {gap} .\nmarketing: Okay we'll say two point four two . Right ? How does that look ?\nindustrial designer: I'm impressed . I can't do that without a calculator . {vocalsound}\nuser interface: No I can't do long {gap}\nmarketing: {vocalsound} It's been a while .\nuser interface: very impressive .\nproject manager: And what what is the acceptable criteria ? Is there like a scale that we have to hit ?\nmarketing: Oh no . They just told me to\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound} pick my own criteria and have you guys evaluate it {vocalsound} basically .\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Alright then .\nmarketing: So that's that .\nproject manager: Okay . Well , let's see .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}"}, {"chapter": 3, "start_ms": 1704000, "topic": "Product cost discussion", "transcript_text": "project manager: Now we get to do the budget numbers . You didn't know that you were gonna have a budget . But we do . Okay .\nuser interface: Yeah . Yeah so . You'd been going a long time dividing that . It's two point four two eight five se it just keeps going on .\nmarketing: Oh my god .\nuser interface: Two point four two basically .\nmarketing: Okay . Yeah we'll go with that .\nproject manager: So I have here an {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} Fifty percent , you're kidding .\nmarketing: Not too shabby .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} P\nproject manager: We want a fifty percent profit on this . Oh you can't really see that very well .\nuser interface: {vocalsound} Charge about three hundred quid for it .\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Twelve and a half Euros is what supposed to cost us . Okay , so {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: It's too much .\nproject manager: Well let's see .\nindustrial designer: Um {disfmarker}\nproject manager: The f the {disfmarker} Wonder if I can make this {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: Uh {disfmarker}\nproject manager: What the {disfmarker} {vocalsound} Oh it won't let me do that . Okay . Alright so at top , I don't know if you guys can read that or not . I can't 'cause I don't have my glasses on ,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: but so we've got the energy source . There's uh four , five , six categories .\nindustrial designer: Battery .\nproject manager: We have energy source , electronics , case . Then we have case material supplements , interface type , and then button supplements . Okay so {disfmarker} Uh first of all energy source , we picked battery . Um and how many batteries do we think this will probably take ?\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Probably some e either two or four .\nindustrial designer: Two .\nproject manager: Two ? {vocalsound} Like it . {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: At four it's gonna be too heavy , so that that's not our problem . People can change it every month .\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Excellent .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} They won't know until after they bought it .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: This is consumerism .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Alright so for the electronics our choices are simpl simple chip-on-print , regular chip-on-print , advanced chip-on-print , sample sensor , sample speaker .\nindustrial designer: {gap} .\nuser interface: We're advanced chip are we ?\nindustrial designer: That's the advanced chip-on-print , yeah .\nproject manager: 'Kay , {gap} we have one of those . 'Kay then the case is a {disfmarker} Probably it's double curved .\nindustrial designer: Double curved , yes .\nproject manager: Case materials are\nindustrial designer: Plastic .\nproject manager: plastic . Um I guess it's two , since one for the top , one for the bottom .\nindustrial designer: N no .\nproject manager: Is that right or is it just one ?\nindustrial designer: No that's just one .\nproject manager: Maybe it's one because of the {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: It's just one mo single mould , we can do that .\nproject manager: 'Kay .\nuser interface: Yeah {gap} yeah .\nmarketing: Right . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I guess it doesn't matter 'cause the price on that one is zero , which is nice .\nindustrial designer: Exactly , right .\nmarketing: Oh .\nproject manager: Special colour ?\nindustrial designer: That's not a special colour . It's a specially ugly colour , but it's not special .\nmarketing: Bright yellow .\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Interface type . We have pushbutton , scroll-wheel interface , integrated scroll-wheel pushbutton , and an L_C_D_ display .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: S\nindustrial designer: S {vocalsound}\nuser interface: That's {disfmarker} Yeah .\nproject manager: So we actually have the L_C_D_ display\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: And then {disfmarker}\nproject manager: and then is it the integrated or is it {disfmarker}\nuser interface: I'd say the integrated .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Yes unfortunately .\nproject manager: 'Kay . Button supplement ? Special colour ?\nuser interface: Mm .\nproject manager: Um special form ? Special material .\nindustrial designer: We could of course make the buttons wood .\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} Say mahogany or so\nmarketing: {vocalsound} It'd look really lovely .\nproject manager: Or titanium .\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm or titanium .\nproject manager: They cost us all the same .\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nuser interface: {gap} remote control {gap} .\nproject manager: Well we only have one button so really we shouldn't be charged ,\nindustrial designer: Uh just {disfmarker}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound} we shouldn't be charged anything for the the button supplements .\nuser interface: No that's getting a bit tiny .\nproject manager: Um {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Yeah .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: I'd ignore that .\nmarketing: Leave it blank .\nproject manager: Okay . We're gonna leave that one blank because we run on a L_C_D_ and scroll . So our total is fifteen point five . Which I believe is\nindustrial designer: Yeah that's too much .\nproject manager: by three Euros over .\nindustrial designer: It's hard to believe . So we'll go for the hand dynamo huh ? {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So the only thing better than um a banana-shaped remote is one that you shake .\nuser interface: If it w What if we completely took out the the one single button we've got on .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: And just had a scroll wheel interface . And the L_C_D_ display . I suppose the L_C_D_ C_ display's the one that's pushing it up a bit though .\nproject manager: Yeah 'cause the {disfmarker}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Well 'cause we have to have both right ?\nuser interface: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: I mean let's let's face it , it also depends on the software on the on the television .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: You can have the the information that this thing transmits be being displayed on the on the screen .\nproject manager: Mm-hmm .\nindustrial designer: So s yeah let's take away the {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Yeah you could maybe take out the L_C_D_ dis display even ,\nindustrial designer: Yeah . Yeah .\nuser interface: if it if it comes up on the computer itsel on the T_V_ itself .\nindustrial designer: Right .\nproject manager: So we may not need the L_C_D_ display ?\nuser interface: Uh that is possible yeah .\nindustrial designer: Right . We may not need it . There you go .\nproject manager: Well there we go .\nindustrial designer: Perfect .\nproject manager: Twelve point five .\nuser interface: There we go .\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Perfect .\nproject manager: Okay . So we just remove our {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Screen .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: screen here .\nuser interface: Make it a bigger dial .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Easier to use . Even easier to use then .\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} Okay , the {disfmarker}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Besides look at what the L_C_D_ does to our lovely remote .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Back to the design room boys .\nindustrial designer: So we can just take away a heck of a lot of the {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {gap} .\nindustrial designer: there you go . {gap} central ?\nmarketing: What's the blue part ?\nuser interface: That was just {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: Oh that's just {disfmarker}\nuser interface: we ran out of yellow . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Oh that's the batteries .\nindustrial designer: yeah .\nmarketing: Okay . {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: There you go\nuser interface: There you go .\nindustrial designer: . Oops .\nuser interface: Even simpler .\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Looks more like a banana .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: There you go .\nuser interface: For all those fruit lovers out there .\nindustrial designer: One more criteria .\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Okay so the costs under twelve point five Euro . Was no . We redesigned it . Now it's yes .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Next slide . Project evaluation . Uh project process , satisfaction with , for example , room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , means , new ideas found . Um {disfmarker} So {disfmarker} I guess that {disfmarker} Let's see here . I think that perhaps the project evaluation's just supposed to be completed by me . But I'd like to hear your thoughts .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} Fair enough . {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}"}, {"chapter": 4, "start_ms": 2760000, "topic": "Project and overall process review", "transcript_text": "marketing: Trying to fill in some time there . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Uh h what did you think of our project process ? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Great . {vocalsound}\nuser interface: I think we did {disfmarker} yeah I think we did quite well . Um {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nproject manager: Good .\nmarketing: Good teamwork {gap} . {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Just half a day , you have a remote . There you go .\nuser interface: Yeah . Right from the start of the day .\nproject manager: Yeah I think {disfmarker}\nuser interface: We sort of knew where we were going straight away I thought .\nproject manager: {gap} we st we started off a little little weak . Our leadership was quite weak in the beginning .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Um {vocalsound} um {disfmarker}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: But as the day went along we had more idea of what we were doing . Um room for creativity ? There was that . Um I think we tried a lotta different things and um I think it was um interesting as you guys brought up more um information and studies that we were right on with a lot of those things . Um you guys worked together well as a team . And um the means ? Which was the whiteboard and the pens .\nuser interface: Yeah .
