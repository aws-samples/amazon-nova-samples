For uh this meeting the main agenda okay uh to discuss about the conceptual design meeting . Okay and the agenda will be the opening and uh {disfmarker} that's uh {disfmarker} the product manager or secretary that's me and uh the presentations from the Christine and uh Agnes and from Mister Ed . And finally in this meeting we have to decide\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: and we are to take a decision on the remote control concept and uh the functional design So we have forty minutes , I think it's uh little bit uh low , but I I hope we can finish it up {vocalsound} so I'll handle to the the functional team , to the Christine , okay , to discuss about uh the components concept .\nindustrial designer: Okay . So uh , if you could open the PowerPoint presentation .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I'm number two .\nproject manager: You're number two . 'Kay\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} Components design , there we go .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: So uh can we put it in slide show mode ? Yeah .\nproject manager: The next one .\nindustrial designer: Right here , is that little {disfmarker} that one , yes please .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Thank you .\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I'll take the mouse . {vocalsound} So uh\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: we were looking he specifically at the components uh {disfmarker} the following components , uh the case , the power supply , uh the means of communications with the television set . In instance we had talked about using some sort of speech recognition ,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: you have to have microphone {disfmarker} well no you don't actually I haven't {disfmarker} have to have microphone in the device , but um maybe you do have it a a way {disfmarker}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: it has to it has to hear the speaker\nuser interface: Mm-hmm .\nindustrial designer: and um , so it could be in the television set , could be in the device , but somewhere you have to put the microphone , um and a w a way of making beeps or sounds so you can find it when it's gets lost . Um so the other w thing that we {disfmarker} So . Our method for going about this is we've looked at uh the histo hi historical record , what's worked , what hasn't and then we also um {disfmarker} we wanted to evaluate some new materials\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: and we contacted manufacturing for their input because , course , we m might {vocalsound} come up and choose the material that then manufacturing didn't have the technologies or capabilities to offer us , so uh this is the approach that we took during our um {disfmarker} our research .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: So um for the case , um we told we were making a specifica specific assumption that it would be curved in design .\nmarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Course , you know , I wanted it to be expandable and shrinkable , but um that uh doesn't seem to b be one of the choic non-option we can uh {disfmarker} we can really seriously explore ,\nuser interface: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} so then we were thinking about um rubber , but um unfortunately that's been eliminated because of the heat uh factor\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: and th um there might be some {vocalsound} problems with the m uh how it's {disfmarker} {vocalsound} uh goes with the board . {vocalsound} Uh and uh then th plastic also has this problem of melting and it's brittle {disfmarker} it gets brittle after a while ,\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: so um we still had titanium and and wood available , but um unfortunately uh uh titanium's also been eliminated uh ,\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: the m people in manufacturing said that you couldn't make d curved cases out of titanium , although how {vocalsound} Apple did it with th PowerBook I'm not su quite sure but uh nevertheless um they've eliminated all of our options except wood .\nuser interface: {vocalsound} At least it's environmentally friendly . {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} So , {vocalsound} this is our finding .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: And a as she said , it's an environmentally friendly uh material , so we're {disfmarker} we're {vocalsound} currently uh proposing ,\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: uh we'll get to all my personal preferences in just a second .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: So then there's this other matter of the chips and um well we could use a simple design on the board ,\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {disfmarker} uh these simple chips , but that's only works for the bu you don't get very much um intelligence with this simple one . And um then there was the regular which {vocalsound} I regret that I've forgotten exactly why I'm eliminating that one . Uh the other option was this advanced chip on print , {vocalsound} and uh we liked th we we found that it it includes this infrared sender ,\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: which w 'member the beam was {disfmarker} that was an important component of finding the right chip .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: And uh manufacturing has told us that they've um uh recently developed a uh a sensor and a speaker that would uh be integrated into this advanced chip on print , so uh we we uh now jumping right to our personal preferences um I I'd really think we should , you know , use some of uh some really exotic woods , like um ,\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: you know uh , well you guys come from tropical countries so you can kinda think of some trees and some nice woods . I think that people will might really want to design their own cases , you see , they could do sort of a {disfmarker} this um three-dimensional design on the internet , and then they could submit their orders , kinda like you submit a custom car order , you know , and you can choose the colour and the size of the wheels and the colours of the leather and things like that , and then I uh think we should go with the solar cells as well as the um microphone and speaker on the advanced chip . So this is the findings of our research\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: and my recommendations um for the new remote control w um would be to have um have it be made out of wood . Do you have any problems with that ?\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Can you go back uh one slide ?\nindustrial designer: I'm not sure , how do I {disfmarker} Oh , I know , let's see .\nuser interface: Thank you . Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Let's go back up here .\nproject manager: Yes , uh {gap} question , uh , what's mean exactly , advanced chip on print ? What's the meaning of that ?\nindustrial designer: I think it's um um a multiple uh chip design um {vocalsound} and it's uh maybe printed on to the circuit board .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Mm-hmm .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Uh I could find out more about that uh before the next fi next meeting .\nproject manager: Yeah , is it means it's on the {disfmarker} yeah is it on a micro-proc micro-processor based or uh {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} I don't know , but I'll find out more at our next meeting .\nproject manager: Okay , tha that would be great , so if you find out from the technology background , okay , so that would be good .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Sounds good .\nuser interface: Why was the plastic eliminated as a possible material ?\nindustrial designer: Because um it gets brittle , cracks {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Mm-hmm .\nindustrial designer: Um We want {disfmarker} we expect these um {vocalsound} uh these remote controls to be around for several hundred years . So . {vocalsound} Good ex {vocalsound} {gap} Good expression . {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound} Whic\nmarketing: Wow ,\nuser interface: {vocalsound} Which {disfmarker}\nmarketing: {vocalsound} good expression . Well after us . {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I don't know , speak for yourself , I'm planning to be around for a while . {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Although I think {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: I think with wood though you'd run into the same types of problems , wouldn't you , I mean it chips , it if you drop it ,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: uh it's {disfmarker} I'm not su {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So {gap} so you're not convinced about the the wood , yes .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} {gap} you're what ?\nmarketing: Actually , I'm ready to sell it .\nuser interface: I think {vocalsound} if you re if you use really good quality wood , then it might work ,\nmarketing: I'm ready to sell it .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} You think ? {vocalsound} And you could {disfmarker} you could sell oils with it , to take care of it .\nuser interface: but you can't just use {disfmarker}\nmarketing: No y {vocalsound} no no no , the o the only w the only wood you can use are the ones that are hard , extremely hard wood ,\nuser interface: Yeah , exactly , yeah .\nmarketing: but there are some very pretty woods out there {vocalsound} .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} Well I'm glad you {disfmarker}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: That's actually very innovative idea .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} Okay , good .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} Sorr having a hard time keeping wi control over my face . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Well , it's actually a very innovative n different idea that uh you know you can choose your colour of wood , your type of wood .\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm .\nuser interface: The stain .\nmarketing: {vocalsound} I mean it's {disfmarker} each person is gonna have their own personalised , individualised speech recognition remote control in wood , that's not on the market .\nindustrial designer: Mm .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yeah , so it it's looks good the the design the functional design uh , what about yo you ?\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound} Um , in terms of comments on this or in terms of my own {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Yes , in t yes , in term in terms of comments first {disfmarker}\nmarketing: {vocalsound} In turns of wow . {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: She works in the cubicle next to me so she's uh she was already a little bit prepared for this {vocalsound} .\nuser interface: Y yeah .\nmarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Luckily Ed was not . {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Wood ? {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound} I think we can get the quality materials then {vocalsound} it shouldn't influence the design principles too much , which you'll see with my presentation .\nmarketing: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nuser interface: One thing we'd have to check though is what the users {disfmarker} whether {disfmarker} how quickly the novelty wears off of having uh {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm . Yeah , you wouldn't wanna have to have splinters in your hand while you're using your {disfmarker}\nuser interface: {disfmarker} Yeah , for example . {vocalsound} So , have to see how kid-friendly it is and and all that ,\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} It's really good if your dog gets ahold of it , they can use it {vocalsound} {gap} for teething .\nuser interface: but {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: They do that anyway with the rubber and plastic ,\nindustrial designer: Yeah , they do it with other materials as well , yeah .\nmarketing: so {vocalsound} , and chew 'em up . And chew 'em up .\nproject manager: Okay then , uh , let's move to Agnes .\nproject manager: so we can have a tie-up with who the do the fabric , okay , for the different uh electronics items , then we can have a business tie-up and to get {disfmarker} to cut the cost , okay , to sell more . So , but uh le let's decide first about the components concept and uh interface concept , okay , if is acceptable for both of you , what uh Ed was talking . And your design {vocalsound} whether you want with the display or without display or just a simple , so\nuser interface: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound} I think it depends , I mean I think it's a good idea , but we need to really think about how useful it's gonna be because theoretically with the T_V_ you already have a big display {vocalsound} right in front of you .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Hmm .\nuser interface: So , if we're trying to keep costs down , then maybe sacrificing the display is a way to go .\nindustrial designer: Hmm .\nuser interface: I mean it depends on how much putting a display costs and what it would be used for {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: Hmm .\nuser interface: very specifically what it would be used for ,\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm .\nuser interface: 'cause if it's only used for one little thing , then putting in a big display case or a big display that's probably expensive just to do the training on the chip for the speech recognition or whatever , may not be the most cost-efficient way to go ,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: but that's just sort of speculation , I mean .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} What do you think Ed ? Do you {disfmarker} he liked the display in one of the concepts that you showed , um , do you know how much it costs , um , to to add a little display like this uh ?\nmarketing: {vocalsound} No . No\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} Do you wanna take an action item to go find out ?\nmarketing: {gap} no p spec {vocalsound} It's 'cause we have to find out cost on it .\nindustrial designer: Okay . {vocalsound} Sorry about that .\nmarketing: Um , no that's no problem . I'm here for the {vocalsound} pushing it after it's made . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Yes .\nmarketing: I will market it . {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Once we get a price on it then we can market it .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound} So the {vocalsound} the advanced chip on print is what um what we've {vocalsound} we've deci we've determined\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: and the uh engineering industrial design is the recommendation , and um I think we've kinda come to some agreement regarding um this concept of a wooden case .\nproject manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: A customisable and {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Nice beautiful mahogany red wooden case . {vocalsound}\nuser interface: What about the buttons , would {disfmarker} Would the buttons be wood too , or {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} Uh I don't think so , no ,\nproject manager: I don't think so .\nindustrial designer: I think they could be rubber like they are now ,\nproject manager: Yes . Yes .\nindustrial designer: so you have that tactile experience of {disfmarker}"}, {"chapter": 2, "start_ms": 900000, "topic": "Layout of the general functionality of the new product", "transcript_text": "user interface: I think so , yeah . Yeah , that's the one . So , it's a very short presentation , 'cause I'm actually gonna draw you the layout on the board so if you want to just go straight to the second slide , um , which basically shows , sort of {disfmarker}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: I took the ideas that we were talking about last time um and tried to put that into the remote control so the things that y you can actually see on it are the on off switch , volume and channel control , the menu access button , ergonomic shape , which I completely agree with Christine's idea to have it sort of molded , so it's slightly more ergonomic and comfortable to hold than the r standard very straight remote controls . And actually the other thing with the wood if we take your customising idea , is that people can actually do sort of quasi-measurements on their hand size , so if someone has larger hands , you have a wider remote control .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} Right , my hand is uh different size than yours for example .\nuser interface: {vocalsound} So , that's actually a really good idea for customi customisability . Um , one thing I thought might be kind of interesting is to put a flip screen on it , just like you have on flip phones ,\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: so that you don't have this case where someone sits on the remote control or accidentally puts their hand on it , especially if you have little kids around , they're not pressing the buttons while you're trying to watch a T_V_ show and accidentally change the channel or turn it off .\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm .\nuser interface: And also {vocalsound} um you had issues with the batteries running out ,\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: so I thought maybe we could put a little battery life-light on it that kind of goes dimmer and dimmer and dimmer as your battery is {disfmarker} starts to die . And in terms of invisible features , audio and um tactile feedback on button presses and , like you said , speech recognition .\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm .\nuser interface: So , in terms of what this thing would actually look like {disfmarker}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Despite working in interface design , I'm not the greatest artist in the world , so you'll have to forgive me . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} You'd have something like this with an on-off switch fairly big , sort of in the corner and by itself , so you don't accidentally turn your T_V_ off while you're trying to manoeuvre other buttons . And then you have sort of one of those toggle displays for , oops , channels and volume , sort of for surfing channels and then volume , so the volume would be the up and down , 'cause volume goes up and down and then channels left to right . And then here you'd have your sort of standard , telephonish number pad . {vocalsound} And then on one side you would have an access to the menu on your T_V_\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: and on the other side a way to turn off the voice control . So that if the user doesn't want to use their voice , they can just turn it off and you don't have the remote control accidentally changing things on you .\nindustrial designer: Mm . Mm-hmm .\nuser interface: {vocalsound} Um , so again you can have a little L_C_D_ light somewhere , the flip {vocalsound} thing and {disfmarker} Have I forgotten anything ? I don't think so . So , as you can see , it's a very very simple design ,\nmarketing: No . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: which is one of the things I really wanted to keep , is keep it simple , not have too many buttons , not have too many functionalities thrown into it . Think the design can pretty much carry over to everything , although with the wood the flip screen might have to do something slightly different .\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: A hinge . Be like a copper hinge or you know .\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah . But you also have to d start watching out for the weight , 'cause depending on how much the the flip screen will add to the weight of the remote control , you don't want it to start getting too heavy .\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm . Mm .\nuser interface: But that's the general layout with the general functionalities , if we come up with something else . As you can see , there's still lots of space on the actual remote control and if you do it customisably , {vocalsound} you can make this thing fairly small or fairly o large , depending on personal preferences .\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Hmm .\nuser interface: So , that's pretty much {vocalsound} all I had to say , I mean , everything else in terms of design issues . Um the centering of the key pad and {vocalsound} the channel is just depending on where your thumb is and you tend to use the the volume control and uh the browsing more than the actual number pad , so that would be sort of in direct line of where your thumb goes when you are holding the remote control ,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} Mm-hmm .\nuser interface: the number pad a little bit lower 'cause it's used less frequently .\nindustrial designer: Mm . Mm-hmm .\nuser interface: So once we decide exactly what we want , then we can figure out the exact positioning , but more or less I think it should go along those lines .\nproject manager: {vocalsound} So what's your , uh , the comments or uh s\nmarketing: Simple design . It's what consumers want .\nproject manager: Okay\nmarketing: It's almost like , Houston , we have a product here . {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Problem is obviously gonna be cost .\nuser interface: Mm-hmm ."}, {"chapter": 3, "start_ms": 1158000, "topic": "Market trend reflecting user requirement", "transcript_text": "marketing: Okay , I also have a f {vocalsound} very simple presentation ,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm .\nmarketing: because for the marketing point you have to see what the consumers want .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nmarketing: {vocalsound} I also have uh copied a different type of remote . If you can find me , where I'm at . {vocalsound} There should only be one in here . {gap} trend watch .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} Sure .\nmarketing: It's being modified .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound} They're stealing our product . {vocalsound} We've been giving simple {vocalsound} questionnaires in different areas because th {gap} obviously we have to see what the com consumers are looking for today , 'cause uh trends change very very quickly . In six months maybe this idea is already gone out the window , so it's gonna be a question how fast we can act . Uh they already erased the rest of mine , huh .\nindustrial designer: No ,\nuser interface: No , no .\nindustrial designer: f go to findings .\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: No no , no no . {vocalsound} 'Cause I had another comment there . Uh the market trend . This is what we know from the last uh {disfmarker} from the {vocalsound} questionnaires from the the {disfmarker} all the p surveys we've done , fancy and feel-good , that's what we've been looking for , something that feels good in the hand , that's easy to use . Looking for next generation of innovation , because all the remotes out there now , they're all very similar , they all do the same thing ,\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: we have to have something completely different . Okay ? Easy to use , has always has become {disfmarker} has become another major interest that uh , with the whiteboard we can see that it's a remote that's easy to use . And I think this is another thing that's interesting is the consumers actually willing to pay the price for exciting tel technology . So even if we have a product that may be more expensive , if it comes out right , if they {gap} look {disfmarker} it looks and feels good and has technology . The second two , you can see the last one is a very easy simple design . {vocalsound} The second one , there is about uh forty-five thousand different buttons on it , which makes it fairly hard to read , uh very hard to use .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: The first one , I see {vocalsound} that they put in a display . Now there's something else uh with the little flip-up , now we're adding all kinds of things in ,\nuser interface: Mm-hmm .\nmarketing: but with the little flip-up , if you have a little display on the flip-up that when you close it everything is locked .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nmarketing: Maybe the display also makes it easier to use , because sometimes when you're looking for buttons , maybe if you see a display {disfmarker}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Context-sensitive instructions , depending on what the tel what mode the T_V_ or the D_V_D_ or something else is in .\nuser interface: Right .\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Okay Because I've seen {disfmarker} mostly the standard ones ,\nuser interface: Especially you might need something like that for training the speech recognition and\nmarketing: yeah . Now you have it {disfmarker} now you have one with the very simple also . The idea is simple , but with a display , so you can see what you're doing .\nuser interface: Mm-hmm .\nmarketing: So maybe if we can incorporate the easiness of use , trendy , fancy , feels good , {vocalsound} uh with a display , wood , designer wood , designer colours\nuser interface: Mm-hmm .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: You know , maybe what you could do is when somebody orders the device id you could send them like um {vocalsound} a uh {vocalsound} uh b some sort of a foam rubber um ball ,\nmarketing: , we might've {disfmarker}\nuser interface: {vocalsound} Oh yeah .\nindustrial designer: and then they would squeeze it , and it would take the shape of their hand .\nuser interface: Yeah , so it's really molded to to your specific {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} To t {vocalsound} an and then you would know like {vocalsound} um what the geometry of their hands would be and uh {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: {vocalsound} {vocalsound}\nmarketing: How hard they squeeze ?\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} Yes {vocalsound} you'd know what kind of wood to get .\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Resistance resistance , right . {vocalsound}\nuser interface: But th for that you'd also have to do sort of an average across families and things like that if {disfmarker} unless everyone has their own personal remote .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} That's right , that's right , you wouldn't wanna go too far down that . Oh that {disfmarker} that actually would uh increase the um {disfmarker} the revenues we could expect , yeah . {vocalsound}\nuser interface: The sales , yeah . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: The {disfmarker} Yeah . I hope so .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: No , but incorporating the three uh obviously it'd be something totally new on the market , totally different\nuser interface: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: and from {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Well , already the customisability is a really good sort of new gimmick .\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Although , what it {disfmarker} was it uh {disfmarker} it was uh Nokia that came out with this changeable colours .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm .\nmarketing: Right , you take it apart , and put on another face , take it off and put on another face\nuser interface: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} Right , mm .\nuser interface: And that took off , yeah , yeah .\nmarketing: and then they sold millions , millions . So . So say with the f with the findings , with the research , easy to use something totally new .\nuser interface: Mm-hmm .\nmarketing: We have to come up with something totally new that is not on the market ."}, {"chapter": 4, "start_ms": 1578000, "topic": "Labour force in terms of manufacture", "transcript_text": "industrial designer: We'd also have to wor um consider that uh who we were gonna get to make these custom cases in terms of manufacturing processes , we might wanna um learn about um {vocalsound} labour laws .\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: You know in different countries and stuff wher so we can do it cheap , but you don't wanna exploit uh labour in um third world countries .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: So actually you could turn it y turn around and say that you're uh par the reason the cost is high for the device is because um you're paying a a working wage to the person who made the device .\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: Yeah , but we can get a production in , uh {vocalsound} , countries like , uh , India\nindustrial designer: Cost of living is low .\nproject manager: {disfmarker} yes , yes , countries like India or China or Malaysia , so you can go a better features and better price and you can sell more .
