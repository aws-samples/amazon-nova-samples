My name is Freek Van Ponnen . I'm the Market Expert . But you already knew that . Um I've done some research . We have we uh have been doing research in a usability lab where we observed um users operating remote controls . Uh we let them fill out a questionnaire . We had one hundred of these uh test subjects . Uh in addition we did some market research . Uh see what the market consists of . What ages are involved . Well these are three quite astonishing results , I thought . Um remotes are being considered ugly . F uh seventy five percent of the um people questioned uh indicated that they thought their remote were was ugly . Um and an additional eighty percent indicated that they would spend more money on a fancy-looking remote control . So {disfmarker} Um in addition remotes were not very functional . Fifty percent of the people indicated they only loo used about ten percent of the buttons on a remote control . And fifty percent of the people indicated that their remote tended to get lost in their room . So\nuser interface: Mm .\nmarketing: some things . Then we did some research to the most relevant functions . Channel selection and volume selection um both got a ten on a scale of one to ten for relevancy . The power button got a nine . And teletext got a six and a half . So these are the most most uh important functions on a remote control . Then there are some one-time use function . That's what I like to call them . That uh audio settings , video settings , and channel settings buttons . Which are not really used very frequently , but are still considered to be of some importance . Um channel selection was also indicated to be used very frequently . One hundred and sixty eight times per hour . Then these are the {disfmarker} This is the market . Um sixty percent of the market consists of users between the ages sixteen and forty f six . Um {disfmarker} Main characteristic of this group is that they're very critical on the remote control . Um they like to use new f new functions . But they also are very critical . They won't spend their money very easily . So {disfmarker} Um the users of forty six to sixty five years cons The make up forty percent of the market . They are not really very interested in features . But they do tend to spend their money a lot easier . What I think this indicates for our um design . I think we should make a remote for the future . And this means we would um have to focus on the age ages sixteen to forty five . Uh this also makes up most the biggest part of the market , so that will also be where our main profit would be gettable . Um this would mean we would have to make a fancy design . Um {disfmarker} The results also indicated that um about one quarter of the people questioned thought that the remote control caused R_S_ R_S_I_ . Um this is certainly something to take into account . And thirty four percent thought that it was hard to learn a n how to operate a new control , remote control . So these are two factors that I think should be included in the design . Besides of course that the remote must look very nice . And the functionality {disfmarker} As a lot of people indicated , they only use about ten percent of the buttons , I think we should make very few buttons . Uh this will also be uh beneficial to the design of the remote . Uh I think the most frequently used buttons should be emphasised . Especially the channel selection and audio uh selection buttons . 'Cause they're used most and so they should be robust . They shouldn't break down easily . Um {disfmarker} Then as mo as a lot of people indicated that their um remote got lost in the room , it might be and I say might be because it would um certainly boost the uh production costs a lot . But it might be a good idea to make a docking station . And this would , could get a button in it which would send a signal to the remote which would then beep . So you'd know where it is in the room . And in addition to this it could um recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in . Then um a surprisingly great deal of people w indicated that um an L_C_D_ screen in the remote control would be preferred . This was um mostly people in the age of sixteen to twenty five . But up till forty five it remains feasible . This would also greatly increase the production costs but I think these are just some small factors we could consider .\nproject manager: Okay .\nmarketing: That would be all .\nproject manager: Thank you . So anybody have um any questions until now ?\nmarketing: Any questions ?\nproject manager: About functional requirements ?\nuser interface: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: Okay\nindustrial designer: No .\nproject manager: that's clear . {gap} Now to the second .\nmarketing: 'Kay . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}"}, {"chapter": 2, "start_ms": 204000, "topic": "User Interface's presentation about technical function design followed by a brief discussion", "transcript_text": "user interface: Uh okay .

Uh uh I've do I've uh done a little uh research on the internet and {gap} not much information about it , {gap} {disfmarker} Um about uh interface but uh {disfmarker} Uh {disfmarker} Yeah I I've been thinking about a simple manner uh to put a lot of functions uh uh in one um in one uh remote control . Uh so uh you've got a lot of devi uh devices like uh D_V_D_ uh uh television , uh stereo . So um {disfmarker} But uh it must be uh user-friendly .

Um uh people uh don't like it , uh so um {disfmarker} Well what uh I was uh thinking about was um uh keep the general functions uh like they are . So uh like uh the on-off uh button . Uh keep it uh yeah l like a red button . Uh everybody everybody knows it so uh uh you don't have to change that . Um {disfmarker} My personal uh preferences um . Use a display for uh specific uh functions of the different uh device .

So um this button is for a D_V_D_ or {vocalsound} {disfmarker} So um for every um device you've got a uh a f a b a part uh display of a part buttons . So uh you you never got uh all the buttons uh on w one device .\nproject manager: Hmm . {vocalsound}\nuser interface: So uh that's uh my uh idea about it .\nproject manager: 'Kay .\nuser interface: Um yeah and {disfmarker} Uh let's see .

Okay .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: I think it's going to {disfmarker} Uh it's not too much . Okay . {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Okay I've got a presentation about the working design . Um first about how it works . It's really simple of course . Everybody knows how a remote works . The user presses a button . The remote determines what button it is , uses the infrared to send a signal to the T_V_ . The T_V_ switches to the frequency , or what function it is . So we've got um the the plate . It gots conductive disks for every button . When the user presses a button , a signal got sent , goes to the LED and transmits tranmi transmits its to the T_V_ . It's a very simple device , technically speaking . So this is a schematic overview . You've got the buttons . The power source . And uh when a button gets pressed , its goes to the chip . The chip uh controls the infrared bulb and perf perhaps a normal bulb . When you press a button you can actually see your pressed button . Well um I think we should use default materials , simple plastics . Keep the inner workings simple , so it's robust . Uh I think we should focus on aesthetics , the design and the user interface , because if you're going to use high-tech materials the price is going to go sky-high . And uh you only have to design a remote once , and if you use high-tech materials it come back in every product . So it's , in my idea , it's uh it's gonna be smart to invest in di in design and not in uh in the product itself . That's it .\nproject manager: Okay . Thank you . Okay .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}"}, {"chapter": 4, "start_ms": 594000, "topic": "Project Manager's amendments to project requirements and discussion focused on design", "transcript_text": "project manager: Uh {disfmarker} Okay now I hope everybody has a little bit more insight in the functions we all have and what we are doing right now . Um I'm the Project Manager so I'm here to mess things up and uh tell you some new uh requirements .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Um that's , we've uh got to design a um remote which is only suitable for T_V_ . Um that's because {vocalsound} uh it will be too complex\nuser interface: Okay .\nproject manager: and the time to market will be too big , if we wanna have it uh for more functions . So it has to be simple .\nuser interface: Mm .\nproject manager: Uh another point is we have to skip the teletext , because in the world of uh upcoming internet uh we think teletext is going to be uh a thing of the past . And uh it's a function we don't need in our remote control .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Um internet is also mentioned {gap} in a function we can use . Uh maybe also on televisions it will be available as well . Another one is uh the customer is uh forty plus . Uh that's the the market we have to to to target , because we are going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers . Um this is uh a bit pity for the Marketing uh Expert .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Because he was uh aiming on the the younger persons . So we have to find a market which is above forty plus uh but which will suit our uh remote control , and the other way round . And we have to be very uh attent in uh putting the corporate image uh in our product . So it has to be visible in our design , in the way our device works . And uh we have to be uh very clear on this point as well . So I suggest let's have a discussion on the control functions . Yeah .\nmarketing: So is there any discussion possible about the new product requirement ?\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Uh we can see if we can find a way uh between the functions we wanna use and the market we wanna reach with our product . Um {disfmarker}\nuser interface: {vocalsound} Mm .\nmarketing: Yeah 'cause you're you're saying that teletext is gonna be an old feature and it's not gonna be used anymore anyway pretty soon . And new T_V_s will have internet access on them .\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: But I think if you're targeting people of forty plus , the chance that they will have a T_V_ with internet access within the next like twenty years is very slim .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nmarketing: In addition people indicated that teletext simply was an important feature for the remote control . So I think it's pretty dumb to put no teletext feature on it . I'm pretty much against it .\nproject manager: Against the no teletext ?\nuser interface: Mm .\nmarketing: Yes . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Um {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Besides that , I think the market for forty plus is like pretty small . But I mean if I s if I see this , it's {disfmarker} I think we're just gonna go for another\nproject manager: Yeah it's it is {disfmarker}\nuser interface: {gap} forty {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Standard remote .\nmarketing: pretty\nproject manager: No I think we can\nmarketing: and not innovative\nproject manager: I think we can do a lot with the design and the simple buttons\nmarketing: remote control .\nproject manager: which were also mentioned . Uh if we put a lot of effort in those , we can make a remote control with uh just two or three buttons . Or just a remote which is suitable for the market we wanna reach because it is forty percent of the market .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nproject manager: And um if you look in Holland at the whole generation of forty plus , fifty plus , it it's the the biggest share of the of the whole population now .\nmarketing: Yes but it's not the biggest part of the market .\nproject manager: No .\nmarketing: And besides that , they're not very critical so {disfmarker} I mean they don't really care what the remote control is like . They'll just pretty much take the first thing they see and which looks acceptable .\nproject manager: But don't you think that if we make a remote which is uh typically made for this market , that people think {gap} {disfmarker} the people think that's the the device I've looked for although I didn't realise it .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So let's try it .\nmarketing: No . I think that would be the case in the sixteen to forty five age category . because they are critical and they they want to have a fancy remote control .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nmarketing: People of forty plus , I mean they want it to work , but as soo as soon as it works it's okay with them .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nuser interface: Mm .\nindustrial designer: I think that if we're {disfmarker} If we put our marketing right um we can sell this just like um {disfmarker} I don't know if you've heard about it in the news , the the elderly mobile phone ?\nmarketing: So {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Yeah . It's a big success .\nindustrial designer: Yeah if we if we make a remote control just l with that idea in mind , we could make tons of money , I think .\nproject manager: Very big success .\nmarketing: I haven't heard of it .\nproject manager: Yeah . Uh . I think so as well .\nuser interface: Mm .\nmarketing: Hmm .\nindustrial designer: We don't have to focus on on on the on the design then but on functionality . We just change our focus on the project , and I think we can uh we can sell this .\nproject manager: Uh I simply think um\nuser interface: {gap}"}, {"chapter": 5, "start_ms": 960000, "topic": "Group discussion about functionality with the elderly as target customers", "transcript_text": "project manager: uh that the new products we are gonna make , uh spef specifically design , are designed for uh younger people , uh so maybe we can focus ourself on the elderly people . And I think we have to um see what requirements we need for those um remote controls . {vocalsound} 'Cause what you told is the channel selection is important . Volume selection , power and teletext . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Yes .\nuser interface: Mm .\nproject manager: Okay . Um {disfmarker}\nuser interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nmarketing: Yes . But obviously the board tends to disagree .\nproject manager: No we we haven't voted yet , so {disfmarker} {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Uh I think teletext can be uh um can be a function as well . But only if uh if it won't higher the the cost , because I don't know if it will be a lot more money to implement teletext as well , but I don't think it will be a problem . Or is teletext a {disfmarker}\nuser interface: But um deaf people need uh teletext for uh for subtitles .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nuser interface: So it's {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Yeah , also .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nproject manager: Yeah . So I suggest uh {disfmarker}\nmarketing: I think it'd definitely be a bad idea not to include teletext .\nuser interface: It's {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Yeah .\nuser interface: Mm .\nproject manager: Is anybody um really against teletext ?\nindustrial designer: No .\nproject manager: No ? Just that , that we just keep the teletext . I think that's a good idea as well , especially for the subtitles . Maybe we can make that um another point of advantage in our remote control , if we uh make a k a button ex for example for big subtitles , which is instantly on the remote control . For elderly people they can think , oh I wanna have subtitles ,\nuser interface: Yeah yeah .\nproject manager: and they push the button and they get the big subtitles .\nuser interface: Yeah . Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Uh that's a good idea .\nproject manager: Um so I think teletext can v can be very useful in our advantage . Um {disfmarker} Functionality should be few buttons , you said .\nmarketing: Yes .\nproject manager: I think uh that's very important we have a few buttons .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: So to keep it simple .\nmarketing: But I don't think that's really an issue any more 'cause {disfmarker} Well might be .\nuser interface: If it's only for televi\nmarketing: But I mean it , if it's only for T_V_ you're not gonna need a lot of buttons anyway .\nuser interface: Yeah . Yeah .\nproject manager: No .\nmarketing: You need a one to zero button , next channel , previous channel ,\nuser interface: Yeah .\nmarketing: volume up , volume down , and some teletext buttons but {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Yeah . But do you need {disfmarker}\nuser interface: So we can s we can skip the display ,\nmarketing: I think if you if you only l\nuser interface: so uh we don't need it .\nproject manager: But do you need the buttons for one to zero .\nmarketing: Nah .\nproject manager: Maybe c we can {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Uh {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Think if you're gonna include teletext you do . I think many people like to use that .\nproject manager: Maybe we can use uh {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Yeah .\nmarketing: 'Cause if you should , if you want to switch from channel one to like thirty five , you don't wanna push the next channel button thirty five times .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nproject manager: No , maybe we can implement the scroll button ? Or a joystick like ?\nuser interface: Mm .\nproject manager: There are other ways too . Just look if you look at telephones . The Sony telephone has a scroll button which is very useful in searching names or {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Yeah . Mm-hmm . Yeah .\nmarketing: That's true but um I don't think there are many T_V_s that can switch channels that fast . And so you would need like the T_V_ would need an a function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it . And I dunno if many channels would do have that . If many T_V_s have that .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nuser interface: Mm .\nindustrial designer: And besides that it's um {disfmarker} If we're gonna focus on elderly people they'll have to adapt . They're not used to using scroll buttons .\nproject manager: That's right .\nindustrial designer: So perhaps we should s stick to the basic layout .\nuser interface: Mm .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: {gap} the numbers yeah . Yeah they can see how much buttons there are going to be on on the display , and if it's too much we can uh reconsider it . But I think there won't be very much buttons .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nproject manager: Or there don't have to be a lot .\nmarketing: But I don't think {disfmarker} I think if you're gonna make a remote control only to operate a T_V_ , you there's not much you can gain on um having as few buttons as possible . 'Cause I think there are pretty many remote controls that can only operate a T_V_ , which already only have the minimum number of buttons . I don't think there's much to be gained in that area .\nproject manager: The number of buttons ?\nuser interface: Hmm .\nproject manager: I think it's very important in the in the design .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: You can make a very fancy design uh with putting the buttons on the right places . And if you have less buttons you can do a lot more with {disfmarker}\nmarketing: That is true but I think there's simply not much to gain on the competition when you when you're making a remote control only for to operate only the T_V_ .\nproject manager: To operate only the T_V_ yeah .\nmarketing: 'Cause if you have a a remote control only to operate a T_V_ there's simply not a lot of buttons required . There's not a lot of functions required so most existing remote controls simply don't have a lot of buttons either .\nproject manager: No .\nuser interface: No .\nproject manager: So .\nmarketing: So I think it would be very hard to actually gain on the competition here .\nproject manager: 'Kay . So we can {disfmarker}\nmarketing: That would that would cost a a big marketing expedition\nproject manager: Yeah . That's right .\nmarketing: which was one of the arguments to make it only for the T_V_ because we didn't have the time to market a lot .\nproject manager: Yeah . So you suggest we could better um focus on for example the docking station .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Uh uh like other functions . Instead of f of less buttons .\nmarketing: Maybe . Well yeah I think , mean we obviously need a good way to position all the buttons and {disfmarker} But I don't think we should spend very much time in that .\nproject manager: Mm . No . Do you think the docking station will uh is allowed in the budget we have ?\nindustrial designer: It should be possible yes . If it's not too fancy .\nproject manager: 'Cause it can be {disfmarker}\nuser interface: No .\nproject manager: No .\nindustrial designer: And if the remote stays rather small , it should be possible\nproject manager: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: yeah .\nuser interface: No .\nproject manager: Because I think that's uh {disfmarker} That's a good advantage point as well . If we have a fancy-looking docking station\nindustrial designer: Yes .\nproject manager: or very {disfmarker} {gap}\nuser interface: Hmm .\nproject manager: That's a nice requirement . Docking station .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: So we're just gonna focus on the extras ?\nproject manager: I think so .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nuser interface: Mm .\nmarketing: Yeah I think maybe we should do some research into what elderly people like to have in a\nproject manager: Yeah .\nmarketing: like to have extra in a new remote control .\nproject manager: That's a good point . Um {disfmarker} You said they easily get lost as well .\nmarketing: Yes well fifty percent of the people indicated that remote control tended to get lost .\nproject manager: Yeah . So maybe we should implement the audio sign , or something .\nmarketing: Yeah that was what I suggested .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Like with your key-chain , if you whistle it goes uh it makes a sound .\nmarketing: You have it on {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Yeah .\nmarketing: Yeah\nuser interface: Hm .\nmarketing: you have it's on some phones too , which have a docking station .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nmarketing: And you just press a button and the phone goes ringing .\nproject manager: Yeah . So\nmarketing: So you know where it is .\nproject manager: audio signal should be possible as well . I think it's not too expensive .\nuser interface: No .\nproject manager: {gap} Uh another point is the L_C_D_ screen . Um I don't know if that will rise the cost too much , because {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: Y i um I think we'll have to choose between the docking station or the screen , 'cause\nproject manager: Yeah . It will be too much as well .\nuser interface: Mm .\nindustrial designer: it's uh {disfmarker} {gap}\nmarketing: I think since a lot of people indicated that a new remote control is hard to learn , and we're focusing on elderly people here which tend to have a hard time understanding new devices , it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it , which would explain a button if you press it . Which would tell you what it does .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nmarketing: And it wouldn't have to be touchscreen or a very expensive screen ,\nproject manager: Based .\nuser interface: Okay . Yeah .\nmarketing: but {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Just the L_C_D_ . Oh just the normal screen .\nmarketing: Just a small screen\nproject manager: That's a good idea . So {disfmarker}\nmarketing: with two {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Some extra info . Feedback .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: Yeah . I think that's a good idea as well .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nmarketing: But I dunno if that would\nproject manager: As the small screen .\nmarketing: that would fit into the costs .\nproject manager: Extra button info . I think that should be possible as well . Um {vocalsound} let's see what did we say . Mm . More . Should be fancy to , fancy design , easy to learn . Few buttons , we talked about that . Docking station , L_C_D_ . Um general functions {disfmarker} Yeah . 'Kay . And default materials . I think that's a good idea as well , because um elderly people don't mind if it's a titanium cover or just a plastic one .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: So that doesn't really matter .\nuser interface: Mm .\nmarketing: No .\nproject manager: So I think we nee\nmarketing: I think probably elderly people would be a little bit more careful with their remote controls than youngsters .\nproject manager: Uh let's um specify the target group . Because are we talking about elderly elderly people or people from forty to eighty . Because I think what we're going to design now is for people above sixty , maybe .\nuser interface: Mm . Yeah .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: Uh what do we want ? If we want um a {gap} with uh for example the the telephone for elderly people , we can\nmarketing: I think {disfmarker}\nproject manager: target the real elderly people .\nmarketing: I think that would be a {disfmarker} If we should do something like that it would be a , I think it would be really good for uh for the image of the company .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nmarketing: And I think , I think there would be a good market for it .\nproject manager: So that's the {disfmarker}\nmarketing: If we're able to really bring an innovative product .\nproject manager: {gap} Now you're talking about sixty to eighty for example .\nmarketing: Yeah the really {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Yeah .\nuser interface: Mm .\nproject manager: Sixty .\nmarketing: But I'd have to look into that a little more .\nproject manager: Okay . And different cultures . Are we {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: Well I don't think they have different television sets uh\nproject manager: Okay .\nuser interface: Mm .\nindustrial designer: in uh every country .\nproject manager: No .\nuser interface: No .\nindustrial designer: 'Cause {disfmarker}\nproject manager: We've got five minutes left {vocalsound} just now .\nuser interface: So 'Kay .\nproject manager: Small warning .\nmarketing: 'Kay . And with uh the little screen in it , {gap} which explains the buttons . You could {disfmarker} I think we n it would be a lot easier to\nproject manager: Should {disfmarker}\nmarketing: adapt it to different cultures .\nproject manager: Yeah . In different languages , you know . Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nproject manager: or you have to put a language button in it ,\nuser interface: Right .\nproject manager: but that will be a bit unnecessary I think .\nuser interface: No . Yeah .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nproject manager: It's better to put it on different markets with it all .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nproject manager: Okay . So\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nproject manager: that's the the target . Uh then a few small things .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}"}]}
