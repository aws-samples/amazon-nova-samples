So for energy sources we have we have to choose between the solar energy , hand dynamo and uh kinetic um well uh kinetic uh technique {vocalsound} to to store the energy .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: We also um {vocalsound} we also can put a regular battery in the in the remote control . Now {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Uh this is what we have decided in the last meeting . But if we use battery {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: Yeah b uh f well uh I meant uh by by battery I meant uh I will not have a uh a wire between the remote control and the energy source but uh I didn't fou we didn't decide yet which kind of battery we will put inside the the remote . So uh it's a point to discuss . Then uh the case material we have uh uh also several choices , like wood , rubber , titanium or latex . {vocalsound} But uh well it's not a a re uh well a real issue for the {vocalsound} {disfmarker} from the technical uh point of view . Concerning the interface uh we can we can put mm just simple buttons or scrolls or buttons uh much more complicated , but it also requires that the chip to process the button is more complicated so .\nuser interface: Mm .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} And uh this is the last point , the choice of chips . So what I have f found is that I think basic battery or kinetic uh energy uh collection is the is the better way to provide energy because I think solar energy wi won't work {vocalsound} in a cluttered uh {vocalsound} uh environment .\nuser interface: Mm .\nindustrial designer: So um so I think we can start with these two main things . For the case uh well uh I think that uh titanium is um is a good choice because it's trendy and it's uh it's uh well it's modern and uh user are are are {disfmarker} mm will be uh very happy to have a {vocalsound} a a nice remote . For the interface uh I think that we can ach achieve uh all the desired functionalities by s just uh using uh rubber buttons , simple buttons and th thus this allow to use a regular chip {vocalsound} that are uh well cheaper . {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Mm .\nindustrial designer: And s so uh we can move to the next slide .\nuser interface: Sorry .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nuser interface: What is this single curved {disfmarker} what does it mean ?\nindustrial designer: Well uh uh i i it's uh it's the the shape of the um of the remote .\nuser interface: So it's it's not {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: You you will have the {disfmarker} well um the the curve will fit into your hand when you grab the {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Yo l yeah . When you hold on it , it is comfortable to hold .\nindustrial designer: Yeah . It's more confog f comfortable that if these uh it's completely flat .\nuser interface: Okay . Yeah . And the battery , is it kind of a rechargeable or it doesn't matter ?\nindustrial designer: Yeah the um that's the point . The kinetic one is uh y you can recharge uh by the um {disfmarker}\nuser interface: That that's what it means by kinetic .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah and by {disfmarker} well by just by moving the ar uh your arm the mm well the remote will uh accumulate energy .\nuser interface: Okay . Mm-hmm . Okay .\nindustrial designer: But I d I don't know it's {disfmarker} if it is feasible because I don't know if yet if if the user will move enough to provide the remote um all the necessary energy .\nuser interface: Mm . {vocalsound} Mm . Okay . Yeah . Yeah . We we might check with our R_ and D_ department to see if they have this product {vocalsound} ready for market . {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah . {vocalsound} And {disfmarker} yeah and so can you go to the next slide please . So and uh that's uh that summarize well what I have said .\nuser interface: Mm mm . {vocalsound} {vocalsound} Wha\nindustrial designer: So uh you're right we can uh see in our uh R_ and D_ uh {vocalsound} if the kinetic metal is sufficient to provide enough energy .\nuser interface: Ah the department . Mm .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} That's it .\nuser interface: Uh {disfmarker} So I um keep in touch with the R_ and D_ department .\nindustrial designer: Oh yeah\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: I take care , it's all right .\nuser interface: {vocalsound} So the titanium case is the normal case that {disfmarker} I'll show you some pictures that I have and you tell me whether they are titanium case or not .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} All right . Yeah .\nuser interface: 'Cause I am not very sure , plastic , titanium or whatever . There's another point I want to make , is that the uh {disfmarker} well you've seen them I le na my presentation that um I point out some {disfmarker} why buttons are not the mm not the only ways you can {vocalsound} use {disfmarker} Yeah . Yeah , maybe n\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: We will , okay .\nuser interface: {vocalsound}"}, {"chapter": 2, "start_ms": 294000, "topic": "Presentation about system design of user interface", "transcript_text": "project manager: Three .\nuser interface: Yeah . {vocalsound} So the user interface is uh i it uses the aspect uh of a computer system , a programme which can be seen or heard or otherwise perceived by the human user\nproject manager: {gap}\nuser interface: and the commands and mechanism the user uses to control its operation and input data . So you s this gives you the ways to input data and we have uh {disfmarker} we are more {disfmarker} we emphasise more on the graphical user interface here . The idea is to represent buttons as figures , diagrams , symbols and on so you you can easily when you look at the symbols you understand what it is doing .\nproject manager: What's the function of this button .\nuser interface: Yeah . Yeah . So .\nproject manager: I think it makes the the interface really {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Ea easy to use . So next one .\nproject manager: Graphical user interface {gap} .\nuser interface: {gap} function five . So I can use the button , the mouse maybe .\nproject manager: A graphical user interface emphasise the use of pictures .\nuser interface: Yeah . So next line . So the {disfmarker} here are some examples . So they cluster the buttons together . They group them into col they colour them and uh they have different forms as well . Mm but this interface are kind of confusing . Uh basically there are too many buttons . Right . Next one .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nuser interface: So some people are propose voice recognition and so {disfmarker} ah by the way I receive an email from the from one our departments saying that the voice recognition has been used in the coffee machine {vocalsound} for this by a company\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: when you tell the {disfmarker} you say good morning coffee machine and the machine are reply to you . So I just got an email saying that .\nindustrial designer: Mm-hmm mm mm .\nuser interface: And it seems like this voice recognition technology is ready to be used so we might consider that , supposedly .\nindustrial designer: Yeah fine .\nuser interface: {vocalsound} The next one . Mm so somebody {disfmarker} some people use uh some people use a spinning wheel th with the L_C_ display so instead of using the mm buttons you have a L_C_D_ screen and then there you can u you can use that as buttons , you can use that as real {disfmarker} so so that could be an option as well . Touch screen , I mean .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nuser interface: Next one . And some people propose a scroll button . Integrated with push buttons or you may have scroll button instead of p just the push button . Like the one we have here . Uh , next one . So mm\nproject manager: Mm-hmm .\nuser interface: so there are a few aspects that I collected here . So s basically this deals with special users , children , handicapped people , old people , and uh mm and prog basically they are programmable , specially for children . And uh mm {disfmarker} yeah yeah . And then they also secure uh covers , to protect uh secure and hidden programming and battery covers that will protect your settings . So {disfmarker} But we don't have to integrate all these complicated features . I'm just saying that the {disfmarker} currently in the market there are there are control there are remote controllers f {gap} customisable for different people . Yeah , so that's the point . The next one . And uh you see this is the one where you have the protection cover . Mm maybe useful for children , they migh you you they only see the buttons outside . And for adults wh where you have more control you can see the one inside . So the adults might wanna have a key to lock that to pr so children will not touch the button inside .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: S a good idea .\nuser interface: The next one .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: So this guy {disfmarker} this is another company that provides big buttons . At {disfmarker} I see that that is useful for old people and then you don't get it lost . But for our product we don't need a big one because you have voice recognition e eventually with use .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nuser interface: And you can call your remote controller if you don't know where it is .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound} T_V_ remote controller where are you ?\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: And then , he will beeps and to say that I am here , {vocalsound} for example .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {gap} We should include speech synthesis in this case , no ?\nuser interface: Is it possible ?\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nuser interface: Uh ? {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Yeah but uh as Norman say if uh there is uh already a commercial product available who t who do this we we can check uh to integrate it i into our uh new remote control .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nuser interface: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . And uh , this is another one where you can uh {disfmarker} the the the part that's a V_ standing for the volume . So there's a up arrow and a down arrow . But you the see that in the V_ , the V_ appears to be the down arrow on the top {disfmarker} on the top up arrow {disfmarker} {vocalsound} if you {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Mm-hmm .\nuser interface: up arrow there's a V_ like as as if it's turning down so it's confusing interface , so I wanna avoid this kind of thing in the design .\nindustrial designer: Yeah yeah .\nuser interface: And here are {disfmarker} is uh here is a s short summary that I summary that I compiled after the findings I found . Big buttons are convenient , voice recognition helps , push buttons , scroll buttons , spinning wheels can be used as navigation tools . And uh user customisable is important and finally simplicity simplicity is the key . Yeah . So {vocalsound} we have many concepts there\nindustrial designer: Hmm . {vocalsound}\nuser interface: but we have to choose later on which ones are important to be used .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nuser interface: And basically uh {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: Well I {vocalsound} I think you it's it's it's fine you have uh reviewed all all the possibilities\nuser interface: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: but uh uh well uh i if we consider that uh the user interface is displayed on the T_V_ screen I don't think we nee uh we need much buttons in the remote\nproject manager: {gap}\nuser interface: Mm-hmm .\nindustrial designer: since we we just have to navigate and to have a okay or enter key or things like that ,\nuser interface: Yeah . Mm .\nindustrial designer: because uh adding wheels or scrolls uh makes the thing more complicated and more expensive also , so .\nuser interface: Mm . Okay .\nproject manager: Or maybe we can include the user manual in the in the remote control {gap} and we should have just a button like help and you say uh and you ik you press the button help and maybe you see the the user m might in the in the T_V_ .\nindustrial designer: Yeah . That's a good idea .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: To have a help button .\nuser interface: A help button .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nuser interface: So you are display on the screen .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nproject manager: On T_V_ T_V_ screen .\nuser interface: So {disfmarker} on the T_V_ screen .\nindustrial designer: On the T_V_ screen . On the T_V_ screen the uh how to use your remote .\nproject manager: So just you push the button\nuser interface: Okay . Okay . Okay .\nproject manager: and we will {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Oh .\nuser interface: So that eliminates all the complicated documentation {gap} ,\nproject manager: Yeah .\nuser interface: okay . So wi\nmarketing: But people are often enough looking at the help ,\nproject manager: If the if {disfmarker}\nmarketing: once they see the help button they say oh this is a complicated stuff .\nproject manager: {vocalsound} No {vocalsound} In the case where they need help , in the case where they need help .\nindustrial designer: Uh yeah . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound} It's a psychology .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} In a marketing point of view .\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Okay .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nmarketing: And let us see what the market demands .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nmarketing: We could just go to my presentation .\nindustrial designer: But {disfmarker} uh wel well I think {disfmarker}\nproject manager: It's just for user customizable , for kids or old people .\nmarketing: Yeah that's right .\nuser interface: Mm .\nproject manager: So {disfmarker}\nmarketing: I mean it just showed us the remote with an cap which could be used for kids and if you remove the {disfmarker}\nproject manager: So it's the same {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Same remote with some {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Can be used by both kids and old people .\nmarketing: Both yeah .\nuser interface: Mm . {vocalsound} Well uh what I s propose is that uh you know a remote controller , i {vocalsound} it could be a cube ,\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: is uh a small device that uh looks like a cube and maybe you can just change the {vocalsound} um the buttons , if you ch turn one side you get one one buttons , you turn the other side you get the other buttons , so for maybe new generation people who get used to the computer they want lots of controls . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: Maybe for kids , kids they like uh t no l they like to {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Small {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: Uh well .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: So le le let's see what uh what {vocalsound} people want .\nuser interface: Let's see the market demand .\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: And then we can decide what what we can {disfmarker} yeah .\nuser interface: What what {gap} market {disfmarker} yes yes .\nproject manager: {gap}"}, {"chapter": 3, "start_ms": 984000, "topic": "Discussion about specific details connected with market interests", "transcript_text": "marketing: So we just made an marketing survey of what people need from our remotes and how it could be special from the other remotes . And we got the best on the responses from the questionnaires . Uh we also have some prizes for the most creative solutions . And we found the following solutions which we could {disfmarker} which would be helpful for our design . So seventy percent of the users , they find their remote controls very ugly , they don't find it pleasant to use in the size or usage or anything . And eighty percent of the people they are always l I mean they are willing to spend more money if the remote control would look fancy . And the current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user . And seventy five percent of the users said they zap a lot .\nproject manager: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: And fifty percent say they use only ten percent of the buttons ,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nmarketing: so the rest of the ninety percent of the buttons they're not used most of the times .\nuser interface: Yeah . Yes .\nmarketing: So this were the findings which we found . And also they cited frustrations with the present remote controls . Most of {disfmarker} fifty percent of the time the remote controls are lost somewhere in the room and people are always searching for them {vocalsound} rather than watching the T_V_ .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nmarketing: And by the time they found the remote control the program is finished .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nmarketing: So {vocalsound} they're frustrated a lot {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: And um if the remote control is too complicated it takes much time to learn the functionality of it .\nuser interface: Mm .\nindustrial designer: Mm , the functionalities yeah .\nmarketing: So you can just see the percentage , fifty percent people they responded that they always lose their remotes and thirty four percent they say that it's quite difficult to learn if it's too complex .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nmarketing: So keeping in view all these findings and the frustrations I think this should be the solution for them . We should have an L_C_D_ on the rem remote control .\nuser interface: Oh .\nindustrial designer: Well mm w well I I I don't really see the advantage of having uh L_C_D_ on the on the remote control if we have a a a big screen and uh display on the screen .\nuser interface: Big screen .\nindustrial designer: It's {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Mm-hmm ?\nindustrial designer: yeah of course it's fancy trendy and so on but it's it's expensive to produce {vocalsound} and it's not really {disfmarker}\nmarketing: I mean as our survey says that people are willing to pay more if their remotes are fancy .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nmarketing: So if we have a L_C_D_ on the remote , rather than looking onto the T_V_ you just look into a remote and navigate it . It's the same menu as we have saw that iPod remote control .\nuser interface: Mm yeah .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah yeah .\nuser interface: Mm . The thing {vocalsound} {disfmarker}\nmarketing: We just {vocalsound} play around\nindustrial designer: Yeah but when you play with the iPod you don't have {vocalsound} a big screen in front of you , s\nproject manager: You can use this screen instead of the big se screen ,\nuser interface: Yeah . Yeah .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nproject manager: instead of use the {disfmarker} yeah .\nuser interface: If you re-use the existing screen , we element {disfmarker} eliminate the L_C_D_ , after all the L_C_D_ just to display\nproject manager: Hmm .\nuser interface: and if you have the colourful screen you can make the display colourful , fancy , as fancy as the one on the L_C_D_ ,\nmarketing: Yeah .\nuser interface: maybe even better .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nuser interface: So {disfmarker}\nmarketing: I mean this were the points which we got from the market demands .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Yeah . Yeah yeah .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nmarketing: So\nindustrial designer: So I th I I {vocalsound} well I think we we can focus on the uh on the fancy look on the uh\nuser interface: Yeah . More on a fancy design .\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah that's fine .\nindustrial designer: on the speech recognition if the technology is available\nmarketing: Yeah . I mean that's {disfmarker}\nuser interface: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nindustrial designer: but well I think L_C_D_ will uh will uh make us spend a lot of money for not so big results .\nuser interface: Mm . Remember we have a s budget for the cost of producing the remote controller .\nmarketing: Mm-hmm .\nproject manager: But {disfmarker} Yeah .\nuser interface: Yeah . So i is {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Uh yeah we have uh {disfmarker}\nproject manager: {gap}\nuser interface: so the thing is you can find out how much an L_C_D_ will cost and then we'll decide again . {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound} I mean that should be found out by the Industrial Designers . {vocalsound}\nproject manager: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Uh maybe you can find out the price and tell us next time {gap} . Is i if i\nindustrial designer: So price of uh L_C_D_ display .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: And {disfmarker}\nmarketing: And it's always good to have an voice recognition for the remote controls .\nuser interface: Yeah . And also the cost for the speech recognition .\nproject manager: Mm . It's for {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Ask our R_ and D_ department .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nproject manager: it's just for small vocabulary . We {disfmarker} it's not {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Yeah .\nmarketing: Yeah it's o only for a limited vocabulary ,\nproject manager: yeah .\nuser interface: Yeah . And ho\nmarketing: say eighty commands or so .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Yeah okay .\nuser interface: And also the scroller button , how much will it cost . {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: And {disfmarker} Well uh compared to the to s the simpl simpler simplest button .\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Yeah . Push push {gap} .\nmarketing: Mm , the scroll button , {gap} from the survey we never see that people would like to have some scrolling button .\nindustrial designer: Yeah . Yeah I think that {disfmarker}\nmarketing: Because they they just they're just frightened to use the scrollings or {vocalsound} help button .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Yeah I I I think that uh well uh as we have seen in the in the presentation uh well uh about uh uh fifty percent of the of the percent n choose the button\nuser interface: Don't use the buttons .\nindustrial designer: so uh I think to have uh five uh simple button is sufficient for our functionality .\nuser interface: Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .\nproject manager: It doesn't mean that the other buttons are not necessary or important .\nmarketing: Yeah . {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Important .\nindustrial designer: Yeah . But {disfmarker}\nproject manager: But they are just less used compar\nmarketing: They're not used much .\nproject manager: yeah .\nindustrial designer: But the uh the thing is is i is that we can add a functionality on the on the T_V_ screen\nuser interface: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: like uh a a list of function\nuser interface: Yeah . Mm .\nindustrial designer: and then you choose with the with the button to {disfmarker} well you navigate\nuser interface: Yeah , yeah . So so the at most {disfmarker} more power uh .\nindustrial designer: and you {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Or maybe we can u uh or maybe we can uh make this the ten percent of button more bigger than the others .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nproject manager: So .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: But if i i if we if we could have a a a display uh g a user interface that is very complete on the T_V_ screen {vocalsound} I think that just five buttons are sufficient ,\nuser interface: Yep .\nindustrial designer: one to go up left right down and uh enter\nuser interface: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: and you you you just select the functionality you want to access or things like that .\nuser interface: Mm . Mm . Yeah .\nindustrial designer: You don't have to to switch to a channel to another uh {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Mm .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nmarketing: Or it could be like this , as the people say , if they have a L_C_D_ on the remote not on the television . Because when you have the L_C_D_ onto the television screen you miss the picture in the background , we are most focused on the commands .\nindustrial designer: Yeah but {disfmarker}\nmarketing: So if you have then L_C_D_ in the remote , you just have a menu , and increasing and lower these signs here to change the programs and this menu when you press the menu , in the L_C_D_ displays as you go on pressing the menu it faster displays volume , then the program , then the brightness , contrast and all the stuff .\nuser interface: Mm .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} {gap} Yeah but if you look at the L_C_D_ you you don't look at the T_V_ screen\nmarketing: And accordingly you can just increase or decrease .\nproject manager: It's {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Mm . Mm .\nindustrial designer: so {vocalsound} i i it's not really worth to get {disfmarker} to have the image if you don't look at , so .\nuser interface: I if {disfmarker} Mm . Mm .\nproject manager: And I think it's increases the cost of the the remote control if you use L_C_D_ . I {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nmarketing: Yeah that has to be checked out .\nuser interface: I think that there's no contradiction here , because if there are few buttons , you don't have to look at your your controller any more because you know where the buttons are , so if you wanna control the screen d sh sharpness you just say sharpness\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nuser interface: and then you t turn {disfmarker} you just press lef increase or decrease button\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: and the same for the volume and the channel , {vocalsound}\nmarketing: Yeah .\nuser interface: if you had the speech recognition there you just shout your channel , just tell your channel and then you don't even have to look at the butto at the controller so finally that wil eliminates the the need for L_C_D_ ,\nmarketing: Okay .\nuser interface: with the help of speech recogniser you can {disfmarker}\nmarketing: I mean , {gap} better if we could just check all the cost with L_C_D_\nuser interface: Yeah .\nmarketing: and also with the speech recognition .\nuser interface: Mm .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nmarketing: And then we could find which would would be a more suitable in this case .\nuser interface: Mm . Mm . {vocalsound} Yeah . A and {disfmarker}\nmarketing: And the third problem was to find the remote control . Always , so fifty percent of the people say they lose the remotes .\nindustrial designer: Well so we we can think about a well a a vocal command like uh find\nuser interface: Mm .\nindustrial designer: and {vocalsound} when the remote control uh hears fine well yeah just uh to make him beep or t\nproject manager: You will listen to a peep , {vocalsound} special peep .\nuser interface: Where {gap} , yeah .\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Yeah that's right , that's exactly what I mean by voice commander .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nmarketing: Or it could be also something like this ,\nuser interface: Yeah .\nmarketing: uh it's always boring to change the batteries of the remotes control ,\nuser interface: Mm .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nmarketing: so we have some one charger there and whenever we don't use the remote control we put it in the charger .\nuser interface: Put it back at the charge .\nindustrial designer: Put {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Yeah .\nmarketing: And when we're using that t remote and if we misplace somewhere , in the charger we have a small button , and just by pressing the button in the charger the uh remote control beeps , wherever it is .\nproject manager: Okay .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Yeah . And that's a good idea , that's simple , like in phones .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nuser interface: Mm .\nmarketing: I mean it doe it also doesn't require a voice command ,\nproject manager: But you don't you don't have to move the the charger .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nmarketing: because there are problems with a voice command .\nuser interface: Hmm . Mm . {vocalsound} Th yeah . Mm yeah . Yeah . Mm .\nmarketing: Yeah , yeah , yeah .\nproject manager: You have to keep it {gap} .\nmarketing: I mean charger would be fixed\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nmarketing: because it's always with electricity plugged .\nindustrial designer: Yeah if there if there uh there is nuff not enough battery . Also and uh uh the remote is lost .\nproject manager: Okay .\nuser interface: Mm . There's {disfmarker} mm . Mm .\nmarketing: {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah .\nmarketing: Yeah that's right .\nuser interface: That {disfmarker} we can {disfmarker} what we can do is we can program a function whereby when you press the switch off T_V_ button , the off button , the remote there be s uh instruction on the screen , please charge charge me . You never get it lost\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nuser interface: because uh every time you're off the computer {vocalsound} {disfmarker} the T_V_ you are asked the the command the T_V_ com remote controller would tell you to put it back to where {disfmarker} to the charger .\nmarketing: It's an good reminder ,\nuser interface: Yeah . So you will never get lost {gap} {disfmarker} yeah .\nmarketing: yeah that's right .\nindustrial designer: Okay .\nproject manager: Maybe for some people {gap} {vocalsound} lazy people .\nuser interface: Yeah . Yeah because everything is programmed inside .\nproject manager: Yeah yeah .\nuser interface: So it's it's uh it's all about strategy , y\nmarketing: And of course the final point is a fancy look .\nuser interface: Mm .\nmarketing: As we have seen earlier the remotes which were displayed by Norman they weren't fancy ,\nuser interface: Mm .\nindustrial designer: They were ugly .\nuser interface: {vocalsound} Yeah , yeah .\nmarketing: I mean mm very big or something with lot of buttons .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} They {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Mm .\nmarketing: I think we should have something {disfmarker} it {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: Well the last one with the um {vocalsound} yeah with the two parts was uh {gap} original , so {disfmarker}\nuser interface: With uh two two two parts controller .\nmarketing: I mean {gap} uh I mean uh I mean uh you see if it's like that even a kid who wants to have a control he could just plug it and {vocalsound} use it , you can't avoid him .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nmarketing: But you can have an button for child lock .\nuser interface: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nuser interface: Mm .\nmarketing: So just by pressing the button with some code , you t you put a lock onto the remote , so that he can't use even {gap} {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Mm . Mm . Mm . Mm .\nindustrial designer: Well we can think about uh having uh on the on the on the user interface when you switch on the T_V_ you can uh well write a code or choose a category , if it is kids , uh things like that .\nmarketing: Mm uh {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Mm .\nproject manager: Or {disfmarker}\nuser interface: Mm . Yeah . Mm .\nmarketing: That's right .\nproject manager: Or maybe you have to to show some specific programmes for kids and then just just {disfmarker} yeah just push uh kids button so it's automatically\nuser interface: Mm . {gap} these are probl yeah . Mm . Mm . Mm .\nproject manager: {gap} . So if he {gap} .\nmarketing: I think these other four points they're the market demands and so it's for the user interface design and industrial design to just think {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: So for mm {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Yeah .\nuser interface: Mm .\nindustrial designer: yeah . So for my part I will check the prices the um the prices difference uh of what to use , where to use , and s uh and so on .\nmarketing: Yeah I think it should be clearer for us in the next meeting that th uh these {gap} could be included .\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nuser interface: Mm . {vocalsound} I think we need to define also a s the set of vocabularies for the speech recogniser\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nuser interface: because uh if you want {gap} uh say we can sort by channels or sort by T_V_ programs , you have to decide a category of vocabularies for them . If numbers , they're easy ,\nproject manager: Mm-hmm .\nuser interface: but if {gap} name the channel by by name {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: Well I think we can we can have just numbers for channels and you can say to your remote control like uh sports and then on the T_V_ you have a list with with uh uh well with sports program playing now\nuser interface: Mm .\nindustrial designer: and and uh {disfmarker}\nmarketing: No , we have a problem there . You see uh if you have a voice commands and you are s you are watching a score on uh {disfmarker} basketball score or something , and if the score comes twenty four thirty five , you've just say twenty five\nproject manager: Yeah it's {disfmarker} yeah .\nmarketing: and suddenly {vocalsound} the screen the channel goes to twenty five .\nuser interface: Mm .\nindustrial designer: That's right , yeah , yeah .\nmarketing: So I think there should be a prefix to some numbers {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: Well but well e every possible word uh has a probability to come about of the T_V_ so . {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah .\nmarketing: I mean the the {disfmarker} you just check all the probability that saying T_V_ twenty five and just ordinary twenty five .\nuser interface: Mm .\nindustrial designer: Yeah yeah .\nmarketing: Ordinary twenty five you almost there's a probability of being said around sixty seventy percent\nuser interface: Mm .\nindustrial designer: Yeah but well {disfmarker} okay .\nmarketing: and T_V_ twenty five I dunno it will be round about one or two percent .\nuser interface: Mm .\nproject manager: Mm-hmm .\nuser interface: Mm .\nmarketing: So it's better to have some prefix {gap} before the number .\nuser interface: But I I I think that the user would like wou would like to associate the channel or call the channel rather than than the numbers .\nmarketing: Yeah something , some code .\nuser interface: You say numbe channel number five of the T_V_ correspond to something else in the channel .\nindustrial designer: Yeah yeah .\nuser interface: So some people may want to say , I want to see this channel .\nindustrial designer: Mm mm . Well I {disfmarker}\nmarketing: That will be too big .\nproject manager: Or just {disfmarker}\nmarketing: And it will be difficult for the vocabulary also .\nuser interface: Yeah . Check with the v R_ and D_ department the capability of recogniser .\nproject manager: It's difficult to to just say the the name of the channel . It will be difficult to say just the name of the channel .\nuser interface: {vocalsound} Uh ?\nproject manager: Because you have to s t uh a ch\nuser interface: Well , it's convenient for the user .\nproject manager: yeah but you have to to have all the name of the channel in your vocabulary .\nmarketing: Als might be you just forgot the channel name , you kno only know the number .\nproject manager: Or maybe {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: Yeah .\nmarketing: Then {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Or maybe the user can create his own vocabulary ,\nuser interface: The {disfmarker} uh uh mm . {vocalsound} Mm .\nproject manager: just pronouncing the the name of channels and include in the vocabulary .\nuser interface: I I think that I have {disfmarker} mm mm {vocalsound} I think there's another way you can do is that uh you can uh {vocalsound} if {disfmarker} when the user ch press a button to choose the channel for example , then what you can do is that the {disfmarker} you can make the T_V_ screen to split them into small little little squares of images where you you you have a snapshot of every channel , so let's say it's a four by four matrix of the images , so now what you do is f looking at the all the sixteen channels available at one time , you just use the control button uh , you just you you just choose the the option you want\nmarketing: Yeah , the {gap} .\nuser interface: and then you just hit the button and then you go to that channel . So {disfmarker}\nproject manager: Or lets the user create his own vocabulary of channel .\nuser interface: Mm . So you you don't use the speech recogniser in that way .\nproject manager: No . Just you have uh in the beginning you have uh t you have to train {disfmarker} you have to create the vocabulary by yourself .\nuser interface: Oh , okay . Yeah .\nindustrial designer: Well I uh I also {disfmarker}\nproject manager: By associating each channel with the name or {disfmarker}\nindustrial designer: I I also think about uh another problem , if if there is uh more than one person who is watching T_V_ {vocalsound}\nproject manager: And for each one has his own . {vocalsound}\nuser interface: {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: the s well the the speech uh r recogniser should be able to distinguish between the two .\nmarketing: Yeah yeah , {gap} .\nindustrial designer: Because uh I remember when I was a {vocalsound} young child with my sister we {disfmarker} yeah we always want to w to watch different emission at the at the same time\nuser interface: Mm .\nproject manager: Or you have to s {vocalsound}\nuser interface: Yeah , I wanna watch this , I wanna watch that .\nmarketing: Yeah .\nindustrial designer: so it's a pr it could be a problem if uh if well if someone passes by when you are watching T_V_ and say oh T_V_ thirty {vocalsound} and just run , s\nuser interface: Mm .\nmarketing: A and in the same lines we would have a {disfmarker} one more problem . If we are using the television in the different environments , say in the factories or in the shops where there is a lot of noise and this voice commands if they fail to work , that would bring a bad name {disfmarker} bad uh reputation for our company .\nindustrial designer: Yeah , yeah .\nproject manager: Yeah .\nuser interface: Mm .\nproject manager: Mm .\nmarketing: So I think we should specify some pre-requirements if we want to use a voice commands , say that it should be used in an silent homely environment or s something .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound} Yeah .\nproject manager: Or we can switch on or switch off the the special {gap} , yeah .\nmarketing: Yeah that's right that should be an option .\nuser interface: Mm .\nindustrial designer: Yeah that's {disfmarker} well I think that's a good uh a good option because it's simple and uh simple to implement also , so .\nuser interface: Hmm .\nmarketing: I think these are the practical problems . So we need to take care of them in the design .\nproject manager: Maybe we'll discuss them in next meeting .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}"}, {"chapter": 4, "start_ms": 2928000, "topic": "The end of the meeting", "transcript_text": "project manager: It's time to close this meeting .\nuser interface: Well , you you stay a five minutes . {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Okay .\nmarketing: Okay .\nproject manager: {vocalsound} Yeah {gap} . {vocalsound} Okay .\nindustrial designer: {vocalsound}\nmarketing: {vocalsound} Oh it came there on three minutes back so we are {vocalsound} {disfmarker} I think we can just press the okay . {vocalsound}\nindustrial designer: Okay .\nproject manager: Thanks for your collaborations .\nindustrial designer: So I see ya .\nmarketing: Okay . See you another thirty minutes ."}]}
