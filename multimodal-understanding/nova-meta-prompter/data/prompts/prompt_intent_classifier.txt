<intent_taxonomy>
- image_understanding: Prompts involving image analysis, description, extraction, or visual reasoning. Look for image placeholders, references to visual content, or instructions to analyze what is shown.
- video_understanding: Prompts involving video analysis, temporal reasoning, or frame-by-frame understanding. Look for video placeholders, timestamps, or scene analysis instructions.
- document_understanding: Prompts involving PDF processing, document parsing, OCR, form extraction, or structured document analysis. Look for document placeholders or references to pages, tables, forms.
- tool_use: Prompts that instruct the model to call external tools, functions, or APIs. Look for tool definitions, function schemas, or instructions to use specific capabilities.
- structured_output: Prompts requiring specific output formats like JSON, XML, tables, or schemas. Look for format specifications, field definitions, or parsing requirements.
- rag: Prompts involving retrieval-augmented generation, context injection, or grounded responses. Look for context placeholders, retrieved passages, or instructions to answer based on provided information.
- multilingual: Prompts involving translation, multilingual content, or non-English languages. Look for language specifications, translation instructions, or mixed-language content.
- agentic: Prompts involving multi-step reasoning, planning, iterative execution, or autonomous task completion. Look for complex task breakdowns, goal-oriented instructions, or iterative workflows.

<instructions>
1. Read the input prompt carefully
2. For each intent in the taxonomy, determine if the prompt requires that capability
3. A prompt can match multiple intents - identify ALL that apply
4. If the prompt is generic and matches none specifically, return an empty list
5. Base your classification on explicit signals in the prompt, not assumptions about how it might be used
</instructions>

<guidelines>
* Be inclusive - if there's a reasonable signal for an intent, include it
* Look for keywords and phrases that indicate specific capabilities
* Consider both the explicit task and the implied requirements
* A prompt asking for JSON output indicates structured_output
* A prompt with step-by-step task completion suggests agentic
