<tool_use>
<overview>
Nova models are proficient at tool calling. For successful tool calls, the model needs to understand when to use each tool and what inputs to provide. Focus on making tool purposes and boundaries clear within your prompt instructions.
</overview>

<prompt_guidelines>
When instructing the model to use tools in your prompt:
- Clearly describe the purpose of each tool and when it should be used
- Specify the expected input format and any constraints
- Define conditions for choosing between similar tools
- Use tool names directly in instructions, not XML or pythonic references

<example name="tool_selection_guidance">
You have access to the following tools:
- search_web: Use this for current events or real-time information
- search_database: Use this for historical company data and records
- calculator: Use this for any mathematical computations

When answering questions:
1. Determine if the question requires external information or calculation
2. Select the most appropriate tool based on the information source needed
3. If multiple tools are needed, use them in sequence
</example>
</prompt_guidelines>

<structured_output_via_tools>
For use cases requiring structured output, you can instruct the model to use a specific tool that defines your output schema. This ensures consistent, parseable responses.

<example name="structured_extraction">
Extract the following information from the text and provide it using the extract_info tool:
- Customer name
- Order number
- Issue description
- Requested resolution

Text: {input_text}
</example>
</structured_output_via_tools>

<agentic_tool_use>
For agentic workflows where the model should autonomously select tools:
- Provide clear descriptions of each tool's capabilities and limitations
- Include examples of when each tool is appropriate
- Specify any ordering preferences (e.g., "always verify with search before responding")
