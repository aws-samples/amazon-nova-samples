<reasoning_mode>
<overview>
Amazon Nova models support a reasoning mode for complex tasks requiring multiple reasoning steps. When writing prompts for reasoning-intensive tasks, use a top-down approach: start with the big picture and break the problem into smaller subproblems.
</overview>

<when_to_use>
Reasoning mode is recommended for:
- Complex tasks with multiple reasoning steps
- Cross-referencing information across sources
- Error-prone calculations
- Planning with constraints
- Complex classifications
- Tool calling scenarios requiring decision-making
</when_to_use>

<prompt_guidelines>
<top_down_approach>
Structure prompts to guide reasoning from general to specific:
1. State the overall goal or question
2. Break down into component parts
3. Specify how parts should be analyzed
4. Define how to synthesize the final answer
</top_down_approach>

<example name="multi_step_analysis">
Analyze this financial report to determine investment viability.

Steps:
1. First, identify the key financial metrics (revenue, profit margin, debt ratio)
2. Then, compare each metric against industry benchmarks
3. Assess trends over the past 3 years
4. Finally, synthesize your findings into a recommendation with supporting evidence
</example>
</prompt_guidelines>

<reasoning_vs_chain_of_thought>
Choose Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting over reasoning mode when:
- You need transparency and auditability of the reasoning process
- You require custom reasoning structures
- You are developing and debugging prompts
- You want to use hybrid approaches (CoT for development, reasoning mode for production)

Chain of thought makes the reasoning process visible in the output, while reasoning mode optimizes for the final answer.

Before answering, work through this systematically:
1. Identify the key components of the problem
2. Analyze each component
3. Consider how they interact
4. Formulate your conclusion based on this analysis
