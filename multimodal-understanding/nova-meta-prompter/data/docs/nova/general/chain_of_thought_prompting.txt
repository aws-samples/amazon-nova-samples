<introduction>
You can improve the problem solving skills of Amazon Nova by breaking down complex issues into simpler, more manageable tasks or intermediate thoughts. Amazon Nova models work better in reasoning if they are given time to think through the problem and then arrive at the answer. This process of guiding the model to think step-by-step and make attempts at reasoning before arriving at an answer is called chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting.

By guiding Amazon Nova through a step-by-step reasoning process, CoT prompting ensures clearer logic and improves the coherence and accuracy of the output. For example, in tackling a mathematical word problem, the model can first identify the relevant variables, then construct equations based on the given information, and finally solve those equations to reach the solution. This strategy not only minimizes errors but also makes the reasoning process more transparent and easier to follow, thereby enhancing the quality of Amazon Nova output.

<benefits>
Chain of thought is recommended for several reasons:
- Improves the Accuracy: Giving Model chance to first do the thinking before responding, helps model land at a better answer, as compared to asking model directly to think.
- Improves Debugging Process: Sometimes chain of thought reasoning helps debug where and why model made some errors. This feedback is essential to understand how to iterate on prompt to improve the flaws in models reasoning.
</benefits>

<limitations>
Chain of thought is not always necessary, and can induce some additional overhead. Consider not using CoT in the following scenarios:
- Increased Latency and Output Tokens: Chain of Thought can increase the latency as the model is thinking before answering, the increase latency and output tokens can also make the overall inference expensive
- Simpler tasks don't need COT: Not all tasks require deep chain of thought, it is generally recommended to use chain of thought in tasks such as multi-step analysis, math problems, complex reasoning tasks.
