{"id": "ten-search", "prompt": "Instructions:\n- First, provide a scratchpad section for your initial thoughts, observations, and relevant information about the search query and product. This section is for your internal use and doesn't need to be structured.\n- Second, identify and analyze the search query (translating to English if necessary). Identify key terms, brand names, model numbers, and specifications. Determine the user's likely intent based on the query. Consider any cultural or regional context if relevant.\n- Third, identify and review the product information (translating to English if necessary). Examine the product name, bullet points, type, and any other provided details. Consider multiple aspects such as functionality, target audience, and price range.\n- Fourth, compare the query to the product. Look for exact matches in brand, model, and specifications. Identify similarities in function, purpose, or features. Consider how the product relates to or enhances the queried item.\n- Then, apply the ESCI Classification, think step by step:\n  a) Exact: Check if all key elements of the query match the product precisely. Ensure that brand, model, specifications, and intended use align perfectly.\n  b) Substitute: If not an exact match, determine if the product serves the same primary function. Compare specifications and features to see if they're similar enough to be a viable alternative.\n  c) Complement: If not exact or substitute, consider if the product enhances or is commonly used with the queried item. Evaluate whether it's a logical accessory or add-on for the primary product.\n  d) Irrelevant: If the product doesn't fit any of the above categories, classify it as irrelevant. Check for coincidental keyword matches that might have caused the product to appear in results.\n- Validate the classification by reviewing the chosen category against its description to ensure accuracy. Consider edge cases or potential ambiguities.\n- Finally, provide justification in the scratchpad, explaining the reasoning behind the classification choice and highlighting key factors that led to the decision. Provide your final ESCI label for the product result: exact/substitute/complement/irrelevant.\n\nYour output MUST ALWAYS be in json format as follows and you WILL NOT wrap it in json markers:\n\nPlease think step by step first before making any attempt at classification.\n\nYour response should only be in JSON object as shown:\nResponse Schema:\n{'scratchpad': text, 'esci': string label}  // the Label name (ie. exact, substitute, irrelevant, complement)"}

Your analysis should be based on pattern recognition, statistical inference, and consumer behavior principles.\n\n<current_date>\n{{ current_date }}\n</current_date>\nUse this current date as your reference point for all temporal inferences.\n\nHere is the purchase history you need to analyze:\n\n<purchase_history>\n{{ purchase_history }}\n</purchase_history>\n\nYour task is to analyze this purchase history and provide insights into the household's demographics of the customer. Please follow these steps step by step in your analysis.\n\n1. Household Demographics Analysis\n   a. Categorize purchases into:\n      - Food & groceries (note specific dietary patterns)\n      - Personal care (gender-specific and age-specific items)\n      - Clothing (sizes, styles, gender orientation)\n      - Baby/child products (note specific age ranges)\n      - Pet care related products (food types/sizes, toys, grooming supplies, medical care, accessories)\n      - Healthcare items (prescription patterns, specific conditions)\n      - Entertainment/hobbies\n      - Seasonal/holiday purchases\n\n   b. Identify purchase patterns for each potential household member:\n      - Regular recurring purchases (weekly/monthly)\n      - Size progression for age-dependent items (children's clothing, diapers)\n      - Gender-specific products (strictly classify as Male/Female based only)\n      - Life-stage indicators (baby items, teen products, senior care)\n\n   c. Note purchase timing patterns:\n      - Weekday vs. weekend shopping\n      - Morning/afternoon/evening purchases\n      - Seasonal variations\n      - Back-to-school or holiday-related purchases\n\n   d. Apply evidence standards for confidence ratings:\n      - High confidence: 5+ consistent purchases clearly indicating a household member with temporal patterns\n      - Medium confidence: 3-5 suggestive purchases with logical connection but less consistency\n      - Low confidence: 1-2 purchases with weak demographic indicators\n      - Insufficient evidence: Mark as `N/A` when purchases do not meet minimum criteria\n\n   e. Create a household profile with:\n      - Estimated number of adults with likely age ranges [STRICTLY use: 18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65+] and genders [Male/Female ONLY]\n      - Estimated number of children with likely age ranges [STRICTLY use: 0-6 months, 6-12 months, 1-2, 3-5, 6-8, 9-11, 12-13, 14-17] and genders [Male/Female ONLY]\n      - Age progression indicators over time, considering that overlapping age-appropriate products may indicate one child in developmental transition\n\n   f. Analyze pet-related purchases for multiple pets:\n      - Different food types/brands suggesting multiple pet types\n      - Various toy sizes indicating different pet ages\n      - Multiple feeding schedules or portion sizes\n      - Specialized products for different pet needs\n      - Veterinary or grooming products for different animals\n      - Pet accessories in different sizes or styles\n      - Consider purchase quantities that might indicate multiple pets\n\n**Important considerations for your analysis:**\n- Apply evidence standards rigorously - insufficient evidence is better than speculation\n- Consider multiple alternative explanations before drawing conclusions\n- Mark fields as `N/A` when insufficient evidence exists\n- Connect specific purchases to each demographic inference\n- Consider temporal patterns and both presence and absence of expected purchase types\n\n**PRIVACY AND SENSITIVITY GUIDELINES:**\n- Keep all reasoning professional and general - avoid mentioning specific sensitive product names or medical conditions\n- Focus on product categories rather than specific items when discussing health, personal care, or medical purchases\n- Use neutral, clinical language when describing demographic indicators\n- Avoid detailed speculation about personal circumstances, habits, or conditions\n- Do not include potentially embarrassing or private details in reasoning sections\n- When referencing healthcare items, use general terms like `personal health products` or `medical supplies`\n\nAfter your analysis, provide your findings in the JSON format enclosed with <output_format> tag:\n\n<output_format>\n{\n  'household_composition': {\n    'adults': {\n      'count': <number or 'N/A'>,\n      'confidence_level': '<high/medium/low>',\n      'reasoning': '<explanation with specific purchase evidence>'\n    },\n    'minors': {\n      'count': <number or 'N/A'>,\n      'confidence_level': '<high/medium/low>',\n      'reasoning': '<explanation with specific purchase evidence>'\n    },\n    'pets': {\n      'present': <true/false/'N/A'>,\n      'total_count': <number or 'N/A'>,\n      'confidence_level': '<high/medium/low>',\n      'reasoning': '<explanation with specific purchase evidence>',\n      'individual_pets': [\n        {\n          'pet_id': 1,\n          'type': '<dog/cat/fish/reptile/bird/rabbit/etc. or N/A>',\n          'likely_age': '<puppy/kitten/young/adult/senior/N/A>',\n          'confidence_level': '<high/medium/low>',\n          'reasoning': '<explanation with specific purchase evidence>'\n        }\n      ]\n    }\n  },\n  'household_members': [\n    {\n      'member_id': 1,\n      'likely_role': '<adult/child>',\n      'likely_age': '<age range or N/A>',\n      'likely_gender': '<male/female/N/A>',\n      'confidence_level': '<high/medium/low>',\n      'reasoning': '<explanation with specific purchase evidence>'\n    }\n  ]\n}\n</output_format>\n\nPlease ensure your output adheres to this structure while providing detailed, insightful content based on your analysis."}
