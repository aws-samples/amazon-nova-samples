<overview>
Amazon Nova models support a reasoning mode for complex tasks requiring multiple reasoning steps. When writing prompts for reasoning-intensive tasks, use a top-down approach: start with the big picture and break the problem into smaller subproblems.

<prompt_guidelines>
<top_down_approach>
Structure prompts to guide reasoning from general to specific:
1. State the overall goal or question
2. Break down into component parts
3. Specify how parts should be analyzed
4. Define how to synthesize the final answer

<example name="multi_step_analysis">

Steps:
1. First, identify the key financial metrics (revenue, profit margin, debt ratio)
2. Then, compare each metric against industry benchmarks
3. Assess trends over the past 3 years
4. Finally, synthesize your findings into a recommendation with supporting evidence

{query}

Before answering, work through this systematically:
1. Identify the key components of the problem
2. Analyze each component
3. Consider how they interact
4. Formulate your conclusion based on this analysis
