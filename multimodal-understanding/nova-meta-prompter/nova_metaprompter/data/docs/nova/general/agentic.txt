<overview>
Agentic prompts enable multi-step reasoning, planning, iterative execution, and autonomous task completion. When writing prompts for agentic workflows, focus on clear goal definition, step breakdown, and decision-making guidance.
</overview>

<prompt_structure>
Agentic prompts should include:
1. Clear goal or objective
2. Available actions or capabilities
3. Decision-making criteria
4. Completion conditions
5. Output expectations at each step
</prompt_structure>

<goal_definition>
<example name="clear_objective">
## Goal
Research and compile a competitive analysis report for {company_name}.

## Success Criteria
The task is complete when you have:
- Identified at least 3 main competitors
- Analyzed each competitor's strengths and weaknesses
- Compared pricing and feature sets
- Provided strategic recommendations
</example>
</goal_definition>

<step_breakdown>
<example name="iterative_task">
Complete the following task step by step:

## Task
Analyze customer feedback and generate improvement recommendations.

## Steps
1. First, categorize all feedback into themes (product, service, pricing, other)
2. For each theme, identify the top 3 issues by frequency
3. For each top issue, propose a specific improvement
4. Prioritize improvements by potential impact
5. Summarize your findings and recommendations

After each step, briefly state what you found before proceeding to the next step.
</example>
</step_breakdown>

<decision_making>
<example name="conditional_actions">
You are helping a user troubleshoot a technical issue.

## Decision Framework
- If the issue is related to login: First verify account status, then check credentials
- If the issue is related to performance: First check system requirements, then review logs
- If the issue is unclear: Ask clarifying questions before proceeding

## Process
1. Understand the issue from the user's description
2. Apply the appropriate decision path
3. Work through the troubleshooting steps
4. Provide a solution or escalate if unresolved
</example>
</decision_making>

<planning_with_constraints>
<example name="constrained_planning">
## Task
Create a project plan for {project_description}.

## Constraints
- Budget: {budget}
- Timeline: {timeline}
- Team size: {team_size}

## Planning Requirements
1. Break the project into phases
2. Identify dependencies between tasks
3. Allocate resources within constraints
4. Identify risks and mitigation strategies
5. Define milestones and deliverables

Ensure your plan respects all constraints. If constraints make the project infeasible, explain why and suggest adjustments.
</example>
</planning_with_constraints>

<iteration_and_refinement>
<example name="iterative_improvement">
## Task
Draft and refine a {document_type}.

## Process
1. Create an initial draft based on the requirements
2. Review the draft for completeness and clarity
3. Identify areas for improvement
4. Revise the draft addressing identified issues
5. Perform a final review

Present your work at each stage, explaining your reasoning for changes.
</example>
</iteration_and_refinement>

<best_practices>
- Define clear success criteria so the model knows when the task is complete
- Break complex tasks into explicit steps
- Provide decision frameworks for handling different scenarios
- Include checkpoints for the model to verify progress
- Specify what information to retain or report at each step
- Use phrases like "work through this systematically" or "complete each step before proceeding"
</best_practices>
