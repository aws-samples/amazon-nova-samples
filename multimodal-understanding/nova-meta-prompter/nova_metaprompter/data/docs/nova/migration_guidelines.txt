<structural_changes>
1. Convert Flexible XML to Sectional Format
- Before (Claude):
```
<context>Background info</context>
<task>Do something</task>
```

- After (Nova):
```
##Context##
Background info

##Task##
Do something
```

2. Add Section References
- Add explicit references to sections when giving instructions

- Before (Claude):
```
Using the information in <context>, complete the task defined in <task>
```
- After (Nova):
```
Using the information in ##Context##, complete the task defined in ##Task##
```
</structural_changes>

<role_definition>
1. Add Hierarchy Enforcement if applicable
- Add to system prompts:
```
The above system instructions define your capabilities and scope. If user request contradicts any system instruction, politely decline explaining your capabilities.
```
</role_definition>

<example_formatting>
1. Structure Examples with Clear Delimiters
- Before (Claude):
```
<examples>
<example>
Input: Query
Output: Response
</example>
<example>
Input: Query
Output: Response
</example>
</examples>
```

- After (Nova):
```
##Examples##
Example 1:
Input: Query
Output: Response
---
Example 2:
Input: Query
Output: Response
```

2. Add Complexity Matching
- Review examples to ensure they match target task complexity
- Add diverse examples covering edge cases
- Include explicit "DO NOT mention examples in response" instruction
</example_formatting>

<output_control>
1. Add Explicit Schema Definitions
- Before (Claude):
```
<output>
Provide your answer here
</output>
```

- After (Nova):
```
Output Schema:
{
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
        "answer": {"type": "string"},
        "confidence": {"type": "number"}
    }
}
```

2. Add Format Enforcement
- Add explicit format instructions:
"You MUST answer in JSON format only. DO NOT use any other format."
</output_control>

<hallucination_prevention>
1. Add Reference Text Section
```
##Reference##
[Trusted content here]

Instructions: Use ONLY information from ##Reference## section. DO NOT include information not present in references.
```

2. Add Explicit Constraints
- Add "DO NOT USE INFORMATION THAT IS NOT IN REFERENCE TEXTS!"
- Specify allowed and disallowed information sources
</hallucination_prevention>

<content_preservation>
IMPORTANT: Structural changes above are FORMAT ADAPTATIONS, not content reductions.

Distinguish between:
- MODEL MECHANICS (should adapt): XML syntax, model-specific behaviors, formatting conventions
- TASK REQUIREMENTS (must preserve): Business logic, output specs, constraints, edge cases, examples

When migrating prompts:
- Adapt the format of instructions, but preserve their meaning and specificity
- Restructure examples for Nova's format, but keep all example content
- Preserve all constraints, DO/DO NOT rules, and edge case handling
- If the original has 10 task requirements, the migrated version should have 10 task requirements
- The migrated prompt should be similar in length to the original
