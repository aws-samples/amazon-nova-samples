# LLM as a Judge: Customer Feedback Analysis with AWS Bedrock Models

## Overview
This repository contains code for analyzing customer feedback using AWS Bedrock's language models (Nova Pro and Claude Sonnet). The notebook implements a pipeline for thematic analysis of text data, followed by evaluation of the generated themes using newer pre-trained LLMs for an LLM-as-a-judge approach. The end to end LLM-as-a-judge system processes customer comments, extracts themes using an LLM, and then evaluates theme alignment using multiple AI models to represent different personas. 

Amazon Bedrock Nova Premier is Amazon's advanced large language model (LLM) designed specifically for complex reasoning tasks and agentic applications. This sample code demonstrate how to leverage Nova Premier's capabilities to build similar AI as a judge solutions for your next application.

## üåü Key Features
- Theme Extraction: Automated analysis of customer feedback
- Multi-Model Analysis: Parallel processing with Nova Premier and Claude
- Statistical Evaluation: Comprehensive inter-rater reliability metrics
- AWS Integration: Seamless S3 and Bedrock API integration
- Real-time Processing: Efficient streaming response handling
