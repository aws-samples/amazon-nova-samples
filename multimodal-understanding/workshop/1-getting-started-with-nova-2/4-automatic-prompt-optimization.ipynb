    "Manually rewriting prompts for each model's strengths is time-consuming, especially when migrating between foundation models. Amazon Bedrock offers **Prompt Optimization**, a feature that automatically rewrites your prompts to improve performance on a target model.\n",

    "1. **Using the OptimizePrompt API** — programmatically optimize prompts via `bedrock-agent-runtime`\n",
    "2. **Optimizing real-world prompts** — converting verbose XML-structured prompts into optimized versions\n",
    "3. **Comparing original vs. optimized outputs** — side-by-side evaluation\n",
    "4. **Using the console** — a visual walkthrough of prompt optimization in the Amazon Bedrock console\n",
