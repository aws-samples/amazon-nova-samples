       "\n",
       "1. **Check Signal Strength:**  \n",
       "   - Ensure your router is placed in a central location, away from walls, metal objects, or other electronics that might interfere with the signal.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Restart Your Equipment:**  \n",
       "   - Turn off your modem and router. Wait about 30 seconds, then turn them back on. This can help reset any temporary glitches.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Run a Speed Test:**  \n",
       "   - Use a site like [speedtest.net](https://www.speedtest.net) at different times in the evening to see if speeds drop consistently. Share your results with me if you can.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Check for Network Congestion:**  \n",
       "   - Many users are online in the evenings, which can cause slower speeds. If possible, try scheduling tasks during off-peak hours or contacting your ISP for a network status update.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Wi-Fi Channel Optimization:**  \n",
       "   - Log into your router’s admin panel (usually through a web browser) and change your Wi-Fi channel to a less congested one. Many routers have an “auto” setting, but manually selecting channel 1, 6, or 11 can sometimes help.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Firmware Updates:**  \n",
       "   - Make sure your router’s firmware is up to date. This can often be done through the admin panel.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. **Contact Support for Further Investigation:**  \n",
       "   - If the issue persists after trying the above steps, I can escalate this to our technical team. They can check for any known service outages in your area or inspect line quality from our side.\n",
       "\n",
       "---\n",

    "This notebook covered the core prompting best practices for Amazon Nova 2 models:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **System role**: Define persona, instructions, output format, and guardrails to control model behavior across all turns\n",
    "- **Precise prompts**: Clearly specify the task, role, format, and constraints for better results\n",
    "- **Few-shot examples**: Provide diverse, relevant examples to guide the model's output style and reasoning\n",
    "- **Structured outputs**: Use JSON schema in the prompt, assistant prefilling, or tool use with constrained decoding for parseable output\n",
    "\n",
