This Section 2(b) shall be construed so that the Notes are at all times maintained in “registered form” within the meaning of Sections 163(f), 871(h)(2) and 881(c)(2) of the Code, and any related regulations (or any successor provisions of the Code or such regulations). (c) Interest Calculations. Interest shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed, consisting of twelve 30 calendar day periods, and shall accrue daily (but without compounding) commencing on the Original Issue Date until payment in full of the outstanding principal, together with all accrued and unpaid interest and other amounts which may become due hereunder, has been made. Interest shall cease to accrue with respect to any principal amount converted, provided that, the Company actually delivers the Conversion Shares within the time period required by Section 4(e)(ii). Interest hereunder will be paid to the Person in whose name this Note is registered on the Note Register. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, for the purposes of the Interest Act (Canada), and disclosure thereunder, to the extent that the Interest Act (Canada) is applicable to this Note and the Company’s obligations hereunder, whenever any interest or any fee to be paid under this Note or in connection there with is to be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year, the yearly rate of interest to which the rate used in such calculation is equivalent is the rate so used multiplied by the actual number of days in the calendar year in which the same is to be ascertained and divided by 360. The rates of interest under this Note are nominal rates, and not effective rates or yields. The principle of deemed reinvestment of interest does not apply to any interest calculation under this Note. The foregoing shall not be deemed to be an acknowledgement that the Interest Act (Canada) applies to this Note or the Company’s obligations hereunder. (d) [Reserved]
13 (e) Prepayment. Except as otherwise set forth in this Note (including Section 6 hereof), the Company may not prepay any portion of the principal amount of this Note without the prior written consent of the Holder. (f) Original Issue Discount. This Note was issued with an original issue discount of $______. The Company understands and agrees that such original issue discount is fully earned by the Holder on the Original Issue Date and no part thereof shall be refundable. The Company further understands and agrees that such original issue discount is compensation for the foregone use of money and not a fee for services. (g) Application of Payments. All payments made under this Note shall be applied first to the payment of any fees or charges outstanding pursuant to the Transaction Documents, second to interest to the Holder on the aggregate unconverted and then outstanding principal amount of this Note in accordance with the provisions hereof, third, to other amounts due and payable hereunder other than the outstanding principal, and fourth, to the payment of the principal amount outstanding under the Note. Section 3. Registration of Transfers and Exchanges. (a) Different Denominations. This Note is exchangeable for an equal aggregate principal amount of Notes of different authorized denominations, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same. No service charge will be payable for such registration of transfer or exchange. (b) Investment Representations. This Note has been issued subject to certain investment representations of the original Holder set forth in the Purchase Agreement and may be transferred or exchanged only in compliance with the Purchase Agreement and applicable federal and state securities laws and regulations. (c) Reliance on Note Register. Prior to due presentment for transfer to the Company of this Note, the Company and any agent of the Company may treat the Person in whose name this Note is duly registered on the Note Register as the owner hereof for the purpose of receiving payment as herein provided and for all other purposes, whether or not this Note is overdue, and neither the Company nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary. Section 4. Monthly Redemption; Permissive Conversion. (a) Unless the Company elects the alternate procedure set forth in Section 4(b), the Company shall pay the Monthly Redemption Amount plus a premium of eight percent (8%) of the Monthly Redemption Amount to the Holder in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds on each Monthly Redemption Date (the “Monthly Redemption”). (b) Subject to the satisfaction (or written waiver by Holder) of the Equity Conditions on the Monthly Redemption Notice Date and subject to any Beneficial Ownership
14 Limitation (as defined below), in lieu of paying the Monthly Redemption Amount in cash on a particular Monthly Redemption Date, the Company may, by delivering an irrevocable written notice to Holder no later than 2 Trading Days’ prior to the applicable Monthly Redemption Date (the “Monthly Redemption Notice” and such required date of delivery, the “Monthly Redemption Notice Date”), permit the Holder to convert the Monthly Redemption Amount into Freely Tradable shares of Common Stock (“Conversion Shares”) during the period commencing on (and including) the Monthly Redemption Date and ending on and including the last Trading Day of the applicable month (the “Monthly Redemption Period” and such election a “Monthly Conversion Election”). Following the delivery by the Company of a valid Monthly Redemption Notice, at any time, and from time to time, during the applicable Monthly Redemption Period, the Holder may submit one or more written notices to the Company (a “Conversion Notice”) to convert all or a portion of the Monthly Redemption Amount based on a conversion price equal to the lower of (but not to be lower than the Floor Price): (1) the Fixed Price then in effect and (2) 92% of the lowest daily VWAP during the 7 consecutive Trading Days ending on and including the date of the applicable Conversion Notice, subject to the last sentence of this Section 4(b) (the date of the Conversion Notice, the “Conversion Date” and such conversion price, the “Conversion Price”). Each Conversion Notice shall specify the amount of the Monthly Redemption Amount to be converted and the Conversion Price. No ink-original Conversion Notice shall be required, nor shall any medallion guarantee (or other type of guarantee or notarization) of any Conversion Notice form be required. Each conversion pursuant to this Section 4(b) shall be applied (a) first, to pay accrued Interest as of the applicable Conversion Date (if any) and (b) second, to reduce the applicable Monthly Redemption Amount. Any portion of a Monthly Redemption Amount subject to a Monthly Conversion Election that is Deferred by the Investor shall remain convertible into Conversion Shares in accordance with this Section 4(b) regardless of the Company’s election of Section 4(a) or Section 4(b) with respect to any subsequent Monthly Redemption. On or before the first (1st) Trading Day following the date of receipt of a Conversion Notice with respect to a conversion under this Section 4(b), if the applicable Conversion Price is less than the conversion price specified on such Conversion Notice, the Holder may deliver an updated Conversion Notice to the Company correcting the Conversion Price (and aggregate number of Conversion Shares to be issued) as specified in such Conversion Notice; provided, that if such updated Conversion Notice is not delivered to the Company on or prior to 9:30am, New York time on the Trading Day immediately following the applicable Conversion Date, the applicable Share Delivery Date shall be extended by one (1) Trading Day; provided further that the Conversion Price shall never be lower than the Floor Price. (c) Deferral. The Holder may, at any time prior to a Monthly Redemption Date (in the case of a Monthly Redemption in cash pursuant to Section 4(a)), or during the Monthly Redemption Period (in the case of a Monthly Conversion Election pursuant to Section 4(b)), defer all or any portion of the applicable Monthly Redemption Amount (“Deferred” and amount Deferred a “Deferral Amount”) to a later date at its sole discretion. (d) Permissive Conversion. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Holder, may at its sole option and election, at any time and from time, submit a Conversion Notice for any portion of the outstanding principal amount of this Note, accrued and unpaid interest thereon and other amounts due and payable under the Transaction Documents using
15 $_____ (subject to adjustment as provided herein, the “Fixed Price”) as the “Conversion Price,” but subject always to the Beneficial Ownership Limitation, the Floor Price and the Nasdaq Share Cap. (e) Delivery of Conversion Shares. (i) Conversion Shares Issuable Upon Conversion. The number of Conversion Shares issuable upon a conversion under Section 4(b) or Section 4(c) shall be determined by the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the amount of the applicable obligations under this Note and other Transaction Documents to be converted by (y) the Conversion Price. (ii) Delivery of Conversion Shares Upon Conversion. Not later than the number of Trading Days comprising the Standard Settlement Period (as defined below) after each Conversion Date (the “Share Delivery Date”), the Company shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Holder the Conversion Shares which shall be Freely Tradable and free of restrictive legends representing the number of Conversion Shares being acquired upon the conversion of this Note. The Company shall deliver any Conversion Shares required to be delivered by the Company under this Section 4(e) electronically through the Depository Trust Company or another established clearing corporation performing similar functions. As used herein, “Standard Settlement Period” means the standard settlement period, expressed in a number of Trading Days, on the Principal Market as in effect on the date of delivery of the Conversion Notice. To the extent that the delivery of Conversion Shares in connection with a Conversion Notice would result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation, and the Holder does not elect in writing to withdraw, in whole, such Conversion Notice, the Company shall hold such Conversion Shares in abeyance for the benefit of the Holder until such time as such Conversion Notice may be satisfied without exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation (with such calculations thereunder made as of the date such Conversion Notice was initially delivered to the Company). (iii) [RESERVED] (iv) Failure to Deliver Conversion Shares. If, in the case of any Conversion Notice, such Conversion Shares are not delivered to or as directed by the applicable Holder by the Share Delivery Date, the Holder shall be entitled to elect by written notice to the Company at any time on or before its receipt of such Conversion Shares, to rescind such Conversion Notice, in which event the Company shall promptly return to the Holder any original Note delivered to the Company and the Holder shall promptly return to the Company the Conversion Shares issued to such Holder pursuant to the rescinded Conversion Notice. (v) Obligation Absolute. The Company’s obligations to issue and deliver the Conversion Shares upon conversion of this Note in accordance with the terms hereof are absolute and unconditional, irrespective of any action or inaction by the Holder to enforce the same, any waiver or consent with respect to any provision hereof, the recovery of any judgment against any Person or any action to enforce the same, or any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, limitation or termination, or any breach or alleged breach by the Holder or any other Person of any obligation to the Company or any violation or alleged violation of law by the Holder or any other Person, and irrespective of any other circumstance which might otherwise limit such obligation of
16 the Company to the Holder in connection with the issuance of such Conversion Shares; provided, however, that such delivery shall not operate as a waiver by the Company of any such action the Company may have against the Holder. In connection with the Holder’s conversion of amounts due under this Note in accordance with the terms of the Note, the Company may not refuse conversion based on any claim that the Holder or anyone associated or affiliated with the Holder has been engaged in any violation of law, agreement or for any other reason, unless an injunction from a court, on notice to Holder, restraining and or enjoining conversion of all or part of this Note shall have been sought and obtained, and the Company posts a surety bond for the benefit of the Holder in the amount of 150% of the outstanding principal amount of this Note, which is subject to the injunction, which bond shall remain in effect until the completion of arbitration/litigation of the underlying dispute and the proceeds of which shall be payable to the Holder to the extent it obtains judgment. In the absence of such injunction, the Company shall issue Conversion Shares and, if applicable, cash, upon a properly noticed conversion. Nothing in this Note shall limit a Holder’s right (1) to pursue actual damages, or (2) declare an Event of Default pursuant to Section 8 for the Company’s failure to deliver Conversion Shares within the period specified herein. Without limiting the foregoing, the Holder shall have the right to pursue all remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief. The exercise of any such rights shall not prohibit the Holder from seeking to enforce damages pursuant to any other Section hereof or under applicable law. (vi) Compensation for Buy-In on Failure to Timely Deliver Conversion Shares Upon Conversion. In addition to any other rights available to the Holder, if the Company fails for any reason to deliver to the Holder such Conversion Shares by the Share Delivery Date pursuant to Section 4(e)(ii), and if after such Share Delivery Date the Holder is required by its brokerage firm to purchase (in an open market transaction or otherwise), or the Holder’s brokerage firm otherwise purchases, shares of Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by the Holder of the Conversion Shares which the Holder was entitled to receive upon the conversion relating to such Share Delivery Date (a “Buy-In”), then the Company shall (A) pay in cash to the Holder (in addition to any other remedies available to or elected by the Holder) the amount, if any, by which (x) the Holder’s total purchase price (including any brokerage commissions) for the Common Stock so purchased exceeds (y) the product of (1) the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that the Holder was entitled to receive from the conversion at issue multiplied by (2) the actual sale price at which the sell order giving rise to such purchase obligation was executed (including any brokerage commissions) and (B) at the option of the Holder, either reissue (if surrendered) this Note in a principal amount equal to the principal amount of the attempted conversion (in which case such conversion shall be deemed rescinded) or deliver to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock that would have been issued if the Company had timely complied with its delivery requirements under Section 4(e)(ii). For example, if the Holder purchases Common Stock having a total purchase price of $11,000 to cover a Buy-In with respect to an attempted conversion of this Note with respect to which the actual sale price of the Conversion Shares (including any brokerage commissions) giving rise to such purchase obligation was a total of $10,000 under clause (A) of the immediately preceding sentence, the Company shall be required to pay the Holder $1,000. The Holder shall provide the Company written notice indicating the amounts payable to the Holder in respect of the Buy-In and, upon request of the Company, evidence of the amount of such loss.
17 (vii) Reservation of Shares Issuable Upon Conversion. The Company covenants that it will at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock for the sole purpose of issuance upon conversion of this Note as herein provided, free from preemptive rights or any other actual contingent purchase rights of Persons other than the Holder, an aggregate number of Common Stock equal to is 30,214,856. Following the Nasdaq Stockholder Approval the Company shall increase such share reserve to, and keep continually reserved for issuance at all times, a number of shares of Common Stock equal to 150% of the aggregate number of shares issuable upon conversion of this Note in full at the Conversion Price then in effect without regard to any limitations on conversion. The Company covenants that all Common Stock that shall be so issuable shall, upon issue, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. The Company acknowledges and agrees that the purpose of this Section 4(e)(vii) is to ensure that Company may issue shares of Common Stock from time to time in accordance with the terms hereof and that the reservation of Common Stock pursuant hereto is reasonable in light of the anticipated economic benefits expected by the Company and Holder from conversions of this Note by the Holder. The Company further understands that there are no limitations imposed by Holder on the Company’s ability to, any time, increase the number of its authorized and unissued Common Stock and it is the sole responsibility of the Company to ensure that it has sufficient authorized and unissued Common Stock to comply with its obligations hereunder and to take advantage of opportunities to raise capital from the sale of its securities to third parties. Accordingly, there shall be no presumption that Holder’s requirement that the Company adhere to this Section 4(e)(vii) causes Holder to have any control over the Company’s ability to dispose of authorized and unissued Common Stock. (viii) Fractional Shares. No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of this Note. As to any fraction of a share which the Holder would otherwise be entitled to purchase upon such conversion, the Company shall at its election, either pay a cash adjustment in respect of such final fraction in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by the Conversion Price or round up to the next whole share. (ix) Transfer Taxes and Expenses. The issuance of Conversion Shares on conversion of this Note shall be made without charge to the Holder hereof for any documentary stamp or similar taxes that may be payable in respect of the issue or delivery of such Conversion Shares, provided that the Company shall not be required to pay any tax that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance and delivery of any such Conversion Shares upon conversion in a name other than that of the Holder of this Note so converted and the Company shall not be required to issue or deliver such Conversion Shares unless or until the Person or Persons requesting the issuance thereof shall have paid to the Company the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Company that such tax has been paid. The Company shall pay all Transfer Agent fees required for same-day processing of any Conversion Notice and all fees to the Depository Trust Company (or another established clearing corporation performing similar functions) required for same-day electronic delivery of the Conversion Shares. (f) Holder’s Conversion Limitations. The Company shall not effect any conversion of this Note, and a Holder shall not have the right to convert any portion of this Note, to the extent that after giving effect to the applicable conversion, the Holder (together with the
18 Holder’s Affiliates, and any other Persons acting as a group together with the Holder or any of the Holder’s Affiliates (such Persons, “Attribution Parties”)) would beneficially own in excess of the Beneficial Ownership Limitation (as defined below). For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by the Holder and its Affiliates and Attribution Parties shall include the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note with respect to which such determination is being made, but shall exclude the number of shares of Common Stock which would be issuable upon (i) conversion of the remaining, unconverted principal amount of this Note beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its Affiliates or Attribution Parties and (ii) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or unconverted portion of any other securities of the Company subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained herein (including, without limitation, any other Notes or the Warrants) beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its Affiliates or Attribution Parties. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, for purposes of this Section 4(f), beneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. In addition, a determination as to any group status as contemplated above shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. For purposes of this Section 4(f), in determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, the Holder may rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock as reflected in (A) the Company’s most recent periodic or annual report filed with the Commission, as the case may be, (B) a more recent public announcement by the Company, or (C) a more recent written notice by the Company or the Transfer Agent setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding. Upon the written or oral request of a Holder, the Company shall within one Trading Day confirm orally and in writing to the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding. In any case, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Company, including this Note, by the Holder or its Affiliates since the date as of which such number of outstanding shares of Common Stock was reported. The “Beneficial Ownership Limitation” shall be 9.99% of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note. The Holder, upon notice to the Company, may increase the Beneficial Ownership Limitation provisions of this Section 4(f), provided that the Beneficial Ownership Limitation in no event exceeds 9.99% of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of this Note held by the Holder and the Beneficial Ownership Limitation provisions of this Section 4(f) shall continue to apply. Any increase in the Beneficial Ownership Limitation will not be effective until the 61st day after such notice is delivered to the Company. The Beneficial Ownership Limitation provisions of this paragraph shall be construed and implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict conformity with the terms of this Section 4(f) to correct this paragraph (or any portion hereof) which may be defective or inconsistent with the intended Beneficial Ownership Limitation contained herein or to make changes or supplements necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such limitation. The limitations contained in this paragraph shall apply to a successor holder of this Note. (g) Nasdaq Share Cap. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Note, prior to the receipt of Nasdaq Stockholder Approval, the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of all Notes in the aggregate will be subject to, and shall not exceed, the Nasdaq
19 Share Cap. Prior to the receipt of Nasdaq Stockholder Approval, (i) if the Company receives a Conversion Notice from more than one Holder of Notes for the same Conversion Date and, due to the Nasdaq Share Cap, the Company can convert some, but not all, of such Notes submitted for conversion on such date into Common Stock, then the Company shall convert from each Holder of Notes electing to have Notes converted on such Conversion Date a pro rata amount of such Holder’s portion of its Notes submitted for conversion based on the principal amount of Notes submitted for conversion on such date by such Holder relative to the aggregate principal amount of all Notes submitted for conversion on such Conversion Date; (ii) the Company shall be entitled to settle conversions of Notes in shares of Common Stock only up to the Nasdaq Share Cap; and (iii) any Notes surrendered for conversion for which any shares of Common Stock are not required to be delivered pursuant to this Section 4(g) shall not be converted or extinguished and shall instead be returned to the Holders and shall remain outstanding. Section 5. Adjustments. (a) Fundamental Transaction. If, at any time while this Note is outstanding, (i) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions effects any merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another Person, (ii) the Company (and all of its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole), directly or indirectly, effects any sale, lease, license, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of its assets in one or a series of related transactions, (iii) any, direct or indirect, purchase offer, tender offer or exchange offer (whether by the Company or another Person) is completed pursuant to which holders of Common Stock are permitted to sell, tender or exchange their shares for other securities, cash or property and has been accepted by the holders of 50% or more of the outstanding Common Stock, (iv) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions effects any reclassification, reorganization or recapitalization of the Common Stock or any compulsory share exchange pursuant to which the Common Stock is effectively converted into or exchanged for other securities, cash or property, or (v) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions consummates a stock or share purchase agreement or other business combination (including, without limitation, a reorganization, recapitalization, spin-off, merger or scheme of arrangement) with another Person or group of Persons whereby such other Person or group acquires more than 50% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (not including any shares of Common Stock held by the other Person or other Persons making or party to, or associated or affiliated with the other Persons making or party to, such stock or share purchase agreement or other business combination) (each a “Fundamental Transaction”), then, upon any subsequent conversion of this Note, the Holder shall have the right to receive, for each Conversion Share (assuming conversion at the Fixed Price) that would have been issuable upon such conversion immediately prior to the occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction (without regard to any limitation in Section 4(e)), the number of shares of Common Stock of the successor or acquiring corporation or of the Company, if it is the surviving corporation, and any additional consideration (the “Alternate Consideration”) receivable as a result of such Fundamental Transaction by a holder of the number of shares of Common Stock for which this Note is convertible immediately prior to such Fundamental Transaction (without regard to any limitation in Section 4(e)). For purposes of any such conversion, the determination of the Fixed Price shall be appropriately adjusted to apply to such Alternate Consideration based on the amount of Alternate Consideration issuable in respect
20 of one (1) share of Common Stock in such Fundamental Transaction, and the Company shall apportion the Fixed Price among the Alternate Consideration in a reasonable manner reflecting the relative value of any different components of the Alternate Consideration. If holders of Common Stock are given any choice as to the securities, cash or property to be received in a Fundamental Transaction, then the Holder shall be given the same choice as to the Alternate Consideration it receives upon any conversion of this Note following such Fundamental Transaction. The Company shall cause any successor entity in a Fundamental Transaction in which the Company is not the survivor (the “Successor Entity”) to assume in writing all of the obligations of the Company under this Note and the other Transaction Documents (as defined in the Purchase Agreement) in accordance with the provisions of this Section 5(a) pursuant to written agreements in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Holder and approved by the Holder (without unreasonable delay) prior to such Fundamental Transaction and shall, at the option of the holder of this Note, deliver to the Holder in exchange for this Note a security of the Successor Entity evidenced by a written instrument substantially similar in form and substance to this Note which is convertible for a corresponding number of shares of capital stock of such Successor Entity (or its parent entity) equivalent to the shares of Common Stock acquirable and receivable upon conversion of this Note (without regard to any limitations on the conversion of this Note) prior to such Fundamental Transaction, and with a conversion price which applies the conversion price hereunder to such shares of capital stock (but taking into account the relative value of the shares of Common Stock pursuant to such Fundamental Transaction and the value of such shares of capital stock, such number of shares of capital stock and such conversion price being for the purpose of protecting the economic value of this Note immediately prior to the consummation of such Fundamental Transaction), and which is reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Holder. Upon the occurrence of any such Fundamental Transaction, the Successor Entity shall succeed to, and be substituted for (so that from and after the date of such Fundamental Transaction, the provisions of this Note and the other Transaction Documents referring to the “Company” shall refer instead to the Successor Entity), and may exercise every right and power of the Company and shall assume all of the obligations of the Company under this Note and the other Transaction Documents with the same effect as if such Successor Entity had been named as the Company herein. (b) Stock Dividends and Stock Splits. If the Company, at any time while this Note is outstanding: (i) pays a stock dividend or otherwise makes a distribution or distributions payable in shares of Common Stock on shares of Common Stock or any Common Stock Equivalents (which, for avoidance of doubt, shall not include any shares of Common Stock issued by the Company upon conversion of, or payment of interest on, the Notes), (ii) subdivides outstanding shares of Common Stock into a larger number of shares, (iii) combines (including by way of a reverse stock split) outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares or (iv) issues, in the event of a reclassification of shares of the Common Stock, any shares of capital stock of the Company, then the Fixed Price shall be multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding any treasury shares of the Company) outstanding immediately before such event, and of which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event. Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution and shall become
21 effective immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or reclassification. (c) Subsequent Equity Sales. If, at any time while this Note is outstanding, the Company or any Subsidiary, as applicable, sells or grants any option to purchase or sells or grants any right to reprice, or otherwise disposes of or issues (or announces any sale, grant or any option to purchase or other disposition), any Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents entitling any Person to acquire shares of Common Stock at an effective price per share that is lower than the then-current Fixed Price (such issuances, collectively, a “Dilutive Issuance”) (for the avoidance of doubt, if the holder of the Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents so issued shall at any time, whether by operation of purchase price adjustments, reset provisions, floating conversion, exercise or exchange prices or otherwise, or due to warrants, options or rights per share which are issued in connection with such issuance, be entitled to receive shares of Common Stock at an effective price per share that is lower than the then-current Fixed Price, such issuance shall be deemed to have occurred for less than the Fixed Price on such date of the Dilutive Issuance), then simultaneously with the consummation (or, if earlier, the announcement) of each Dilutive Issuance the Fixed Price shall be reduced to equal the lowest VWAP for the Common Stock during the five (5) Trading Days following the consummation or announcement (if earlier) of such Dilutive Issuance (such lowest VWAP, the “Base Fixed Price”); provided, however, that in no event shall the Fixed Price be reduced to an amount that is less than the Floor Price. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no adjustment will be made under this Section 5(c) in respect of an Exempt Issuance (as defined in the Purchase Agreement). If the Company enters into a Variable Rate Transaction, despite the prohibition set forth in the Purchase Agreement, the Company shall be deemed to have issued Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents at the lowest possible conversion price at which such securities may be converted or exercised. The Company shall notify the Holder in writing, no later than the Trading Day following the issuance of any Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents subject to this Section 5(c), indicating therein the applicable issuance price, or applicable reset price, exchange price, conversion price and other pricing terms (such notice, the “Dilutive Issuance Notice”). For purposes of clarification, whether or not the Company provides a Dilutive Issuance Notice pursuant to this Section 5(c), upon the occurrence of any Dilutive Issuance, subject to the Floor Price, the Holder is entitled to receive a number of Conversion Shares for a conversion under Section 4(c) based upon the Base Fixed Price on or after the date of such Dilutive Issuance, regardless of whether the Holder accurately refers to the Base Fixed Price in the applicable Conversion Notice. (d) Subsequent Rights Offerings. In addition to any adjustments pursuant to Section 5(a) above, if at any time the Company grants, issues or sells any Common Stock Equivalents or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property pro rata to the record holders of any class of shares of Common Stock (the “Purchase Rights”), then the Holder will be entitled to acquire, upon the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which the Holder could have acquired if the Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of this Note at the Fixed Price (without regard to any limitations on exercise hereof, including without limitation, the Beneficial Ownership Limitation) immediately before the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of shares of
22 Common Stock are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such Purchase Rights (provided, however, that, the Company shall deliver such Purchase Rights in kind, or at the Company’s election, the cash value thereof to the extent delivery in kind is impracticable and to the extent that the Holder’s right to participate in any such Purchase Right would result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation, then the Holder shall not be entitled to participate in such Purchase Right to such extent (or beneficial ownership of such shares of Common Stock as a result of such Purchase Right to such extent) and such Purchase Right to such extent shall be held in abeyance for the Holder until such time, if ever, as its right thereto would not result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation). The cash value of any Purchaser Rights shall be reasonably determined by the Board. In the event of a dispute between the Company and the Holder regarding such cash value of such Purchase Rights, such dispute shall be referred to a reputable investment bank mutually acceptable to Company and the Holder to determine such cash value and such decision of the investment shall be binding on the Company and the Holder. (e) Pro Rata Distributions. During such time as this Note is outstanding, if the Company shall declare or make any dividend or other distribution of its assets (or rights to acquire its assets) to holders of shares of Common Stock, by way of return of capital or otherwise (including, without limitation, any distribution of cash, stock or other securities, property or options by way of a dividend, spin off, reclassification, corporate rearrangement, scheme of arrangement or other similar transaction) (a “Distribution”), at any time after the issuance of this Note, then, in each such case, the Holder shall be entitled to participate in such Distribution to the same extent that the Holder would have participated therein if the Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of this Note (without regard to any limitations on conversion hereof, including without limitation, the Beneficial Ownership Limitation) immediately before the date of which a record is taken for such Distribution, or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of shares of Common Stock are to be determined for the participation in such Distribution (and the Company shall deliver such Distribution in kind, or at the Company’s election, the cash value thereof to the extent delivery in kind is impracticable, provided, however, that, to the extent that the Holder's right to participate in any such Distribution would result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation, then the Holder shall not be entitled to participate in such Distribution to such extent (and the portion of such Distribution shall be held in abeyance for the benefit of the Holder until such time, if ever, as its right thereto would not result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation). The cash value of any Distribution shall be reasonably determined by the Board. In the event of a dispute between the Company and the Holder regarding such cash value of such Distribution, such dispute shall be referred to a reputable investment bank mutually acceptable to Company and the Holder to determine such cash value and such decision of the investment shall be binding on the Company and the Holder. (f) Voluntary Adjustment by Company. The Company may at any time during the term of this Note, with the prior written consent of the Holder reduce the then current Fixed Price of each of the Notes to any amount and for any period of time deemed appropriate by the board of directors of the Company.

Each party hereto hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New York Courts for the adjudication of any dispute hereunder or in connection herewith or with any transaction contemplated hereby or discussed herein (including with respect to the enforcement of any of the Transaction Documents), and hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert in any suit, action or proceeding, any claim that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of such New York Courts, or such New York Courts are improper or inconvenient venue for such proceeding. Each party hereby irrevocably waives personal service of process and consents to process being served in any such suit, action or proceeding by mailing a copy thereof via registered or certified mail or overnight delivery (with evidence of delivery) to such party at the address in effect for notices to it under this Note and agrees that such service shall constitute good and sufficient service of process and notice thereof.

The failure of the Company or the Holder to insist upon strict adherence to any term of this Note on one or more occasions shall not be considered a waiver or deprive that party of the right thereafter to insist upon strict adherence to that term or any other term of this Note on any other occasion. Any waiver by the Company or the Holders must be in writing. Any provision of this Note may be waived by the Holders of at
32 least 50.1% of the outstanding principal amount of the Note, which waiver shall be binding on all of the Holders of the Note and their successors and assigns. Any provision of this Note may be amended by a written instrument executed by the Company and the Holders of at least 50.1% of the outstanding principal amount of the Note, which amendment shall be binding on all of the Holders of the Note and their successors and assigns. (f) Severability. If any provision of this Note is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the balance of this Note shall remain in effect, and if any provision is inapplicable to any Person or circumstance, it shall nevertheless remain applicable to all other Persons and circumstances. If it shall be found that any interest or other amount deemed interest due hereunder violates the applicable law governing usury, the applicable rate of interest due hereunder shall automatically be lowered to equal the maximum rate of interest permitted under applicable law. The Company covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it shall not at any time insist upon, plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage of, any stay, extension or usury law or other law which would prohibit or forgive the Company from paying all or any portion of the principal of or interest on this Note as contemplated herein, wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, or which may affect the covenants or the performance of this Note, and the Company (to the extent it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives all benefits or advantage of any such law, and covenants that it will not, by resort to any such law, hinder, delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Holder, but will suffer and permit the execution of every such as though no such law has been enacted.

The remedies provided in this Note shall be cumulative and in addition to all other remedies available under this Note and any of the other Transaction Documents at law or in equity (including a decree of specific performance and/or other injunctive relief), and nothing herein shall limit the Holder’s right to pursue actual and consequential damages for any failure by the Company to comply with the terms of this Note. The Company covenants to the Holder that there shall be no characterization concerning this instrument other than as expressly provided herein. Amounts set forth or provided for herein with respect to payments, conversion and the like (and the computation thereof) shall be the amounts to be received by the Holder and shall not, except as expressly provided herein, be subject to any other obligation of the Company (or the performance thereof). The Company acknowledges that a breach by it of its obligations hereunder will cause irreparable harm to the Holder and that the remedy at law for any such breach may be inadequate. The Company therefore agrees that, in the event of any such breach or threatened breach, the Holder shall be entitled, in addition to all other available remedies, to an injunction restraining any such breach or any such threatened breach, without the necessity of showing economic loss and without any bond or other security being required. The Company shall provide all information and documentation to the Holder that is requested by the Holder to enable the Holder to confirm the Company’s compliance with the terms and conditions of this Note. (h) Next Business Day. Whenever any payment or other obligation hereunder shall be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day.
33 (i) Headings. The headings contained herein are for convenience only, do not constitute a part of this Note and shall not be deemed to limit or affect any of the provisions hereof. (j) Secured Obligation. The obligations of the Company under this Note are secured by the Collateral pursuant to the Security Documents. Section 10. Disclosure. Upon receipt or delivery by the Company of any notice in accordance with the terms of this Note, unless the Company has in good faith determined that the matters relating to such notice do not constitute material, nonpublic information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries, the Company shall within two (2) Business Days after such receipt or delivery publicly disclose such material, nonpublic information on a Current Report on Form 8-K or otherwise. In the event that the Company believes that a notice contains material, non- public information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries, the Company so shall indicate to the Holder contemporaneously with delivery of such notice, and in the absence of any such indication, the Holder shall be allowed to presume that all matters relating to such notice do not constitute material, nonpublic information relating to the Company or its Subsidiaries. Section 11. Certain Tax Matters. All payments to be made by the Company under the this Note (whether in cash or on Common Stock) shall be made without any Tax Deduction (as defined below) unless a Tax Deduction is required by law. The Company shall promptly upon becoming aware that it must make a Tax Deduction (or that there is any change in the rate or the basis of a Tax Deduction) notify the Holder accordingly. Unless the Holder has complied with Section 2.2(a)(ii)(4) of the SPA, if a Tax Deduction is required by law to be made by the Company, the amount of the payment due from the Company under this Note shall be increased to an amount which (after making any Tax Deduction) leaves an amount equal to the payment which would have been due under this Note if no Tax Deduction had been required; provided, however, no such increase is required to the extent any holder changes its residency for tax purposes or assigns or transfers its rights and obligations pursuant to this Agreement and such action leads to the imposition of Tax Deduction on payment that would not have been imposed in the absence of such action or an increase in such liability above the liability that would have been imposed in the absence of such action. If the Company is required to make a Tax Deduction, it shall make that Tax Deduction and any payment required in connection with that Tax Deduction within the time allowed and in the minimum amount required by law. Within thirty (30) days of making either a Tax Deduction or any payment required in connection with that Tax Deduction, the Company shall deliver to the Holder evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Holder that the Tax Deduction has been made and that any appropriate payment has been paid to the relevant taxing authority. For greater certainty, (i) this Section 11 applies to all payments, whether in the form of cash, Common Stock or otherwise, made under this Note, and (ii) as long as the Holder has complied with Section 2.2(a)(ii)(4) of the SPA, the Company is obligated to indemnify the Holder pursuant to this Section 11 in the event that a Tax Deduction is required in respect of any payment to be made to the Holder under this Note and the company and/or its subsidiaries fail to comply with this Section 11. For purposes of this Section 11, "Tax" means any tax, levy, impost, duty or other charge or withholding of a similar nature (including any penalty or interest payable in connection with any failure to pay or any delay in paying any of the same) and "Tax Deduction" means any deduction or withholding for or on account of any Tax.
