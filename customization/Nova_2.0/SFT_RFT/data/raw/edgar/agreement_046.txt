Issuance
of Restricted Stock.
(a)
Issuance
of Restricted Stock to Holder
. The Company will issue the Restricted Stock to the Holder. The Company will update the Company’s
capitalization table to reflect the issuance of the Restricted Stock. The Shares will be subject to vesting in accordance with
Section
2
below.
(b)
Escrow
.
The Company shall issue the Restricted Stock either (i) in certificate form or (ii) in book entry form, registered in the name of Holder,
with legends, or notations, as applicable, referring to the terms, conditions and restrictions applicable to this Agreement. Any certificate(s)
for the Restricted Stock shall be deposited in escrow with the Secretary of the Company (or his/her designee) to be held in accordance
with the provisions of this paragraph. Each deposited certificate shall be accompanied by a duly executed Assignment Separate from Certificate
in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A. Any deposited certificates shall remain in escrow until such time as the certificates are to
be released or otherwise surrendered for cancellation as discussed below. All dividends whether in cash or in stock, if any, on the Restricted
Stock shall also be held in escrow and subject to the same vesting terms and conditions as the Shares and such dividends shall only be
paid to Holder upon vesting of the underlying shares of Restricted Stock. If and when Holder’s interest in the Restricted Stock
vests, the Company shall, as applicable, either remove the notations on any such shares of Restricted Stock issued in book entry form
or deliver to Holder a stock certificate representing a number of shares, equal to the number of shares of Restricted Stock with respect
to which have become vested.
(c)
Representations
and Warranties
. In connection with the receipt of the Restricted Stock, Holder represents and warrants to the Company that:
(i) The
shares pursuant to this Agreement shall be acquired for Holder’s own account and not with a view to, or the intention of, distribution
thereof in violation of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “
Securities Act
”) or any applicable state securities
laws, and the Restricted Stock will not be disposed of in contravention of the Securities Act or any applicable state securities laws;
(ii) Holder
is an officer of the Company, is sophisticated in financial matters and is able to evaluate the risks and benefits of the receipt of
the Restricted Stock;
(iii) Holder
is an “accredited investor” within the meaning of Rule 501 of Regulation D of the Securities and Exchange Commission, is
sophisticated in financial matters and is able to evaluate the risks and benefits of the receipt of the Restricted Stock;
(iv) Holder
is able to bear the economic risk of the Holder’s receipt of the Restricted Stock for an indefinite period of time because, among
other things, the Shares have not been registered under the Securities Act and, therefore, cannot be sold unless subsequently registered
under the Securities Act or an exemption from such registration is available;
(v) Holder
has had an opportunity to ask questions and receive answers concerning the terms and conditions of the Restricted Stock and has had full
access to such other information concerning the Company as Holder has requested;
(vi) this
Agreement and each of the other agreements contemplated hereby constitute the legal, valid and binding obligation of Holder, enforceable

to which Holder is subject;
(vii) Holder
has had the opportunity to consult Holder’s own tax counsel and financial advisor as to the U.S. federal, state, local and foreign
tax consequences of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Company Group have not made any representations regarding
such tax consequences or benefits upon which Holder has relied; and
(viii) Holder
is a resident of the State set forth in Holder’s address for notices in

2.
Vesting
of the Restricted Stock
.
(a) The
Restricted Stock shall be subject to vesting in the manner specified in Recital C and this
Section 2
. The Restricted Stock shall
be initially unvested and shall vest, as and when the Holder has successfully achieved the Corporate Milestones as defined in Recital
C to this Agreement.
(b) In
the event that the Holder voluntarily terminates his services as a director, officer or employee of the Company, then all vesting shall
cease, and the Holder will surrender, without consideration, the portion of the Restricted Stock that remains unvested on the date of
separation of service.
(c) In
the event that the Holder’s service as a director, officer or employee of the Company is terminated by the Company without “Cause”,
all shares of the Restricted Stock shall immediately become vested in full. “
Cause
” for purposes of this Agreement
shall mean (i) “Cause” as defined in any employment agreement between the Company and the Holder, (ii) the material breach
by the Holder of any of the terms of any employment or service agreement with the Company which is not cured within 15 days written notice
to the Holder identifying the nature of the failure; (iii) gross negligence, a material breach by the Holder of his fiduciary duties
or the commission by the Holder of an act of fraud or embezzlement or his misappropriation of any money or other assets or property (whether
tangible or intangible) of the Company; (iv) the Holder’s engagement in conduct resulting in a material injury to the business,
financial condition or operations of the Company; or (v) the conviction of, or plea of guilty or nolo contendere by, the Holder of a
felony or any crime or civil violation involving moral turpitude.
(d) In
the event of a “Change on Control” of the Company prior to the anniversary of this Agreement, then all shares of the Restricted
Stock shall immediately become vested in full. For purposes of this Agreement, “
Change in Control
” means (i) any merger
or consolidation in which the Company shall not be the surviving entity (or survives only as a subsidiary of another entity whose stockholders
did not own all or substantially all of the Common Stock in substantially the same proportions as immediately prior to such transaction),
(ii) the sale of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets to any other person or entity (other than a wholly-owned subsidiary),
(iii) the acquisition of beneficial ownership of a controlling interest (including, without limitation, power to vote) in the outstanding
shares of Common Stock by any person or entity (including a “group” as defined by or under Section 13(d)(3) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). A transaction shall not constitute a Change in Control if its sole purpose is to change the state
of the Company’s incorporation or to create a holding company that will be owned in substantially the same proportions by the persons
who held the Company’s securities immediately before such transactions.

3.
Tax
Matters.
(a)
Code
Section 83(b) Election
. Holder represents and warrants that Holder understands the Federal, state and local income tax consequences
of the granting of this Restricted Stock. Holder may voluntarily elect to be taxed at the time the Restricted Stock is acquired to the
extent that the fair market value of the Restricted Stock exceeds the amount of consideration paid by Holder (if any) for such Restricted
Stock at that time rather than when such Restricted Stock ceases to be subject to such forfeiture restrictions, by filing an election
under Section 83(b) of the Code with the Internal Revenue Service within thirty (30) days after the issuance of the Restricted Stock.
A form for making this election is attached as Exhibit B hereto. Failure to make this filing within the thirty (30) day period may result
in the recognition of ordinary income by Holder as the forfeiture restrictions lapse.
HOLDER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT IS HOLDER’S
SOLE RESPONSIBILITY, AND NOT THE COMPANY’S, TO FILE A TIMELY ELECTION UNDER CODE SECTION 83(b), EVEN IF HOLDER REQUESTS THE COMPANY
OR ITS REPRESENTATIVES TO MAKE THIS FILING ON HOLDER S BEHALF. MOREOVER, HOLDER IS RELYING SOLELY ON HOLDER’S OWN ADVISORS WITH
RESPECT TO THE DECISION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT TO FILE A CODE SECTION 83(b) ELECTION.
(b)
Code
Section 409A
.
(i) The
intent of the parties is that payments and benefits under this Agreement comply with or otherwise be exempt from Code Section 409A and
the regulations and guidance promulgated thereunder (collectively, “
Code Section 409A
”) and, accordingly, to
the maximum extent permitted, this Agreement shall be interpreted to be either exempt from or in compliance therewith. In no event whatsoever
shall the Company be liable for any additional tax, interest or penalty that may be imposed on the Holder by Code Section 409A or damages
for failing to comply with Code Section 409A.
(ii) Notwithstanding
any other provision to the contrary, in no event shall any payment under this Agreement that constitutes “deferred compensation”
for purposes of Code Section 409A be subject to offset by any other amount unless otherwise permitted by Code Section 409A.

Transfers
of Restricted Stock
.
(a)
Transfers
in Violation of Agreement
. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in no event may any unvested shares
of Restricted Stock be sold or transferred in any manner. The Holder may designate a beneficiary who will receive any outstanding vested
shares of Restricted Stock in the event of the Holder’s death. Regardless of any marital property settlement agreement, the Company
is not obligated to recognize the Holder’s spouse’s interest in the Restricted Stock in any way. Any transfer or attempted
transfer of any portion of the Restricted Stock in violation of any provision of this Agreement shall be void, and the Company shall
not record such transfer on its books or treat any purported transferee of such Restricted Stock as the owner of such shares of Restricted
Stock for any purpose.
(b)
Legends
.
All certificates representing the Shares issued under this Award may, where applicable, have endorsed thereon the following legends and
any other legends the Company determines appropriate:
“THE
SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER AND OPTIONS TO PURCHASE SUCH SHARES SET FORTH
IN AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND THE REGISTERED HOLDER, OR HIS OR HER PREDECESSOR IN INTEREST. A COPY OF SUCH AGREEMENT IS ON
FILE AT THE PRINCIPAL OFFICE OF THE COMPANY AND WILL BE FURNISHED UPON WRITTEN REQUEST TO THE SECRETARY OF THE COMPANY BY THE HOLDER
OF RECORD OF THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE.”
“THE
SHARES REPRESENTED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, AND MAY NOT BE SOLD, PLEDGED, OR OTHERWISE
TRANSFERRED WITHOUT AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION THEREOF UNDER SUCH ACT OR AN OPINION OF COUNSEL, SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY AND ITS COUNSEL,
THAT SUCH REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED.”
6.

(a)
The
 Holder shall have the right on any calendar day, at any time, on or following Issue Date,
 to convert all or any portion of the then outstanding Restricted Stock into fully paid and
 non-assessable shares of Common Stock, as such Common Stock exists on the Issue Date, or
 any shares of capital stock or other securities of the Borrower into which such Common Stock
 shall hereafter be changed or reclassified, at the Conversion Price (as defined below) determined
 as provided herein (a “Conversion”), by submitting to the Borrower or Borrower’s
 transfer agent a Notice of Conversion (as defined in this Note) by facsimile, e-mail or other
 reasonable means of communication dispatched on the date of conversion prior to 11:59 p.m.
