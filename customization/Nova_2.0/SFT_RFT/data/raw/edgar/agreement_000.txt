In the event of a Condemnation of all or substantially all of any of the Properties, and if as a result of such Condemnation: (i) access to the Property to and from the publicly dedicated roads adjacent to the Property as of the Effective Date is permanently and materially impaired such that Lessee no longer has access to such dedicated road; (ii) there is insufficient parking to operate the Property as a Permitted
STORE/ Ascent (Synalloy) Seventh Amended and Restated Master Lease File No. 7210/02-475 19 4936-7403-8122.2 Facility under applicable Laws; or (iii) the Condemnation includes a portion of the building such that the remaining portion is unsuitable for use as a Permitted Facility, as determined by Lessee in the exercise of good faith business judgment (and Lessee provides to Lessor an officer’s certificate executed by an officer of Lessee certifying to the same) (each such event, a “Total Condemnation”), then, in such event: (a) Termination of Lease. On the date of the Total Condemnation, all obligations of either party hereunder with respect to the applicable Property shall cease and the Base Annual Rental shall be reduced as set forth in Section 11.03(c) below; provided, however, that Lessee’s obligations to the Indemnified Parties under any indemnification provisions of this Lease with respect to such Property and Lessee’s obligation to pay Rental and all other Monetary Obligations (whether payable to Lessor or a third party) accruing under this Lease with respect to such Property prior to the date of termination shall survive such termination. If the date of such Total Condemnation is other than the first day of a month, the Base Monthly Rental for the month in which such Total Condemnation occurs shall be apportioned based on the date of the Total Condemnation. (b) Net Award. Subject to Section 11.07 below, Lessor shall be entitled to receive the entire Net Award in connection with a Total Condemnation without deduction for any estate vested in Lessee by this Lease, and Lessee hereby expressly assigns to Lessor all of its right, title and interest in and to every such Net Award and agrees that Lessee shall not be entitled to any Net Award or other payment for the value of Lessee’s leasehold interest in this Lease. Section 11.03. Partial Condemnation or Casualty. In the event of a Condemnation which is not a Total Condemnation (each such event, a “Partial Condemnation”), or in the event of a Casualty: (a) Net Awards. All Net Awards shall be paid to Lessor. (b) Continuance of Lease. This Lease shall continue in full force and effect upon the following terms: (i) All Rental and other Monetary Obligations due under this Lease shall continue unabated. (ii) Lessee shall promptly commence and diligently prosecute restoration of such Property to the same condition, as nearly as practicable, as prior to such Partial Condemnation or Casualty as approved by Lessor. Subject to the terms and provisions of the Mortgages and upon the written request of Lessee (accompanied by evidence reasonably satisfactory to Lessor that such amount has been paid or is due and payable and is properly part of such costs, and that Lessee has complied with the terms of Section 7.02 in connection with the restoration), Lessor shall promptly make available in installments, subject to reasonable conditions for disbursement imposed by Lessor, an amount up to but not exceeding the amount of any Net Award received by Lessor with respect to such Partial Condemnation or Casualty. Prior to the disbursement of any portion of the Net Award with respect to a Casualty, Lessee shall provide evidence
STORE/ Ascent (Synalloy) Seventh Amended and Restated Master Lease File No. 7210/02-475 20 4936-7403-8122.2 reasonably satisfactory to Lessor of the payment of restoration expenses by Lessee up to the amount of the insurance deductible applicable to such Casualty. Lessor shall be entitled to keep any portion of the Net Award which may be in excess of the cost of restoration, and Lessee shall bear all additional Costs of such restoration in excess of the Net Award. (c) Right to Termination. Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary contained in this Article XI, in the event that, as a result of a Casualty in the last year of the Lease Term, Lessee shall reasonably estimate in the exercise of good faith business judgment that the applicable Property cannot be used for the same purpose and substantially with the same utility as before such Casualty (and Lessee provides to Lessor an officer's certificate executed by an officer of Lessee certifying to the same), then, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this subsection (c), Lessee shall have the right, exercisable by written notice given to Lessor no later than thirty (30) days following such Casualty, to terminate this Lease with respect to such damaged Property (and in connection with such termination, the Base Annual Rental shall be reduced as set forth in Section 11.03() below). If Lessee elects to terminate, this Lease shall terminate with respect to such Property as of the last day of the month during which such thirty (30) day period expired. Lessee shall vacate and surrender such Property by such termination date, in accordance with the provisions of this Lease, and ail obligations of either party hereunder with respect to such Property shall cease as of the date of termination; provided, however, Lessee's obligations to the Indemnified Parties under any indemnification provisions of this Lease with respect to such Property and Lessee's obligations to pay Rental and all other Monetary Obligations (whether payable to Lessor or a third party) accruing under this Lease with respect to such Property prior to the date of termination shall survive such termination subject to, and in accordance with, the terms hereof. In such event, Lessor may retain all Net Awards related to the Casualty, and Lessee shall immediately pay Lessor an amount equal to the insurance deductible applicable to any Casualty. (d) Rental. Upon removal of a Property pursuant to Section 11.02 or Section 11.03, the Base Annual Rental shall be reduced by an amount equal to the Lease Rate multiplied by the Net Award. Section 11.04. Temporary Taking. In the event of a Condemnation of all or any part of any Property for a temporary use (a “Temporary Taking”), this Lease shall remain in full force and effect without any reduction of Base Annual Rental, Additional Rental or any other Monetary Obligation payable hereunder. Except as provided below, Lessee shall be entitled to the entire Net Award for a Temporary Taking, unless the period of occupation and use by the condemning authorities shall extend beyond the date of expiration of this Lease, in which event the Net Award made for such Temporary Taking shall be apportioned between Lessor and Lessee as of the date of such expiration. At the termination of any such Temporary Taking, Lessee will, at its own cost and expense and pursuant to the provisions of Section 7.02, promptly commence and complete restoration of such Property. Section 11.05. Adjustment of Losses. Any loss under any property damage insurance required to be maintained by Lessee shall be adjusted by Lessor and Lessee. Any Net Award relating to a Total Condemnation or a Partial Condemnation shall be adjusted by Lessor or, at Lessor’s election, Lessee. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provisions
STORE/ Ascent (Synalloy) Seventh Amended and Restated Master Lease File No. 7210/02-475 21 4936-7403-8122.2 of this Section 11.05 to the contrary, if at the time of any Condemnation or any Casualty or at any time thereafter an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, Lessor is hereby authorized and empowered but shall not be obligated, in the name and on behalf of Lessee and otherwise, to file and prosecute Lessee’s claim, if any, for a Net Award on account of such Condemnation or such Casualty and to collect such Net Award and apply the same to the curing of such Event of Default and any other then existing Event of Default under this Lease and/or to the payment of any amounts owed by Lessee to Lessor under this Lease, in such order, priority and proportions as Lessor in its discretion shall deem proper. Section 11.06. Lessee Obligation in Event of Casualty. During all periods of time following a Casualty, Lessee shall take reasonable steps to ensure that the affected Property is secure and does not pose any risk of harm to any adjoining property and Persons (including owners or occupants of such adjoining property). Section 11.07. Lessee Awards and Payments. Notwithstanding any provision contained in this Article XI, Lessee shall be entitled to claim and receive any award or payment from the condemning authority expressly granted for the taking of any personal property owned by Lessee, any insurance proceeds with respect to any personal property owned by Lessee, the interruption of its business and moving expenses (subject, however, to the provisions of Section 6.03(a)(iv) above), but only if such claim or award does not adversely affect or interfere with the prosecution of Lessor’s claim for the Condemnation or Casualty, or otherwise reduce the amount recoverable by Lessor for the Condemnation or Casualty. ARTICLE XII DEFAULT, CONDITIONAL LIMITATIONS, REMEDIES AND MEASURE OF DAMAGES Section 12.01. Event of Default. Each of the following shall be an event of default by Lessee under this Lease (each, an “Event of Default”): (a) if any representation or warranty of Lessee set forth in this Lease is false in any material respect when made, or if Lessee renders any materially false statement or account when made; (b) if any Rental or other Monetary Obligation due under this Lease is not paid when due if such failure continues for more than three (3) Business Days after written notice from Lessor; provided, however, Lessor shall only be required to provide such notice twice in any twelve (12) month period; provided, however, any delay in the payment of Rental as a result of a technical error in the wiring and/or automated clearinghouse process shall not constitute an Event of Default hereunder so long as the same is corrected within one (1) Business Day of the date Lessee receives notice thereof; (c) if Lessee fails to pay, prior to delinquency, any taxes, assessments or other charges the failure of which to pay will result in the imposition of a lien against any of the Properties; (d) if Lessee vacates or abandons any Property;
STORE/ Ascent (Synalloy) Seventh Amended and Restated Master Lease File No. 7210/02-475 22 4936-7403-8122.2 (e) if there is an Insolvency Event affecting Lessee; (f) if Lessee fails to observe or perform any of the other covenants, conditions or obligations of Lessee in this Lease; provided, however, if any such failure does not involve the payment of any Monetary Obligation, is not willful or intentional, does not place any Property or any rights or property of Lessor in immediate jeopardy, and is within the reasonable power of Lessee to promptly cure, all as determined by Lessor in its reasonable discretion, then such failure shall not constitute an Event of Default hereunder, unless otherwise expressly provided herein, unless and until Lessor shall have given Lessee notice thereof and a period of thirty (30) days shall have elapsed, during which period Lessee may correct or cure such failure, upon failure of which an Event of Default shall be deemed to have occurred hereunder without further notice or demand of any kind being required. If such failure cannot reasonably be cured within such thirty (30) day period, as determined by Lessor in its reasonable discretion, and Lessee is diligently pursuing a cure of such failure, then Lessee shall have a reasonable period to cure such failure beyond such thirty (30)-day period, which shall in no event exceed ninety (90) days after receiving notice of such failure from Lessor. If Lessee shall fail to correct or cure such failure within such ninety (90)-day period, an Event of Default shall be deemed to have occurred hereunder without further notice or demand of any kind being required; (g) if a final, nonappealable judgment is rendered by a court against Lessee which has a Material Adverse Effect, and is not discharged or provision made for such discharge within ninety (90) days from the date of entry thereof; (h) if Lessee shall be liquidated or dissolved or shall begin proceedings towards its liquidation or dissolution; (i) if the estate or interest of Lessee in any of the Properties shall be levied upon or attached in any proceeding and such estate or interest is about to be sold or transferred or such process shall not be vacated or discharged within ninety (90) days after it is made; or (j) if there is an “Event of Default” or other breach or default by Lessee under any of the other Transaction Documents or any Other Agreement , after the passage of all applicable notice and cure or grace periods; provided, however, in the event that this Lease has been the subject of a Securitization and any Other Agreement has not been the subject of the same Securitization or any series relating to such Securitization, an “Event of Default” under such Other Agreement shall not constitute an Event of Default under this Lease. Section 12.02. Remedies. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, with or without notice or demand, except as otherwise expressly provided herein or such other notice as may be required by statute and cannot be waived by Lessee, Lessor shall be entitled to exercise, at its option, concurrently, successively, or in any combination, all remedies available at Law or in equity, including, without limitation, any one or more of the following:
STORE/ Ascent (Synalloy) Seventh Amended and Restated Master Lease File No. 7210/02-475 23 4936-7403-8122.2 (a) to terminate this Lease, whereupon Lessee’s right to possession of the Properties shall cease and this Lease, except as to Lessee’s liability, shall be terminated; (b) to the extent not prohibited by applicable Law, to (i) re-enter and take possession of the Properties (or any part thereof), any or all personal property or fixtures of Lessee upon the Properties and, to the extent permissible, permits and other rights or privileges of Lessee pertaining to the use and operation of the Properties, and (ii) expel Lessee and those claiming under or through Lessee, without being deemed guilty in any manner of trespass or becoming liable for any loss or damage resulting therefrom, without resort to legal or judicial process, procedure or action. No notice from Lessor hereunder or under a forcible entry and detainer statute or similar Law shall constitute an election by Lessor to terminate this Lease unless such notice specifically so states. If Lessee shall, after default, voluntarily give up possession of the Properties to Lessor, deliver to Lessor or its agents the keys to the Properties, or both, such actions shall be deemed to be in compliance with Lessor’s rights and the acceptance thereof by Lessor or its agents shall not be deemed to constitute a termination of the Lease. Lessor reserves the right following any re-entry and/or reletting to exercise its right to terminate this Lease by giving Lessee written notice thereof, in which event this Lease will terminate; (c) to relet the Properties or any part thereof for such term or terms (including a term which extends beyond the original Lease Term), at such rentals and upon such other terms as Lessor, in its sole discretion, may determine, with all proceeds received from such reletting being applied to the Rental and other Monetary Obligations due from Lessee in such order as Lessor may, in its sole discretion, determine, which other Monetary Obligations include, without limitation, all reasonable and actual repossession costs, brokerage commissions, attorneys’ fees and expenses, alteration, remodeling and repair costs and expenses of preparing for such reletting. Except to the extent required by applicable Law, Lessor shall have no obligation to relet the Properties or any part thereof and shall in no event be liable for refusal or failure to relet the Properties or any part thereof, or, in the event of any such reletting, for refusal or failure to collect any rent due upon such reletting, and no such refusal or failure shall operate to relieve Lessee of any liability under this Lease or otherwise to affect any such liability. Lessor reserves the right following any re-entry and/or reletting to exercise its right to terminate this Lease by giving Lessee written notice thereof, in which event this Lease will terminate as specified in said notice; (d) to recover from Lessee all Costs paid or incurred by Lessor as a result of such breach, regardless of whether or not legal proceedings are actually commenced; (e) to immediately or at any time thereafter, and with or without notice, at Lessor’s sole option but without any obligation to do so, correct such breach or default and charge Lessee all Costs incurred by Lessor therein. Any sum or sums so paid by Lessor, together with interest at the Default Rate, shall be deemed to be Additional Rental hereunder and shall be immediately due from Lessee to Lessor. Any such acts by Lessor in correcting Lessee’s breaches or defaults hereunder shall not be deemed to cure said breaches or defaults or constitute any waiver of Lessor’s right to exercise any or all remedies set forth herein;
STORE/ Ascent (Synalloy) Seventh Amended and Restated Master Lease File No. 7210/02-475 24 4936-7403-8122.2 (f) to immediately or at any time thereafter, and with or without notice, except as required herein, set off any money of Lessee held by Lessor under this Lease or any other Transaction Document or any Other Agreement against any sum owing by Lessee hereunder; (g) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing or limiting in any way the rights of Lessor under this Lease or otherwise under applicable Laws, at any time after the occurrence, and during the continuance, of an Event of Default, Lessor shall be entitled to apply for and seek the appointment of a receiver under and subject to applicable Law by a court of competent jurisdiction (by ex parte motion for appointment without notice) in any action taken by Lessor to enforce its rights and remedies hereunder in order to protect and preserve Lessor’s interest under this Lease or in the Properties and the Personalty; and/or (h) to seek any equitable relief available to Lessor, including, without limitation, the right of specific performance. Section 12.03. Cumulative Remedies. All powers and remedies given by Section 12.02 to Lessor, subject to applicable Law, shall be cumulative and not exclusive of one another or of any other right or remedy or of any other powers and remedies available to Lessor under this Lease, by judicial proceedings or otherwise, to enforce the performance or observance of the covenants and agreements of Lessee contained in this Lease, and no delay or omission of Lessor to exercise any right or power accruing upon the occurrence of any Event of Default shall impair any other or subsequent Event of Default or impair any rights or remedies consequent thereto. Every power and remedy given by this Section or by Law to Lessor may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be deemed expedient, by Lessor, subject at all times to Lessor’s right in its sole judgment to discontinue any work commenced by Lessor or change any course of action undertaken by Lessor. Section 12.04. Lessee Waiver. Lessee hereby expressly waives, for itself and all Persons claiming by, through and under Lessee, including creditors of all kinds, (a) any right and privilege which Lessee has under any present or future Legal Requirements to redeem the Properties or to have a continuance of this Lease for the Lease Term after termination of Lessee’s right of occupancy by order or judgment of any court or by any legal process or writ, or under the terms of this Lease; (b) the benefits of any present or future Legal Requirement that exempts property from liability for debt or for distress for rent; (c) any present or future Legal Requirement relating to notice or delay in levy of execution in case of eviction of a tenant for nonpayment of rent; and (d) any benefits and lien rights which may arise pursuant to any present or future Legal Requirement. ARTICLE XIII MORTGAGE, SUBORDINATION AND ATTORNMENT Section 13.01. No Liens. Lessor’s interest in this Lease and/or the Properties shall not be subordinate to any liens or encumbrances placed upon the Properties by or resulting from any act of Lessee, and nothing herein contained shall be construed to require such subordination by Lessor. NOTICE IS HEREBY GIVEN THAT LESSEE IS NOT AUTHORIZED TO PLACE OR ALLOW TO BE PLACED ANY LIEN, MORTGAGE, DEED OF TRUST, DEED
STORE/ Ascent (Synalloy) Seventh Amended and Restated Master Lease File No. 7210/02-475 25 4936-7403-8122.2 TO SECURE DEBT, SECURITY INTEREST OR ENCUMBRANCE OF ANY KIND UPON ALL OR ANY PART OF THE PROPERTIES OR LESSEE’S LEASEHOLD INTEREST THEREIN, AND ANY SUCH PURPORTED TRANSACTION SHALL BE VOID. Section 13.02. Subordination. This Lease at all times shall automatically be subordinate to the lien of any and all ground leases and Mortgages now or hereafter placed upon any of the Properties by Lessor, and Lessee covenants and agrees to execute and deliver, upon demand, such further instruments subordinating this Lease to the lien of any or all such ground leases and Mortgages as shall be desired by Lessor, or any present or proposed mortgagees under trust deeds, upon the condition that Lessee shall have the right to remain in possession of the Properties under the terms of this Lease, notwithstanding any default in any or all such ground leases or Mortgages, or after the foreclosure of any such Mortgages, so long as no Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing. Section 13.03. Attornment. In the event any purchaser or assignee of any Lender at a foreclosure sale acquires title to any of the Properties, or in the event that any Lender or any purchaser or assignee otherwise succeeds to the rights of Lessor as landlord under this Lease, Lessee shall attorn to Lender or such purchaser or assignee, as the case may be (a “Successor Lessor”), and recognize the Successor Lessor as lessor under this Lease as long as Successor Lessor recognizes Lessee’s rights hereunder and does not disturb Lessee, and, subject to the provisions of this Article XIII, this Lease shall continue in full force and effect as a direct lease between the Successor Lessor and Lessee, provided that the Successor Lessor shall only be liable for any obligations of Lessor under this Lease which accrue after the date that such Successor Lessor acquires title. The foregoing provision shall be self-operative and effective without the execution of any further instruments. Section 13.04. Execution of Additional Documents. Although the provisions in this Article XIII shall be self-operative and no future instrument of subordination shall be required, upon request by Lessor, Lessee shall execute and deliver such additional reasonable instruments as may be reasonably required for such purposes. Section 13.05. Notice to Lender. Lessee shall give written notice to any Lender having a recorded lien upon any of the Properties or any part thereof of which Lessee has been notified of any breach or default by Lessor of any of its obligations under this Lease and give such Lender at least sixty (60) days beyond any notice period to which Lessor might be entitled to cure such default before Lessee may exercise any remedy with respect thereto. ARTICLE XIV ASSIGNMENT Section 14.01. Assignment by Lessor. As a material inducement to Lessor’s willingness to enter into the transactions contemplated by this Lease (the “Transaction”) and the other Transaction Documents, Lessee hereby agrees that Lessor may, from time to time and at any time and without the consent of Lessee, engage in all or any combination of the following, or enter into agreements in connection with any of the following or in accordance with requirements that may be imposed by applicable securities, tax or other Laws: (a) the sale, assignment, grant, conveyance, transfer, financing, re-financing, purchase or re-acquisition of all, less than all or any portion of the Properties, this Lease or any other Transaction Document,
STORE/ Ascent (Synalloy) Seventh Amended and Restated Master Lease File No. 7210/02-475 26 4936-7403-8122.2 Lessor’s right, title and interest in this Lease or any other Transaction Document, the servicing rights with respect to any of the foregoing, or participations in any of the foregoing; or (b) a Securitization and related transactions. Without in any way limiting the foregoing, the parties acknowledge and agree that Lessor, in its sole discretion, may assign this Lease or any interest herein to another Person in order to maintain Lessor’s or any of its Affiliates’ status as a REIT. In the event of any such sale or assignment other than a security assignment, Lessee shall attorn to such purchaser or assignee (so long as Lessor and such purchaser or assignee notify Lessee in writing of such transfer and such purchaser or assignee expressly assumes in writing the obligations of Lessor hereunder from and after the date of such assignment). At the request of Lessor, Lessee will execute such documents confirming the sale, assignment or other transfer and such other agreements as Lessor may reasonably request, provided that the same do not increase the liabilities and obligations of Lessee hereunder and include Successor Lessor’s express assumption of all Lessor’s obligations hereunder. Lessor shall be relieved, from and after the date of such transfer or conveyance, of liability for the performance of any obligation of Lessor contained herein, except for obligations or liabilities accrued prior to such assignment or sale. Section 14.02. No Assignment by Lessee. (a) Lessee acknowledges that Lessor has relied both on the business experience and creditworthiness of Lessee and upon the particular purposes for which Lessee intends to use the Properties in entering into this Lease. Subject to Section 14.02(b), Lessee shall not assign, transfer, convey, pledge or mortgage this Lease or any interest herein or any interest in Lessee, whether by operation of Law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of Lessor, which may not be unreasonably conditioned, delayed or withheld. At the time of any assignment of this Lease which is approved by Lessor, the assignee shall assume all of the obligations of Lessee under this Lease pursuant to a written assumption agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Lessor. Such assignment of this Lease pursuant to this Section 14.02 shall not relieve Lessee of its obligations respecting this Lease unless otherwise agreed to by Lessor, which shall not be unreasonably conditioned, delayed or withheld. Any assignment, transfer, conveyance, pledge or mortgage in violation of this Section 14.02 shall be voidable at the sole option of Lessor. Any consent to an assignment given by Lessor hereunder shall not be deemed a consent to any subsequent assignment. Lessor shall review and provide approval or reasons for withholding approval of an assignment within fifteen (15) days of Lessee’s request for approval. (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 14.02(a) above and provided that no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and provided further that any assignee agrees to assume all of Lessee's obligations under this Lease and reaffirms all the representations and warranties contained herein, a Lessee entity shall have the right to assign or otherwise transfer its interest in, to and under this Lease without Lessor's consent to (i) an Affiliate of Lessee , or (ii) any entity which purchases or otherwise acquires all or substantially all of the assets or equity interest of such Lessee entity in a bona fide sale for fair market value. In no event shall Lessee shall be released from liability under this Lease without the prior written consent of Lessor.
STORE/ Ascent (Synalloy) Seventh Amended and Restated Master Lease File No. 7210/02-475 27 4936-7403-8122.2 Section 14.03. No Sale of Assets. Without the prior written consent of Lessor, Lessee shall not sell all or substantially all of Lessee’s assets such that Lessee can no longer operate its business at the Properties, except in connection with an assumption of this Lease pursuant to Section 14.02(b) above. Any sale of Lessee’s assets in violation of this Section 14.03, shall be voidable at the sole option of Lessor. Any consent to a sale of Lessee’s assets given by Lessor hereunder shall not be deemed a consent to any subsequent sale of Lessee’s assets. Section 14.04. Subletting. Provided no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, Lessee shall have the right to sublease any or all of the Properties; provided, however, (i) the term of any such sublease shall not extend beyond the Lease Term; (ii) the sublease shall be for no use other than a Permitted Facility; (iii) the sublease shall be subject and subordinate to this Lease and shall not contain any terms inconsistent with this Lease; (iv) Lessee shall at all times remain fully and primarily liable under this Lease; (v) the rent due under such sublease shall be fixed rent and shall not be based on the net profits of the sublessee; and (vI) the sublease is approved by Lessor, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed (each, a “Sublease”). As security for the payment and performance by Lessee of its obligations under this Lease, Lessee hereby assigns, transfers, sets over and grants to Lessor, a security interest in any and all of Lessee’s right, title and interest, powers, privileges and other benefits as landlord under the Subleases, including, without limitation: (i) rent and proceeds thereof; (ii) the right to enter upon, take possession of and use any and all property subleased or granted by Lessee under the Subleases; (iii) the right to make all waivers and agreements, to give all notices, consents and releases, to take all action upon the happening of any default giving rise to a right in favor of Lessee under the Subleases; and (iv) the right to do any and all other things whatsoever which Lessee is or may become entitled to do under the Subleases. Upon the occurrence of and during the continuance of an Event of Default hereunder, Lessee agrees that, at the option of Lessor and in addition to such other rights and remedies as may be afforded to Lessor under this Lease, Lessor shall have the right, without giving notice to or obtaining the consent of Lessee, to exercise, enforce or avail itself of any of the rights, powers, privileges, authorizations or benefits assigned and transferred to Lessor pursuant to this Section 14.04, including, without limitation, the right to collect all amounts due under the Subleases. From and after the occurrence of an Event of Default, Lessee does hereby irrevocably appoint Lessor as Lessee’s true and lawful attorney, with full power (in the name of Lessee or otherwise) to ask, require, demand, receive and give acquittance for every payment under or arising out of the Subleases to which Lessee is or may become entitled. Lessee declares that this appointment is coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable by Lessee. Lessee further agrees to execute any and all other instruments deemed reasonably necessary by Lessor to further the intent of the foregoing assignment and to vest Lessor in the Subleases. Notwithstanding any provision contained in this Section 14.04, (i) Lessor shall not be obligated to perform or discharge any obligation, duty or liability under the Subleases by reason of the foregoing assignment; and (ii) Lessor shall not be liable or responsible for, and Lessee agrees to indemnify and hold Lessor harmless from and against any liability, loss, cost or damage, claim or demand against Lessor arising, directly or indirectly, from or related to the Subleases.

STORE/ Ascent (Synalloy) Seventh Amended and Restated Master Lease File No. 7210/02-475 29 4936-7403-8122.2 bona fide third party offer to Lessee (“Third Party Offer”). Within fifteen (15) days of Lessee’s receipt of such Third Party Offer from Lessor, and a written statement of Lessor’s desire to sell the Property in accordance with such Third Party Offer, Lessee shall have the right to deliver an offer to Lessor (“Purchase Offer”) to purchase Lessor’s interest in any such Property for the amount of the bona fide third party offer to purchase such Property (the “Subject Purchase Price”). Lessee shall complete such purchase, subject to the satisfaction of each of the terms and conditions set forth in Section 16.02 below. Section 16.02. Conditions Precedent.

Section 16.03. Costs. Lessee shall be solely responsible for the payment of all Costs resulting from any proposed purchase pursuant to this Article XVI, regardless of whether the purchase is consummated, including, without limitation, to the extent applicable, the cost of title insurance and endorsements, including, survey charges, stamp taxes, mortgage taxes, transfer taxes and fees, escrow and recording fees, taxes imposed on Lessor as a result of such purchase, the attorneys’ fees of Lessee and the reasonable attorneys’ fees and expenses of counsel to Lessor. Section 16.04. Termination of Right. NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY, LESSEE’S RIGHTS UNDER THIS ARTICLE XVI SHALL TERMINATE AND BE NULL AND VOID AND OF NO FURTHER FORCE AND EFFECT IF (i) LESSEE FAILS TO EXERCISE THE RIGHT GRANTED PURSUANT TO THIS ARTICLE, AND THE SALE TO THE THIRD PARTY PURCHASER IS CONSUMMATED; (ii) THIS LEASE TERMINATES OR THE LEASE TERM EXPIRES; OR (iii) THE PROPERTY IS SOLD OR TRANSFERRED PURSUANT
STORE/ Ascent (Synalloy) Seventh Amended and Restated Master Lease File No. 7210/02-475 30 4936-7403-8122.2 TO THE EXERCISE OF A PRIVATE POWER OF SALE OR JUDICIAL FORECLOSURE OR ACCEPTANCE OF A DEED IN LIEU THEREOF. IN ANY SUCH EVENT, LESSEE SHALL EXECUTE A QUITCLAIM DEED AND SUCH OTHER DOCUMENTS AS LESSOR SHALL REASONABLY REQUEST EVIDENCING THE TERMINATION OF ITS RIGHT UNDER THIS ARTICLE XVI. Section 16.05. Attornment. If Lessee does not deliver its Purchase Offer to purchase the Property and the Property is transferred to a third party purchaser, Lessee will attorn to any third party purchaser as Lessor so long as such third party purchaser and Lessor notify Lessee in writing of such transfer. At the request of Lessor, Lessee will execute such documents confirming the agreement referred to above and such other agreements as Lessor may reasonably request, provided that such agreements do not increase the liabilities and obligations of Lessee hereunder.

The provisions of this Article XVI shall not apply to or prohibit (i) any mortgages or other hypothecation of Lessor’s interest in the Property; (ii) any sale of the Property pursuant to a private power of sale under or judicial foreclosure of any mortgage or other security instrument or device to which Lessor’s interest in the Property is now or hereafter subject; (iii) any transfer of Lessor’s interest in the Property to a mortgagee or other holder of a security interest therein or their designees by deed in lieu of foreclosure; (iv) any transfer of the Property to any governmental or quasi-governmental agency with power of Condemnation; (v) any transfer of the Property to any Affiliate of Lessor; (vi) any transfers of interests in Lessor by any member, shareholder, partner or other owner to any other member, shareholder, partner or other owner; and (vii) any transfers to any Person to whom Lessor sells all or substantially all of its assets.

Section 18.02. No Merger. There shall be no merger of this Lease nor of the leasehold estate created by this Lease with the fee estate in or ownership of any of the Properties by reason of the fact that the same person, corporation, firm or other entity may acquire or hold or own, directly or indirectly, (a) this Lease or the leasehold estate created by this Lease or any interest in this Lease or in such leasehold estate, and (b) the fee estate or ownership of any of the Properties or any interest in such fee estate or ownership. No such merger shall occur unless and until all persons, corporations, firms and other entities having any interest in (i) this Lease or the leasehold estate created by this Lease, and (ii) the fee estate in or ownership of
STORE/ Ascent (Synalloy) Seventh Amended and Restated Master Lease File No. 7210/02-475 31 4936-7403-8122.2 the Properties or any part thereof sought to be merged shall join in a written instrument effecting such merger and shall duly record the same. Section 18.03. Interpretation. Lessor and Lessee acknowledge and warrant to each other that each has been represented by independent counsel and has executed this Lease after being fully advised by said counsel as to its effect and significance. This Lease shall be interpreted and construed in a fair and impartial manner without regard to such factors as the party which prepared the instrument, the relative bargaining powers of the parties or the domicile of any party. Whenever in this Lease any words of obligation or duty are used, such words or expressions shall have the same force and effect as though made in the form of a covenant. Section 18.04. Characterization. The following expressions of intent, representations, warranties, covenants, agreements, stipulations and waivers are a material inducement to Lessor entering into this Lease: (a) Lessor and Lessee intend that (i) this Lease constitutes an unseverable, unitary and single lease of all, but not less than all, of the Properties, and, if at any time this Lease covers other real property in addition to the Properties, neither this Lease, nor Lessee’s obligations or rights hereunder may be allocated or otherwise divided among such properties by Lessee; (ii) this Lease is a “true lease,” is not a financing lease, capital lease, mortgage, equitable mortgage, deed of trust, trust agreement, security agreement or other financing or trust arrangement, and the economic realities of this Lease are those of a true lease; and (iii) the business relationship created by this Lease and any related documents is solely that of a long-term commercial lease between Lessor and Lessee, the Lease has been entered into by both parties in reliance upon the economic and legal bargains contained herein, and none of the agreements contained herein is intended, nor shall the same be deemed or construed, to create a partnership (de facto or de jure) between Lessor and Lessee, to make them joint venturers, to make Lessee an agent, legal representative, partner, subsidiary or employee of Lessor, nor to make Lessor in any way responsible for the debts, obligations or losses of Lessee. (b) Lessor and Lessee covenant and agree that: (i) each intends to treat this Lease as an operating lease pursuant to Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13, as amended, and as a true lease for state Law reporting purposes and for federal income tax purposes; (ii) each party will not, nor will it permit any Affiliate to, at any time, take any action or fail to take any action with respect to the preparation or filing of any statement or disclosure to Governmental Authority, including without limitation, any income tax return (including an amended income tax return), to the extent that such action or such failure to take action would be inconsistent with the intention of the parties expressed in this Section 18.04; (iii) with respect to the Properties, the Lease Term is less than seventy-five percent (75%) of the estimated remaining economic life of the Properties; and (iv) the Base Annual Rental is the fair market value for the use of the Properties and was agreed to by Lessor and Lessee on that basis, and the execution and delivery of, and the performance by Lessee of its obligations under, this Lease do not constitute a transfer of all or any part of the Properties. (c) Lessee waives any claim or defense based upon the characterization of this Lease as anything other than a true lease and as a master lease of all of the
