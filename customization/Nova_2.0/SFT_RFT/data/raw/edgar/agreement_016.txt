the Holders of the Preferred Stock then outstanding shall first receive, or simultaneously receive, a dividend on each outstanding share

such class or series determined, if applicable, as if all shares of such class or series had been converted into Common Stock and (2)
the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of a share of Series A Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, in each case
calculated on the record date for determination of holders entitled to receive such dividend or (B) in the case of a dividend on any class
or series of capital stock of the Corporation ranking junior to the Preferred Stock that is not convertible into Common Stock, at a rate
per share of Preferred Stock determined by (1) dividing the amount of the dividend payable on each share of such class or series of capital
stock by the original issuance price of such class or series of capital stock (subject to appropriate adjustment in the event of any stock
dividend, stock split, combination or other similar recapitalization with respect to such class or series) and (2) multiplying such fraction
by an amount equal to the Accrued Value; provided that if the Corporation declares, pays or sets aside, on the same date, a dividend on
shares of more than one class or series of capital stock of the Corporation that is junior to the Preferred Stock, the dividend payable
to the Holders of Preferred Stock pursuant to this
Section 3
shall be calculated based upon the dividend on the class or series
of capital stock that would result in the highest Preferred Stock dividend.
(c)
Subject to
Section 5
and
Section 7
, the Holders shall be entitled to receive, and the Corporation shall
pay, dividends on shares of Preferred Stock (other than Accrued Dividends), on an as-converted basis, equal to and in the same form as
dividends actually paid on shares of the Common Stock when, as and if such dividends are paid on shares of the Common Stock.
(d)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, to the extent that the Holder’s right to participate in any dividend would
result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation, then the Holder shall not be entitled to participate in such dividend
to such extent (or in the beneficial ownership of any shares of Common Stock as a result of such Distribution to such extent) and the
portion of such dividend shall be held in abeyance for the benefit of the Holder until such time, if ever, such grant, issuance or sale,
as its right thereto would not result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation.
Section 4.
Voting Rights
.
(a)
The Holders shall be entitled to notice of any meeting of stockholders of the Corporation and, except as otherwise required by
law or as may be provided herein, shall vote together with the holders of Common Stock as a single class upon any matter submitted to
the stockholders for a vote.
9
(b)
On any matter presented to the stockholders of the Corporation for their action or consideration at any meeting of the stockholders
of the Corporation (or by written consent in lieu of a meeting), a Holder, together with its Attribution Parties, shall be entitled to
the number of votes equal to the number of whole shares of Common Stock into which the shares of Preferred Stock held by such Holder,
together with its Attribution Parties, as are convertible on the record date for determining stockholders entitled to vote on such matter
(as adjusted from time to time pursuant to
Section 7
hereof and subject to the Beneficial Ownership Limitation), but without regard
as to whether sufficient shares of Common Stock are available out of the Corporation’s authorized by unissued stock, for the purpose
of effecting the conversion of the Preferred Stock.
(c)
As long as at least 20% or more of the shares of Preferred Stock issued as of the Closing are outstanding, the Corporation shall
not, without the affirmative vote or action by written consent of the Holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of the
Preferred Stock (the “
Required Holders
”):
(i)
liquidate, dissolve or wind-up the affairs of the Corporation;
(ii)
amend, alter or repeal the Corporation’s certificate of incorporation or bylaws, this Certificate of Designation or any similar
document of the Corporation in a manner that materially and adversely affects the powers, preferences or rights given to the Preferred
Stock;
(iii)
create any equity security, authorize the creation of any equity security, classify any equity security, reclassify any equity
security, or issue any other security convertible into or exercisable for any equity security, unless such security ranks junior to the
Preferred Stock with respect to its rights, preferences and privileges or increase the number of authorized shares of Preferred Stock;
(iv)
except as set forth in
Section 3
, purchase or redeem or pay any cash dividend on any capital stock of the Corporation ranking
junior to the Preferred Stock prior to payment of such cash dividend on the Preferred Stock or purchase or redeem any capital stock of
the Corporation ranking junior to the Preferred Stock, other than capital stock repurchased at cost from former employees and consultants
in connection with the cessation of their service or pursuant to the terms of any equity incentive plan of the Corporation;
(v)
enter into any transaction with an affiliate, other than the issuance of equity or awards to eligible participants under the Corporation’s
incentive plan, equity plan or equity-based compensation plan or with respect to employment, consulting or award agreements with respect
to executive officers of the Corporation, in each case regardless of whether such person (or such person’s affiliates) would be
considered an affiliate of the Corporation; or
10
(vi)
incur or guarantee any indebtedness other than equipment leases or trade payables incurred in the ordinary course of business;
provided
,
however
, that the Preferred Stock shall not be considered indebtedness for purposes of this calculation.
(d)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
Section 6(d)
may not be amended, modified or waived in any manner
that materially and adversely affects a Holder of Preferred Stock without such Holder’s consent.
Section 5.
Ranking; Liquidation
.
(a)
The Preferred Stock shall rank senior to all of the Common Stock and any other class or series of capital stock of the Corporation
currently existing or hereafter authorized, classified or reclassified by the Corporation (collectively, “
Junior Securities
”),
in each case, as to rights to receive dividends or to participate in distributions of assets or payments upon liquidation, dissolution
or winding up of the Corporation, whether voluntarily or involuntarily.
(b)
Preferential
Payments to Holders of Preferred Stock; Distribution of Remaining Assets
.
(i)
In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, the Holders of shares of
Preferred Stock then outstanding shall be entitled to be paid out of the assets of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders,
and in the event of a Deemed Liquidation Event, the Holders of shares of Preferred Stock then outstanding shall be entitled to be paid
out of the consideration payable to stockholders in such Deemed Liquidation Event or out of the Available Proceeds (as defined below),
as applicable, before any payment shall be made to the holders of Common Stock or other Junior Securities by reason of their ownership
thereof, an amount per share equal to the greater of (i) 100% of the Accrued Value on each share of Preferred Stock or (ii) such
amount per share as would have been payable had all shares of Preferred Stock been converted into Common Stock pursuant to
Section
6
immediately prior to such liquidation, dissolution, winding up or Deemed Liquidation Event based on the then effective rate of conversion
and without giving effect to the Beneficial Ownership Limitation or any other limitations on conversion set forth herein. If upon any
such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation or Deemed Liquidation Event, the assets of the Corporation available for
distribution to its stockholders shall be insufficient to pay the Holders of shares of Preferred Stock the full amount to which they shall
be entitled under this
Section 5(b)
, the Holders of shares of Preferred Stock shall share ratably in any distribution of the assets
available for distribution in proportion to the respective amounts that would otherwise be payable in respect of the shares held by them
upon such distribution if all amounts payable on or with respect to such shares were paid in full.
(ii)
In the event of any voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation, after the payment in full
of all amounts required to be paid to the holders of shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to
Section 5(b)(i)
, the remaining assets
of the Corporation available for distribution to its stockholders or, in the case of a Deemed Liquidation Event, the consideration not
payable to the holders of shares of Preferred Stock pursuant to
Section 5(b)(i)
or the remaining Available Proceeds, as the case
may be, shall be distributed among the holders of the shares of Preferred Stock and Common Stock, pro rata based on the number of shares
held by each such holder, treating for this purpose all such securities as if they had been converted to Common Stock pursuant to the
terms of this Certificate of Designation immediately prior to such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation. The aggregate
amount which a holder of a share of Preferred Stock is entitled to receive under
Sections 5(b)(i)
and
5(b)(ii)
is hereinafter
referred to as the “
Preferred Stock Liquidation Amount
.”
11
(c)
Deemed Liquidation
Events
.
(i)
In the event of a Deemed Liquidation Event, if the Corporation does not effect a dissolution of the Corporation under the Delaware
General Corporation Law within ninety (90) days after such Deemed Liquidation Event, then (i) the Corporation shall send a written notice
to each Holder of Preferred Stock no later than the ninetieth (90
th
) day after the Deemed Liquidation Event advising such Holders
of their right (and the requirements to be met to secure such right) pursuant to the terms of the following clause to require the redemption
of such shares of Preferred Stock, and (ii) if the Required Holders so request in a written instrument delivered to the Corporation not
later than one hundred twenty (120) days after such Deemed Liquidation Event, the Corporation shall use the consideration received by
the Corporation for such Deemed Liquidation Event (net of any retained liabilities associated with the assets sold or technology licensed,
or any other expenses associated with the Deemed Liquidation Event or the dissolution of the Corporation, in each case as determined in
good faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation), together with any other assets of the Corporation available for distribution
to its stockholders, all to the extent permitted by Delaware law governing distributions to stockholders (the “
Available Proceeds
”),
on the one hundred fiftieth (150
th
) day after such Deemed Liquidation Event, to redeem all outstanding shares of Preferred
Stock at a price per share equal to the Preferred Stock Liquidation Amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of a redemption
pursuant to the preceding sentence, if the Available Proceeds are not sufficient to redeem all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock,
the Corporation shall redeem a pro rata portion of each Holder’s shares of Preferred Stock to the fullest extent of such Available
Proceeds, based on the respective amounts that would otherwise be payable in respect of the shares to be redeemed if the Available Proceeds
were sufficient to redeem all such shares, and shall redeem the remaining shares as soon as it may lawfully do so under Delaware law governing
distributions to stockholders. The provisions of
(i)
shall apply, with such necessary changes in the details thereof as are necessitated
by the context, to the redemption of the Preferred Stock pursuant to this
Section 5(c)(i)
. Prior to the distribution or redemption
provided for in this
Section 5(c)(i)
, the Corporation shall not expend or dissipate the consideration received for such Deemed
Liquidation Event, except to discharge expenses incurred in connection with such Deemed Liquidation Event.
(ii)
In any Deemed Liquidation Event, if Available Proceeds are in a form of property other than in cash, the value of such distribution
shall be deemed to be the fair market value of such property. The determination of fair market value of such property shall be made in
good faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation, provided that to the extent such property consists of securities, the fair market
value of such securities shall be determined as follows:
For securities not subject
to investment letters or other similar restrictions on free marketability covered by
Section 5(c)(iii)
below, the value shall be
the VWAP of such securities.
(iii)
The method of valuation of securities subject to investment letters or other similar restrictions on free marketability (other
than restrictions arising solely by virtue of a stockholder’s status as an affiliate or former affiliate) shall take into account
an appropriate discount (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Corporation) from the market value as determined
pursuant to
Section 5(c)(ii)
above so as to reflect the approximate fair market value thereof.
12
(iv)
If any portion of the consideration payable to the stockholders of the Corporation is payable only upon satisfaction of contingencies
(the “
Additional Consideration
”), (a) the portion of such consideration that is not Additional Consideration (such
portion, the “
Initial Consideration
”) shall be allocated in accordance with the foregoing
Section 5(b)
and this
Section 5(c)
as if the Initial Consideration were the only consideration payable in connection with such Deemed Liquidation Event;
and (b) any Additional Consideration which becomes payable to the stockholders of the Corporation upon satisfaction of such contingencies
shall be allocated among the holders of capital stock of the Corporation in accordance with
Sections 5(b)
and
5(c)
after
taking into account the previous payment of the Initial Consideration as part of the same transaction. For the purposes of this
Section
5(c)(iv)
, consideration placed into escrow or retained as a holdback to be available for satisfaction of indemnification or similar
obligations in connection with such Deemed Liquidation Event shall be deemed to be Additional Consideration.
Section 6.
Conversion
.
(a)
Conversions
at Option of Holder
. Each share of Preferred Stock shall be convertible, at any time and from time to time from and after the Original
Issue Date at the option of the Holder thereof, into that number of whole shares of Common Stock (subject to the limitations set forth
in
Section 6(d)
) determined by dividing the Accrued Value of such share of Preferred Stock by the Conversion Price. Holders
shall effect conversions by providing the Corporation with the form of conversion notice attached hereto as
Annex A
(a
“
Notice of Conversion
”), unless the Corporation directs Holders that the Notice of Conversion shall be delivered to
the Corporation’s transfer agent. Each Notice of Conversion shall specify the number of shares of Preferred Stock to be converted,
the number of shares of Preferred Stock owned prior to the conversion at issue, the number of shares of Preferred Stock owned subsequent
to the conversion at issue and the date on which such conversion is to be effected, which date may not be prior to the date the applicable
Holder delivers by e-mail attachment or by a nationally recognized overnight courier service such Notice of Conversion to the Corporation
(such date, the “
Conversion Date
”). If no Conversion Date is specified in a Notice of Conversion, the Conversion Date
shall be the date that such Notice of Conversion to the Corporation is deemed delivered hereunder. No ink-original Notice of Conversion
shall be required, nor shall any medallion guarantee (or other type of guarantee or notarization) of any Notice of Conversion form be
required. The calculations and entries set forth in the Notice of Conversion shall control in the absence of manifest or mathematical
error. To effect conversions of shares of Preferred Stock, a Holder shall not be required to surrender the certificate(s) representing
the shares of Preferred Stock to the Corporation unless all of the shares of Preferred Stock represented thereby are so converted, in
which case such Holder shall deliver the certificate representing such shares of Preferred Stock promptly following the Conversion Date
at issue. Shares of Preferred Stock converted into Common Stock or redeemed in accordance with the terms hereof shall be canceled and
shall not be reissued, and all rights (other than the right to receive the Conversion Shares) with respect to such shares will terminate.
The Corporation’s stock ledger and transfer book shall serve as the exclusive record of outstanding shares of Preferred Stock.
(b)
Conversion Price
. The initial conversion price is $12.00, subject to adjustment herein (the “
Conversion Price
”).
13
(c)
Mechanics
of Conversion
(i)
Delivery
of Conversion Shares Upon Conversion
. Not later than the number of Trading Days comprising the Standard Settlement Period (as
defined below) after each Conversion Date (the “
Share Delivery Date
”), the Corporation shall deliver, or cause to
be delivered, to the converting Holder (A) the number of Conversion Shares being acquired upon the conversion of the Preferred
Stock, which on or after the earlier of (i) the one year anniversary of the Original Issue Date or (ii) the Effective Date, shall be
free of restrictive legends and trading restrictions (other than those which may then be required by any Purchase Agreement or any
other applicable lock-up agreement or similar agreement) and (B) cash in an amount equal to any accrued and unpaid dividends, if
any. On or after the earlier of (i) the one year anniversary of the Original Issue Date or (ii) the Effective Date, the Corporation
shall deliver the Conversion Shares required to be delivered by the Corporation under this
Section 6
electronically
through the Depository Trust Company or another established clearing corporation performing similar functions. As used herein,
“
Standard Settlement Period
” means the standard settlement period, expressed in a number of Trading Days, on the
Corporation’s primary Trading Market with respect to the Common Stock as in effect on the date of delivery of the Notice of
Conversion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, with respect to any Notice(s) of Conversion delivered at or prior to 12:00 p.m. (New York
City time) on the Original Issue Date, the Corporation agrees to deliver the Conversion Shares subject to such notice(s) by 4:00
p.m. (New York City time) on the Original Issue Date.
(ii)
Failure to Deliver Conversion Shares
. If, in the case of any Notice of Conversion, such Conversion Shares are not delivered to
or as reasonably directed by the applicable Holder by the Share Delivery Date, the Holder shall be entitled to elect by written
notice to the Corporation at any time on or before its receipt of such Conversion Shares, to rescind such conversion, in which event
the Corporation shall promptly return to the Holder any original Preferred Stock certificate delivered to the Corporation and the
Holder shall promptly return to the Corporation the Conversion Shares issued to such Holder pursuant to the rescinded Notice of
Conversion.
(iii)
Obligation
Absolute; Partial Liquidated Damages
. The Corporation’s obligation to issue and deliver the Conversion Shares upon conversion
of Preferred Stock in accordance with the terms hereof are absolute and unconditional, irrespective of any action or inaction by a Holder
to enforce the same, any waiver or consent with respect to any provision hereof, the recovery of any judgment against any Person or any
action to enforce the same, or any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, limitation or termination, or any breach or alleged breach by such
Holder or any other Person of any obligation to the Corporation or any violation or alleged violation of law by such Holder or any other
person, and irrespective of any other circumstance which might otherwise limit such obligation of the Corporation to such Holder in connection
with the issuance of such Conversion Shares;
provided
,
however
, that such delivery shall not operate as a
waiver by the Corporation of any such action that the Corporation may have against such Holder. In the event a Holder shall elect to
convert any or all of the Accrued Value of its Preferred Stock, the Corporation may not refuse conversion based on any claim that such
Holder or anyone associated or affiliated with such Holder has been engaged in any violation of law, agreement or for any other reason,
unless an injunction from a court, on notice to Holder, restraining and/or enjoining conversion of all or part of the Preferred Stock
of such Holder shall have been sought and obtained, and the Corporation posts a surety bond for the benefit of such Holder in the amount
of 150% of the Accrued Value of Preferred Stock which is subject to the injunction, which bond shall remain in effect until the completion
of arbitration/litigation of the underlying dispute and the proceeds of which shall be payable to such Holder to the extent it obtains
judgment. In the absence of such injunction, the Corporation shall issue Conversion Shares and, if applicable, cash, upon a properly
noticed conversion. If the Corporation fails to deliver to a Holder such Conversion Shares pursuant to
Section 6(c)(i)
by 10
th
Trading Day after the Share Delivery Date applicable to such conversion, the Corporation shall pay to such Holder, in cash, as liquidated
damages and not as a penalty, for each $5,000 of Accrued Value of Preferred Stock being converted, $25 per Trading Day (increasing to
$50 per Trading Day on the third Trading Day and increasing to $100 per Trading Day on the sixth Trading Day after such damages begin
to accrue) for each Trading Day after the 10
th
Trading Day after the Share Delivery Date until such Conversion Shares are
delivered or Holder rescinds such conversion. Nothing herein shall limit a Holder’s right to pursue actual damages for the Corporation’s
failure to deliver Conversion Shares within the period specified herein and such Holder shall have the right to pursue all remedies available
to it hereunder, at law or in equity, including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief. The exercise
of any such rights shall not prohibit a Holder from seeking to enforce damages pursuant to any other Section hereof or under applicable
law.
14
(iv)
Compensation for Buy-In on Failure to Timely Deliver Conversion Shares Upon Conversion
. In addition to any other rights
available to the Holder, if the Corporation fails for any reason unrelated to the actions of the Holder or its Affiliates to deliver to
a Holder the applicable Conversion Shares by the Share Delivery Date pursuant to
Section 6(c)(i)
, and if after such Share
Delivery Date such Holder is required by its brokerage firm to purchase (in an open market transaction or otherwise), or the Holder’s
brokerage firm otherwise purchases, shares of Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by such Holder of the Conversion Shares
which such Holder was entitled to receive upon the conversion relating to such Share Delivery Date (a “
Buy-In
”), then
the Corporation shall (A) pay in cash to such Holder (in addition to any other remedies available to or elected by such Holder) the amount,
if any, by which (x) such Holder’s total purchase price (including any brokerage commissions) for the Common Stock so purchased
exceeds (y) the product of (1) the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that such Holder was entitled to receive from the conversion
at issue multiplied by (2) the actual sale price at which the sell order giving rise to such purchase obligation was executed (excluding
any brokerage commissions) and (B) at the option of such Holder, either reissue (if surrendered) the shares of Preferred Stock equal to
the number of shares of Preferred Stock submitted for conversion (in which case, such conversion shall be deemed rescinded) or deliver
to such Holder the number of shares of Common Stock that would have been issued if the Corporation had timely complied with its delivery
requirements under
Section 6(c)(i)
. For example, if a Holder purchases shares of Common Stock having a total purchase price
of $11,000 to cover a Buy-In with respect to an attempted conversion of shares of Preferred Stock with respect to which the actual sale
price of the Conversion Shares (including any applicable brokerage commissions) giving rise to such purchase obligation was a total of
$10,000, under clause (A) of the immediately preceding sentence, the Corporation shall be required to pay such Holder $1,000. The Holder
shall provide the Corporation written notice indicating the amounts payable to such Holder in respect of the Buy-In and, upon the request
of the Corporation, evidence of the amount of such loss. If a Holder purchases shares of Common Stock having a total purchase price of
$9,000 to cover a Buy-In with respect to an attempted conversion of shares of Preferred Stock with respect to which the actual sale price
of the Conversion Shares (including any applicable brokerage commissions) giving rise to such purchase obligation was a total of $10,000,
under clause (A) of the preceding sentence, the Corporation shall not be required to pay Holder any amount. For the avoidance of doubt,
in the event of a Buy-In, the Holder shall use commercially reasonable efforts to purchase shares at the lowest available price, paying
the lowest reasonably available brokerage commission. The Holder shall provide the Corporation written notice indicating the amounts payable
to such Holder in respect of the Buy-In and evidence of the amount of such loss. Nothing herein shall limit a Holder’s right to
pursue any other remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance
and/or injunctive relief with respect to the Corporation’s failure to timely deliver Conversion Shares upon conversion of the shares
of Preferred Stock as required pursuant to the terms hereof.
(v)
Reservation of Shares Issuable Upon Conversion
. The Corporation covenants that it will at all times reserve and keep available
out of its authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock for the sole purpose of issuance upon conversion of the Preferred Stock as herein
provided, free from preemptive rights or any other actual contingent purchase rights of Persons other than the Holder (and the other Holders
of the Preferred Stock), not less than such aggregate number of shares of the Common Stock as shall (subject to the terms and conditions
set forth in the Purchase Agreement) be issuable (taking into account the adjustments and restrictions of
Section 7
) upon
the conversion of the then outstanding shares of Preferred Stock (assuming for such purpose a Conversion Price equal to the Floor Price
and any such conversions are made without regard to any limitations on conversion set forth herein). The Corporation covenants that all
shares of Common Stock that shall be so issuable shall, upon issue, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and,
if a Registration Statement is then effective under the Securities Act, shall be registered for public resale in accordance with such
Registration Statement (subject to such Holder’s compliance with its obligations under the Registration Rights Agreement).
(vi)
Fractional Shares
. No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of the
Preferred Stock. As to any fraction of a share which the Holder would otherwise be entitled to purchase upon such conversion, the Corporation
shall at its election, either pay a cash adjustment in respect of such final fraction in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by
the Conversion Price or round up to the next whole share. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, but consistent with
the provisions of this subsection with respect to fractional Conversion Shares, nothing shall prevent any Holder from converting fractional
shares of Preferred Stock.
15
(vii)
Transfer
Taxes and Expenses
. The issuance of Conversion Shares on conversion of this Preferred Stock shall be made without charge to any Holder
for any documentary stamp or similar taxes that may be payable in respect of the issue or delivery of such Conversion Shares,
provided
that
the Corporation shall not be required to pay any tax that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issuance
and delivery of any such Conversion Shares upon conversion in a name other than that of the Holders of such shares of Preferred Stock
and the Corporation shall not be required to issue or deliver such Conversion Shares unless or until the Person or Persons requesting
the issuance thereof shall have paid to the Corporation the amount of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Corporation
that such tax has been paid.
(d)
Beneficial Ownership Limitation
. A Holder may notify the Corporation in writing in the event it elects to be subject to
the provisions contained in this
Section 6(d)
; however, no Holder shall be subject to this
Section 6(d)
unless he, she or
it makes such election. If the election is made, (i) the Corporation shall not effect any conversion of the Preferred Stock, and such
Holder shall not have the right to convert all or any portion of the Preferred Stock, to the extent that, after giving effect to the conversion
set forth on the applicable Notice of Conversion, such Holder (together with such Holder’s Affiliates, and any Persons acting as
a group together with such Holder or any of such Holder’s Affiliates (such Persons, “
Attribution Parties
”)) would
beneficially own in excess of 4.9%, 9.9%, 19.9% of the Corporation’s Common Stock (or such other amount as a Holder may specify)
(the “
Beneficial Ownership Limitation
”) and (ii) the Corporation shall not permit the Holder to vote, and such Holder
shall not have the right vote pursuant to
Section 4(b)
of this Certificate of Designation, all or any portion of the Preferred
Stock that such Holder is not permitted to convert pursuant to the preceding clause (i) (provided, however, that such Holder shall retain
the right to vote pursuant to
Section 4(c)
of this Certificate of Designation to the extent that retaining such right does not
cause such Holder to be deemed to beneficially own Conversion Shares within the meaning of Rule 13d-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act).
For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by such Holder and its Affiliates and
Attribution Parties shall include the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Stock with respect to
which such determination is being made, but shall exclude the number of shares of Common Stock which are issuable upon (i) conversion
of the remaining, unconverted Accrued Value of Preferred Stock beneficially owned by such Holder or any of its Affiliates or Attribution
Parties and (ii) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or unconverted portion of any other securities of the Corporation subject to
a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained herein beneficially owned by such Holder or any of its Affiliates
or Attribution Parties. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, for purposes of this
Section 6(d)
, beneficial ownership
shall be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. To the
extent that the limitation contained in this
Section 6(d)
applies, the determination of whether the Preferred Stock is convertible
(in relation to other securities owned by such Holder together with any Affiliates and Attribution Parties) and of how many shares of
Preferred Stock are convertible shall be in the sole discretion of such Holder, and the submission of a Notice of Conversion shall be
deemed to be such Holder’s determination of whether the shares of Preferred Stock may be converted (in relation to other securities
owned by such Holder together with any Affiliates and Attribution Parties) and how many shares of the Preferred Stock are convertible,
in each case subject to the Beneficial Ownership Limitation. To ensure compliance with this restriction, each Holder will be deemed to
represent to the Corporation each time it delivers a Notice of Conversion that such Notice of Conversion has not violated the restrictions
set forth in this paragraph and the Corporation shall have no obligation to verify or confirm the accuracy of such determination. In addition,
a determination as to any group status as contemplated above shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act
and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. The Holder shall provide the Corporation with any information reasonably requested
by the Corporation in connection with this Beneficial Ownership Limitation and the provisions related thereto, in each case with respect
to the Corporation’s reporting obligations pursuant to the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, or other federal or state securities
regulations. For purposes of this
Section 6(d)
, in determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, a Holder
may rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock as stated in the most recent of the following: (i) the Corporation’s
most recent periodic or annual report filed with the Commission, as the case may be, (ii) a more recent public announcement by the Corporation
or (iii) a more recent written notice by the Corporation or the Transfer Agent setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding.
Upon the written or oral request (which may be via email) of a Holder, the Corporation shall within two Trading Days confirm in writing
to such Holder the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding. In any case, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall
be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Corporation, including the Preferred Stock, by such
Holder or its Affiliates or Attribution Parties since the date as of which such number of outstanding shares of Common Stock was reported.
By written notice to the Corporation, a Holder may from time to time increase or decrease the Beneficial Ownership Limitation applicable
to such Holder, provided, however, that any such increase in the Beneficial Ownership Limitation will not be effective until the sixty-first
(61
st
) day after such notice is delivered to the Corporation. The provisions of this paragraph
shall be construed and implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict conformity with the terms of this
Section 6(d)
to
correct this paragraph (or any portion hereof) which may be defective or inconsistent with the intended Beneficial Ownership Limitation
contained herein or to make changes or supplements necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such limitation. The limitations
contained in this paragraph shall apply to a successor Holder of Preferred Stock.
16
Section 7.
Certain Adjustments
.
(a)
Stock Dividends and Stock Splits
. If the Corporation, at any time while this Preferred Stock is outstanding: (i) pays a
stock dividend or otherwise makes a distribution or distributions payable in shares of Common Stock on shares of Common Stock or any other
Common Stock Equivalents (which, for avoidance of doubt, shall not include any shares of Common Stock issued by the Corporation upon conversion
of, or payment of a dividend on, this Preferred Stock or any cash distributions), (ii) subdivides outstanding shares of Common Stock into
a larger number of shares, (iii) combines (including by way of a reverse stock split) outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller
number of shares, or (iv) issues, in the event of a reclassification of shares of the Common Stock, any shares of capital stock of the
Corporation, then each of the Conversion Price and the Floor Price shall be multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the
number of shares of Common Stock (excluding any treasury shares of the Corporation) outstanding immediately before such event, and of
which the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such event. Any adjustment made pursuant
to this
Section 7(a)
shall become effective immediately after the record date for the determination of stockholders entitled
to receive such dividend or distribution and shall become effective immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision,
combination or re-classification.
(b)
VWAP Reset
. If on the twenty-first trading day following the date that is six months after the Closing Date, the VWAP (the
“
Measurement Price
”) is less than the Conversion Price then in effect, then the Conversion Price then in effect shall
be reduced to an amount equal to the greater of (i) the Measurement Price and (ii) $5.00.
(c)
Adjustment of Conversion Price upon Issuance of Common Stock
. If and whenever on or after the Closing Date until the first
date on which no shares of Preferred Stock are outstanding the Corporation issues or sells, or in accordance with this
Section
7(c)
is deemed to have issued or sold, any shares of Common Stock (including the issuance or sale of shares of Common Stock owned
or held by or for the account of the Corporation,
but
excluding shares of Common Stock issued or sold, or deemed
to have been issued or sold, by the Corporation in connection with any Exempt Issuance) for a consideration per share (the “
New
Issuance Price
”) less than the Conversion Price then in effect (each such issue, sale or deemed issuance or sale, a “
Dilutive
Issuance
”), where the aggregate amount of consideration received by the Corporation, together with all prior issuances and sales
conducted for the purpose of raising capital by the Corporation on or after the Closing Date that were excluded from this
Section 7(c)
by this clause, exceeds $500,000, then, immediately after such Dilutive Issuance, the Conversion Price then in effect shall be reduced
to an amount equal to the New Issuance Price. For all purposes of the foregoing (including, without limitation, determining the adjusted
Conversion Price and the New Issuance Price under this
Section 7(c)
), the following shall be applicable:
(i)
Options
and Convertible Securities
. The consideration per share received by the Corporation for Common Stock issued or deemed to have
been issued pursuant to
Section 7(c)(ii)
, relating to Options and Convertible Securities, shall be determined by
dividing:
a.
the total amount, if any, received or receivable by the Corporation as consideration for the issue of
such Options or Convertible Securities, plus the minimum aggregate amount of additional consideration (as set forth in the instruments
relating thereto, without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such consideration) payable to the
Corporation upon the exercise of such Options or the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, or in the case of Options
for Convertible Securities, the exercise of such Options for Convertible Securities and the conversion or exchange of such Convertible
Securities, by
17
b.
the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as set forth in the instruments relating thereto, without
regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent adjustment of such number) deemed to be issued pursuant to
Section 7(c)(ii)
upon the issuance of such Options or Convertible Securities.
(ii)
Deemed Issuance of Options and Convertible Securities
.
a.
If the Corporation at any time or from time to time shall issue any Options or Convertible Securities
or shall fix a record date for the determination of holders of any class of securities entitled to receive any such Options or Convertible
Securities, then the maximum number of shares of Common Stock (as set forth in the instrument relating thereto, assuming the satisfaction
of any conditions to exercisability, convertibility or exchangeability but without regard to any provision contained therein for a subsequent
adjustment of such number) issuable upon the exercise of such Options or, in the case of Convertible Securities and Options therefor,
the conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities, shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued as of the time of
such issue or, in case such a record date shall have been fixed, as of the close of business on such record date.
b.
If the purchase or exercise price provided for in any Options, the additional consideration, if any, payable
upon the issue, conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Securities, or the rate at which any Convertible Securities are convertible
into or exercisable or exchangeable for Common Stock increases or decreases at any time (other than (i) proportional changes in conversion
or exercise prices, as applicable, in connection with an event referred to in
Section 7(a)
above and (ii) automatic adjustments
to such terms pursuant to anti-dilution or similar provisions of such Option or Convertible Security which are not more favorable to the
holder thereof than the anti-dilution and similar provisions set forth herein), the Conversion Price in effect at the time of such increase
or decrease shall be adjusted to the Conversion Price which would have been in effect at such time had such Options or Convertible Securities
provided for such increased or decreased purchase price, additional consideration or increased or decreased conversion rate (as the case
may be) at the time initially granted, issued or sold. For purposes of this
Section 7(c)
, if the terms of any Option or Convertible
Security that was outstanding as of the date of first issuance of a share of Preferred Stock are increased or decreased in the manner
described in the immediately preceding sentence, then such Option or Convertible Security and the shares of Common Stock deemed issuable
upon exercise, conversion or exchange thereof shall be deemed to have been issued as of the date of such increase or decrease. No adjustment
pursuant to this
Section 7(c)(ii)
shall be made if such adjustment would result in an increase of the Conversion Price then in
effect.
18
(iii)
Calculation of Consideration Received
.
a.
In case one or more Option is issued in connection with the issue or sale of other securities of the Corporation,
together comprising one integrated transaction, (x) each such Option will be deemed to have been issued for the Option Value of such Option
and (y) the other securities issued or sold in such integrated transaction shall be deemed to have been issued or sold for the difference
of (I) the aggregate consideration received by the Corporation less any consideration paid or payable by the Corporation pursuant to the
terms of such other securities of the Corporation, less (II) the Option Value of each such Option.
b.
If any shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities are issued or sold or deemed to have
been issued or sold for cash, the consideration other than cash received therefor will be deemed to be the net amount received by the
Corporation therefor. If any shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities are issued or sold for a consideration other than
cash, the amount of such consideration received by the Corporation will be the fair value of such consideration, except where such consideration
consists of publicly traded securities, in which case the amount of consideration received by the Corporation will be the VWAP of such
publicly traded securities on the date of receipt. If any shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities are issued to the
owners of the non-surviving entity in connection with any merger in which the Corporation is the surviving entity, the amount of consideration
therefor will be deemed to be the fair value of such portion of the net assets and business of the non-surviving entity as is attributable
to such shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities, as the case may be. The fair value of any consideration other than
cash or publicly traded securities will be determined jointly by the Corporation and the Required Holders. If such parties are unable
to reach agreement within ten (10) days after the occurrence of an event requiring valuation (the “
Valuation Event
”),
the fair value of such consideration will be determined within five (5) Business Days after the tenth (10th) day following the Valuation
Event by an independent, reputable appraiser jointly selected by the Corporation and the Required Holders. The determination of such appraiser
shall be final and binding upon all parties absent manifest error and the fees and expenses of such appraiser shall be borne by the Corporation.
(iv)
Record Date
. If the Corporation takes a record of the holders of shares of Common Stock for the purpose of entitling them
(A) to receive a dividend or other distribution payable in shares of Common Stock, Options or in Convertible Securities or (B) to subscribe
for or purchase shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities, then such record date will be deemed to be the date of the
issuance or sale of the shares of Common Stock deemed to have been issued or sold upon the declaration of such dividend or the making
of such other distribution or the date of the granting of such right of subscription or purchase (as the case may be).
(v)
Expiration or Termination of Options or Convertible Securities
. Upon the expiration or termination of any unexercised Option
or unconverted or unexchanged Convertible Securities (or portion thereof) which resulted (either upon its original issuance or upon a
revision of its terms) in an adjustment to the Conversion Price pursuant to the terms of
Section 7(c)
, the Conversion Price shall
be readjusted to such Conversion Price as would have obtained had such Option or Convertible Securities (or portion thereof) never been
issued.
19
(d)
Subsequent Rights Offerings
. In addition to any adjustments pursuant to
Section 7(a)
and
Section 7(c)
above, if at any time the Corporation grants, issues or sells any Common Stock Equivalents or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities
or other property pro rata to the record holders of any class of shares of Common Stock (the “
Purchase Rights
”), then
the Holders will be entitled to acquire, upon the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which the Holder
could have acquired if the Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of such Holder’s
Preferred Stock (without regard to any limitations on conversion hereof, including without limitation, the Beneficial Ownership Limitation)
immediately before the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, or, if no such record
is taken, the date as of which the record holders of shares of Common Stock are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such
Purchase Rights (
provided
,
however
, that, to the extent that the Holder’s right to participate in any
such Purchase Right would result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation, then the Holder shall not be entitled to
participate in such Purchase Right to such extent (or beneficial ownership of such shares of Common Stock as a result of such Purchase
Right to such extent) and such Purchase Right to such extent shall be held in abeyance for the Holder until such time, if ever, as its
right thereto would not result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation). To the extent that the issue price of such
Purchase Rights would result in an adjustment of the Conversion Price pursuant to
Section 7(c)
, such adjustment shall not occur
to the extent the Holders were granted the right to acquire such Purchase Rights on the applicable terms.
(e)
Pro Rata Distributions
. In addition to the requirements of
Section 3
, during such time as this Preferred Stock
is outstanding, if the Corporation declares or makes any dividend or other distribution of its assets (or rights to acquire its assets)
to holders of shares of Common Stock, by way of return of capital or otherwise (including, without limitation, any distribution of cash,
stock or other securities, property or options by way of a dividend, spin off, reclassification, corporate rearrangement, scheme of arrangement
or other similar transaction) (a “
Distribution
”), in each such case, the Holders shall be entitled to participate in
such Distribution to the same extent that the Holders would have participated therein if the Holder had held the number of shares of Common
Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of this Preferred Stock (without regard to any limitations on conversion hereof, including without
limitation, the Beneficial Ownership Limitation) immediately before the date of which a record is taken for such Distribution, or, if
no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of shares of Common Stock are to be determined for the participation
in such Distribution (
provided
,
however
, to the extent that the Holder’s right to participate in any
such Distribution would result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation, then the Holder shall not be entitled to participate
in such Distribution to such extent (or in the beneficial ownership of any shares of Common Stock as a result of such Distribution to
such extent) and the portion of such Distribution shall be held in abeyance for the benefit of the Holder until such time, if ever such
grant, issuance or sale, as its right thereto would not result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation).
(f)
Fundamental Transaction
.
(i)
If, at any time while this Preferred Stock is outstanding, (i) the Corporation, directly or indirectly, in one or more related
transactions effects any merger or consolidation of the Corporation with or into another Person, (ii) the Corporation (and all of its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole), directly or indirectly, effects any sale, lease, license, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition
of all or substantially all of its assets in one or a series of related transactions, (iii) any, direct or indirect, purchase offer, tender
offer or exchange offer (whether by the Corporation or another Person) is completed pursuant to which holders of Common Stock are permitted
to sell, tender or exchange their shares for other securities, cash or property and has been accepted by the holders of 50% or more of
the outstanding Common Stock or 50% or more of the voting power of the common equity of the Corporation, (iv) the Corporation, directly
or indirectly, in one or more related transactions effects any reclassification, reorganization or recapitalization of the Common Stock
or any compulsory share exchange pursuant to which the Common Stock is effectively converted into or exchanged for other securities, cash
or property (other than as a result of a stock split, combination or reclassification of shares of Common Stock covered by
Section 7(a)
),
or (v) the Corporation, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions consummates a stock or share purchase agreement or
other business combination (including, without limitation, a reorganization, recapitalization, spin-off or scheme of arrangement) with
another Person whereby such other Person acquires 50% or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock or 50% or more of the voting power
of the common equity of the Corporation, and such event(s) do not constitute a Deemed Liquidation Event (each a “
Fundamental
Transaction
”), then, upon any subsequent conversion of this Preferred Stock, the Holder shall have the right to receive, for
each Conversion Share that would have been issuable upon such conversion immediately prior to the occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction
(without regard to any limitation in
Section 6(d)
on the conversion of this Preferred Stock), the number of shares of capital
stock of the successor or acquiring corporation or of the Corporation, if it is the surviving corporation, and any additional consideration
(the “
Alternate Consideration
”) receivable as a result of such Fundamental Transaction by a holder of the number of
shares of Common Stock for which this Preferred Stock is convertible immediately prior to such Fundamental Transaction (without regard
to any limitation in
Section 6(d)
on the conversion of this Preferred Stock).
20
(ii)
For purposes of any such conversion, the determination of the Conversion Price shall be appropriately adjusted to apply to such
Alternate Consideration based on the amount of Alternate Consideration issuable in respect of one share of Common Stock in such Fundamental
Transaction, and the Corporation shall apportion the Conversion Price among the Alternate Consideration in a reasonable manner reflecting
the relative value of any different components of the Alternate Consideration. If holders of Common Stock are given any choice as to the
securities, cash or property to be received in a Fundamental Transaction, then the Holder shall be given the same choice as to the Alternate
Consideration it receives upon any conversion of this Preferred Stock following such Fundamental Transaction. To the extent necessary
to effectuate the foregoing provisions, any successor to the Corporation or surviving entity in such Fundamental Transaction shall file
a new Certificate of Designation with the same terms and conditions and issue to the Holders new preferred stock consistent with the foregoing
provisions and evidencing the Holders’ right to convert such preferred stock into Alternate Consideration.
(iii)
The Corporation shall cause any successor entity in a Fundamental Transaction in which the Corporation is not the survivor (the
“
Successor Entity
”) to assume in writing all of the obligations of the Corporation under this Certificate of Designation
and the Registration Rights Agreement in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 7(f)
pursuant to written agreements in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Required Holders and approved by the Required Holders (without unreasonable delay) prior
to such Fundamental Transaction and shall, at the option of the Holder of this Preferred Stock, deliver to the Holder in exchange for
this Preferred Stock a security of the Successor Entity evidenced by a written instrument substantially similar in form and substance
to this Preferred Stock which is convertible for a corresponding number of shares of capital stock of such Successor Entity (or its parent
entity) equivalent to the shares of Common Stock acquirable and receivable upon conversion of this Preferred Stock (without regard to
any limitations on the conversion of this Preferred Stock) prior to such Fundamental Transaction, and with a conversion price which applies
the Conversion Price hereunder to such shares of capital stock (but taking into account the relative value of the shares of Common Stock
pursuant to such Fundamental Transaction and the value of such shares of capital stock, such number of shares of capital stock and such
conversion price being for the purpose of protecting the economic value of this Preferred Stock immediately prior to the consummation
of such Fundamental Transaction), and which is reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Required Holders.
(g)
Calculations
. All calculations under this
Section 7
shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100th
of a share, as the case may be. For purposes of this
Section 7
, the number of shares of Common Stock deemed to be issued and
outstanding as of a given date shall be the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock (excluding any treasury shares of the Corporation)
issued and outstanding.
21
(h)
Notice to the Holders
.
(i)
Adjustment to Conversion Price
. Whenever the Conversion Price is adjusted pursuant to any provision of this
Section 7
,
the Corporation shall promptly deliver to each Holder by email a notice setting forth the Conversion Price after such adjustment and setting
forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment.
(ii)
Notice to Allow Conversion by Holder
. If (A) the Corporation shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution in whatever
form) on the Common Stock, (B) the Corporation shall declare a redemption of the Common Stock, (C) the Corporation shall authorize the
granting to all holders of the Common Stock of rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any shares of capital stock of any class
or of any rights, (D) the approval of any stockholders of the Corporation shall be required in connection with any reclassification of
the Common Stock, any consolidation or merger to which the Corporation is a party, any sale or transfer of all or substantially all of
the assets of the Corporation (and all of its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole), or any compulsory share exchange whereby the Common Stock
is converted into other securities, cash or property or (E) the Corporation shall authorize the voluntary or involuntary dissolution,
liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Corporation, then, in each case, the Corporation shall cause to be filed at each office
or agency maintained for the purpose of conversion of this Preferred Stock, and shall cause to be delivered by email to each Holder at
its email address as it shall appear upon the stock books of the Corporation, at least twenty (20) calendar days prior to the applicable
record or effective date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (x) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such
dividend, distribution, redemption, rights or warrants, or if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of the Common
Stock of record to be entitled to such dividend, distributions, redemption, rights or warrants are to be determined or (y) the date on
which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share exchange is expected to become effective or close, and the
date as of which it is expected that holders of the Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their shares of the Common Stock
for securities, cash or other property deliverable upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share exchange,
provided that
the failure to deliver such notice or any defect therein or in the delivery thereof shall not affect the validity
of the corporate action required to be specified in such notice. To the extent that any notice provided hereunder constitutes, or contains,
material, non-public information regarding the Corporation or any of the Subsidiaries, the Corporation shall simultaneously file such
notice with the Commission pursuant to a Current Report on Form 8-K, unless determined by the Corporation that such filing would be harmful
to the Corporation at such time, in which case the Corporation shall file such 8-K as soon as is reasonably practicable in its discretion.
For the avoidance of doubt, and without limiting the conversion rights of any Holder, each Holder shall remain entitled to convert the
Accrued Value of this Preferred Stock (or any part hereof) during the twenty (20)-day period commencing on the date of such notice through
the effective date of the event triggering such notice except as may otherwise be expressly set forth herein.

If, on the date of
such redemption, applicable law governing distributions to stockholders prevents the Corporation from redeeming all shares of Preferred
Stock scheduled to be redeemed, the Corporation shall be entitled to ratably redeem the maximum number of shares that it may redeem consistent
with such law and any Preferred Stock not so redeemed shall remain outstanding. The Corporation shall provide written notice (the “
Corporation
Notice
”) by e-mail and first class mail postage prepaid, to each Holder of record (determined at the close of business on the
Business Day next preceding the day on which the Corporation Notice is given) of the Preferred Stock to be redeemed, at the address last
shown on the records of the Corporation for such Holder, notifying such Holder of the redemption to be effected, specifying the number
of shares to be redeemed from such Holder, specifying the date of such redemption, the redemption price, the place at which payment may
be obtained and calling upon such Holder to surrender to the Corporation, in the manner and at the place designated, his, her or its certificate
or certificates representing the shares to be redeemed;
provided
that the date of redemption shall be not less than 15 days from
the date of the Corporation Notice. Except as otherwise provided herein, on or after the applicable date of redemption, each Holder to
be redeemed shall surrender to the Corporation the certificate or certificates representing such shares, in the manner and at the place
designated in the Corporation Notice, and thereupon the price of redemption of such shares shall be payable to the order of the person
whose name appears on such certificate or certificates as the owner thereof and each surrendered certificate shall be cancelled. In the
event less than all the shares represented by any such certificate are redeemed, a new certificate shall be issued representing the unredeemed
shares. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each Holder shall remain entitled to convert all or a portion of the Accrued
Value of its Preferred Stock (or any part thereof) at any time and from time to time during the 15-day period commencing on the date of
the Corporation Notice through the applicable date of redemption.
23
(b)
Redemption by the Holders
.
(i)
Unless prohibited by applicable law governing distribution to stockholders, shares of Preferred Stock shall be redeemed by the
Corporation at a purchase price equal to the Accrued Value (the “
Redemption Price
”), if at any time and from time to
time after the fifth (5
th
) anniversary of the Closing, a Holder delivers to the Corporation a written notice demanding redemption
of all of such Holder’s shares of Preferred Stock (the “
Redemption Request
”). The 20th day after the date of
the Corporation Notice shall be referred to as the “
Redemption Date
.” Upon receipt of a Redemption Request, the Corporation
shall apply all of its assets to any such redemption, and to no other corporate purpose, until the Redemption Price has been paid in full,
except to the extent prohibited by Delaware law governing distributions to stockholders.
(ii)
Following receipt of a Redemption Request, the Corporation shall send written notice of the mandatory redemption (the “
Redemption
Notice
”) to the redeeming Holder of record of Preferred Stock not less than 15 days prior to the Redemption Date. The Redemption
Notice shall state:
a.
the number of shares of Preferred Stock held by the Holder that the Corporation shall redeem on the Redemption Date;
b.
the Redemption Date and the Redemption Price;
c.
the date upon which the Holder’s right to convert such shares terminates; and
d.
for Holders of shares in certificated form, that the Holder is to surrender to the Corporation, in the manner and at the place designated,
his, her or its certificate or certificates representing the shares of Preferred Stock to be redeemed.
(iii)
On the Redemption Date, the Corporation shall redeem the Preferred Stock owned by such Holder. If on the Redemption Date Delaware
law governing distributions to stockholders prevents the Corporation from redeeming all shares of Preferred Stock to be redeemed, the
Corporation shall ratably redeem the maximum number of shares that it may redeem consistent with such law, and shall redeem the remaining
shares as soon as it may lawfully do so under such law. In the event that any portion of the Redemption Price has not been paid within
5 Business Days following the Redemption Date, interest on such unpaid portion of the Redemption Price shall accrue thereon until such
amount is paid in full at a rate equal to the lesser of (i) 24.0% per annum and (ii) the maximum rate permitted under applicable law.

if any, as may then be required pursuant to the DGCL and the Corporation’s certificate of incorporation; provided, however, and

Tax
Withholding
. The Corporation agrees that, provided that each Holder delivers to the Corporation a properly executed IRS Form W-9
or other certification satisfactory to the Corporation certifying as to such Holder’s status (or the status of such Holder’s
beneficial owner(s)) as a United States person (within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) and such Holder’s (or such
beneficial owners’) eligibility for complete exemption from backup withholding (“
U.S. Person Certification
”),
under current law the Corporation (including any paying agent of the Corporation) shall not be required to, and shall not, withhold on
any payments or deemed payments to any such Holder. In the event that any Holder fails to deliver to the Corporation such properly
executed U.S. Person Certification, the Corporation reasonably believes that a previously delivered U.S. Person Certification is no longer
accurate and/or valid, or there is a change in law that affects the withholding obligations of the Corporation, the Corporation and its
paying agent shall be entitled to withhold taxes on all payments made to the relevant Holder in the form of cash or otherwise treated,
in the Corporation’s reasonable discretion, as a dividend for U.S. federal tax purposes or to request that the relevant Holder
promptly pay the Corporation in cash any amounts required to satisfy any withholding tax obligations, in each case, to the extent the
Corporation or its paying agent determines in good faith it is required to deduct and withhold tax on payments to the relevant Holder
under applicable law;
provided, that the Corporation shall use commercially reasonable efforts to notify the relevant Holder of
any required withholding tax reasonably in advance of the date of the relevant payment
. In
the event that the Corporation does not have sufficient cash with respect to any Holder from withholding on cash payments otherwise payable
to such Holder and cash paid to the Corporation by such Holder to the Corporation pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, the
Corporation and its paying agent shall be entitled to withhold taxes on deemed payments, including distributions of additional Preferred
Stock in lieu of cash and constructive distributions on the Preferred Stock to the extent required by law, and the Corporation and its
paying agent shall be entitled to satisfy any required withholding tax on non-cash payments (including deemed payments) through a sale
of a portion of the Preferred Stock received as a dividend or from cash dividends or sales proceeds subsequently paid or credited on
the Preferred Stock.
(l)
Tax Treatment
. Absent a change in law, Internal Revenue Service practice or a contrary determination (as defined in Section
1313(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (the “
Code
”)), each holder of Preferred Stock and the Corporation
shall not treat the Preferred Stock (based on their terms as set forth in this Certificate of Designation) as “preferred stock”
within the meaning of Section 305 of the Code and Treasury Regulation Section 1.305-5 for United States federal income tax and withholding
tax purposes and shall not take any position inconsistent with such treatment.
