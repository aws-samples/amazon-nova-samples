make any investment permitted herein.

Section
2.5
at
2.0%
per annum
above the Interest Rate (other than with respect to any Advances outstanding, which shall accrue at the Interest Rate), payable on demand, from the date of such
43
nonpayment until such amount is paid in full (as well after as before judgment); provided
that, such interest rate shall not at any time exceed the maximum rate permitted by Applicable
Law. Any Obligation hereunder shall not be reduced by any distribution of any portion of Available Collections if at any time such distribution is rescinded or required to be returned by any Lender to the Borrower or any other Person for any reason.
Whenever any payment hereunder shall be stated to be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall in such case be included in the computation of payment of
Interest or any fee payable hereunder, as the case may be.
(c) If any Advance requested by the Borrower and approved by the
Administrative Agent pursuant to
Section
2.3
is not for any reason whatsoever, except as a result of the gross negligence or willful misconduct of, or failure to fund such Advance on the part of, the Lenders, the
Administrative Agent or an Affiliate thereof, made or effectuated, as the case may be, on the date specified therefor, the Borrower shall indemnify and hold harmless such Lender against any loss, cost or expense incurred by such Lender related
thereto (other than any such loss, cost or expense solely due to the gross negligence or willful misconduct or failure to fund such Advance on the part of the Lenders, the Administrative Agent or an Affiliate thereof), including, without limitation,
any loss (including cost of funds and reasonable
out-of-pocket
expenses), cost or expense incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of deposits or other
funds acquired by such Lender to fund Advances or maintain the Advances. Any such Lender shall provide to the Borrower documentation setting forth the amounts of any loss, cost or expense referred to in the previous sentence, such documentation to
be conclusive absent manifest error.

the benefit of the Obligors until remitted to the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.5(a). All amounts received by the Servicer with respect to the HCRE Loans may be deposited when received in a clearing account maintained by the Servicer with an

. (a) If, due to either (i) the introduction of or any change following the date hereof
(including any change by way of imposition or increase of reserve requirements) in or in the interpretation, administration or application following the date hereof of any Applicable Law (including any law or regulation resulting in any payments
paid to any Lender under this Agreement being subject to any Tax), in each case whether foreign or domestic or (ii) the compliance with any guideline or request following the date hereof from any central bank or other Governmental Authority
(whether or not having the force of law), there shall be any increase in the cost to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Affiliate, participant, successor or assign thereof (each of which shall be an “
Affected Party
”) of
agreeing to make or
46
making, funding or maintaining any Advance (or any reduction of the amount of any payment (whether of principal, interest, fee, compensation or otherwise) to any Affected Party hereunder), as the
case may be, or there shall be any reduction in the amount of any sum received or receivable by an Affected Party under this Agreement or under any other Transaction Document, the Borrower shall, from time to time, after written demand by the
Administrative Agent (which demand shall be accompanied by a statement setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for such demand), on behalf of such Affected Party, pay to the Administrative Agent, on behalf of such Affected Party, additional
amounts sufficient to compensate such Affected Party for such increased costs or reduced payments within ten (10) days following the Borrower’s receipt of such demand.
(b) If either (i) the introduction of or any change following the date hereof in or in the interpretation, administration or application
following the date hereof of any law, guideline, rule or regulation, directive or request or (ii) the compliance by any Affected Party with any law, guideline, rule, regulation, directive or request following the date hereof, from any central
bank, any Governmental Authority or agency, including compliance by an Affected Party with any request or directive regarding capital adequacy, but, in each case, excluding Taxes, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on the
capital of any Affected Party, as a consequence of its obligations hereunder or any related document or arising in connection herewith or therewith to a level below that which any such Affected Party could have achieved but for such introduction,
change or compliance (taking into consideration the policies of such Affected Party with respect to capital adequacy), by an amount deemed by such Affected Party to be material, then, from time to time, after demand by such Affected Party (which
demand shall be accompanied by a statement setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for such demand), the Borrower shall pay the Administrative Agent on behalf of such Affected Party such additional amounts as will compensate such Affected Party
for such reduction. For the avoidance of doubt, any increase in cost and/or reduction in Interest with respect to any Affected Party caused by regulatory capital allocation adjustments due to FAS 166/167 or ASC 810 and subsequent statements and
interpretations shall constitute a circumstance on which such Affected Party may base a claim for reimbursement under this
Section
2.7
.
(c) In determining any amount provided for in this
Section
2.7
, the Affected Party may use any reasonable averaging
and attribution methods. The Administrative Agent, on behalf of any Affected Party making a claim under this
Section
2.7
, shall submit to the Borrower a certificate setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for and the
computations of such additional or increased costs, which certificate shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Failure or delay on the part of any Affected Party to demand compensation pursuant to this
Section
2.7
shall
not constitute a waiver of such Affected Party’s right to demand or receive such compensation.
(d) Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, (i) the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and all rules and regulations promulgated thereunder or issued in connection therewith and (ii) all requests, rules, guidelines, requirements and directives
promulgated by the Bank for International Settlements, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (or any successor or similar authority) or the United States or foreign regulatory authorities, in each case pursuant to Basel III, shall in each case
be deemed to have been introduced after the Closing Date, thereby constituting a demonstrable change for which a claim for increased costs or additional amounts may be made hereunder with respect to the Affected Parties, regardless of the date
enacted, adopted or issued.
47
2.8
Taxes
.
(a) All payments made by or on account of any obligation of the Borrower, contemplated in this Agreement, will be made free and clear of and
without deduction or withholding for or on account of any Taxes, except as required by Applicable Law. If any Taxes are required to be withheld from any amounts payable to any Lender or the Administrative Agent (including such deductions and
withholdings applicable to Additional Amounts payable under this Section), then (i) the amount payable to such Person will be increased (the amount of such increase, the “
Additional Amount
”) by the Borrower such that the
Lender or Administrative Agent, as applicable, receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made and (ii) the Borrower shall timely pay the full amount withheld to the relevant
Governmental Authority in accordance with Applicable Law. The foregoing obligation to pay Additional Amounts with respect to payments required to be made by the Borrower under this Agreement will not, however, apply with respect to Taxes that are
imposed on or measured by net income (however denominated) or that are franchise Taxes or branch profits Taxes imposed on any Lender or the Administrative Agent (i) by the jurisdiction (or any political subdivision thereof) under the laws of
which such Lender or the Administrative Agent is organized or in which its principal office is located, or in the case of any Lender, in which its applicable lending office is located or (ii) by any other jurisdiction as a result of a present
or former connection between such Lender or the Administrative Agent and the jurisdiction imposing such Tax (other than any connection arising from the Lender or the Administrative Agent having executed, delivered, or performed its obligations or
received payments under, or enforced this Agreement) (“
Excluded
Taxes
”).
(b) The Borrower will indemnify each
Lender and the Administrative Agent for the full amount of Taxes, other than Excluded Taxes, payable or paid by such Person in respect of Taxes (including Additional Amounts) with respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of an
Obligor hereunder or under any other Transaction Documents, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. All payments in respect of this indemnification shall be made within ten
(10) days following the date a written invoice therefor is delivered to the Borrower.
(c) Within thirty (30) days after the
date of any payment by the Borrower of any Taxes, the Borrower will furnish to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders at the applicable address set forth on this Agreement, evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent of payment
thereof.
(d) The Administrative Agent and each Lender that is a United States person as that term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30)
of the Code hereby agrees that it shall deliver, no later than the date upon which such Lender becomes a party hereto, two accurate, complete and signed copies (one to the Borrower and one to the Administrative Agent, with a copy to the Collateral
Custodian) of U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form
W-9
or any successor form, certifying that such Lender is, on the date of delivery thereof, entitled to an exemption from U.S. backup withholding tax. Each
Lender that is organized under the laws of a jurisdiction outside the United States shall, no later than the date on which such Lender becomes a party hereto, deliver two properly completed and duly executed copies (one to the Borrower and one to
the Administrative Agent) of any applicable U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form
W-8BEN,
W-8BEN-E,
W-8ECI
or
W-8IMY
48
or any subsequent versions thereof or successors thereto, in each case to the extent legally entitled to do so, claiming a reduction of or complete exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax. In
addition, in the case of a Lender claiming exemption from U.S. federal withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code, such Lender will represent to Borrower in a form reasonably acceptable to Borrower that it is not a bank for
purposes of Section 881(c) of the Code, is not a
10-percent
shareholder (within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Code) of the Borrower and is not a controlled foreign corporation related to
the Borrower (within the meaning of Section 864(d)(4) of the Code), and such Lender will promptly notify the Borrower in the event any such representation is no longer accurate. Such forms shall be delivered by each Lender on or before the date
it becomes a party to this Agreement or participant herein and on or before the date, if any, such Lender designates a new lending office. In addition, each Lender agrees that, from time to time after the Closing Date, it shall deliver the forms
described above, as applicable, as promptly as practicable after receipt of a reasonable written request therefor from the Borrower or the Administrative Agent.
(e) Without prejudice to the survival of any other agreement of the Borrower hereunder, the agreements and obligations of the Borrower
contained in this
Section
2.8
shall survive the termination of this Agreement.
2.9
Continuing Authority of
Authorized Representatives
. The Administrative Agent is authorized to rely upon the continuing authority of the Persons hereafter designated by Borrower (“
Authorized Representatives
”) to bind Borrower with respect to all
matters pertaining to the Transaction Documents, including, but not limited to, the submission of requests for Advances, and certificates with regard thereto, instructions with regard to the Collection Account and, to the extent permitted under this
Agreement, the Collateral, and matters pertaining to the procedures and documentation for Advances. Such authorization may be changed only upon written Notice to the Administrative Agent accompanied by evidence, reasonably satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent, of the authority of the Person giving such Notice and such Notice shall be effective not sooner than five (5) Business Days following receipt thereof by the Administrative Agent. The Authorized Representatives as of the
Closing Date are listed on

Authorized Representative is a responsible and senior official of Borrower.

.
(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, if the Administrative Agent determines prior to the
relevant Reference Time that a Benchmark Transition Event and its related Benchmark Replacement Date have occurred with respect to the then-current Benchmark, the Benchmark Replacement will replace the then-current Benchmark for all purposes
relating to this Agreement in respect of all determinations on such date and for all determinations on all subsequent dates without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement.
49
(b) In connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement, the Administrative
Agent will have the right to make Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes from time to time. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or in any other Transaction Documents, any amendments to this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents implementing such Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes will become effective and binding on Borrower upon notice by the Administrative Agent to Borrower without the necessity of any action by or consent of any other party.
(c) Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Agreement, including any
determination with respect to administrative feasibility (whether due to technical, administrative or operational issues), a tenor, a rate, an adjustment or the occurrence or
non-occurrence
of an event,
circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any selection, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error, and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the documentation relating to this Agreement,
will become effective without consent from any other party. Each such determination, decision and election will be in the Administrative Agent’s sole discretion.
(d) The Administrative Agent will promptly provide notice to the Borrower of (i) any Benchmark Replacement Date and the related Benchmark
Replacement, (ii) the effectiveness of any Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes, and (iii) the removal or reinstatement of any tenor of a Benchmark. For the avoidance of doubt, any notice required to be delivered by the Administrative
Agent as set forth herein may be provided, at the option of the Administrative Agent (in its sole discretion), in one or more notices and may be delivered together with, or as part of any amendment which implements any Benchmark Replacement or
Benchmark Replacement Conforming Changes.
(e) The Administrative Agent does not warrant or accept any responsibility for, and shall not
have any liability with respect to (i) the administration, submission or any other matter related to SOFR or with respect to any alternative or successor rate thereto, or replacement rate thereof (including, without limitation any Benchmark
Replacement implemented hereunder), (ii) the composition or characteristics of any Benchmark Replacement, including whether it is similar to, or produces the same value or economic equivalence to SOFR (or any other Benchmark) or have the same volume
or liquidity as did SOFR (or any other Benchmark), (iii) any actions or use of its discretion or other decisions or determinations made with respect to any matters covered by this
Section

limitation, whether or not a Benchmark Transition Event has occurred, the removal or lack thereof of unavailable or
non-representative
tenors, the implementation or lack thereof of any Benchmark Replacement
Conforming Changes, the delivery or

Section
2.10

2.11
Defaulting Lender
. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as that Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law:
(a) Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of that Defaulting Lender
(whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, or otherwise), shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows:
first
, to the payment of any amounts owing by that Defaulting Lender to the
Administrative Agent hereunder;
second
, as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Advance in respect of which that
50
Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent;
third
, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and
the Borrower, to be held in a
non-interest
bearing deposit account and released in order to satisfy obligations of that Defaulting Lender to fund Advances under this Agreement;
fourth
, to the payment of
any amounts owing to the Lenders a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement;
fifth
, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by such Borrower against that Defaulting Lender as a result
of that Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and
sixth
, to that Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction;
provided
that, if such payment is a payment of the
principal amount of any Advances in respect of which that Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, such payment shall be applied solely to pay the Advances of all
non-Defaulting
Lenders on
a
pro rata
basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Advances of that Defaulting Lender. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting
Lender or to post cash collateral pursuant to this
Section
2.11
shall be deemed paid to and redirected by that Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.
(b) Reserved.
(c) For any
period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender, that Defaulting Lender shall not be entitled to receive any Fees owed to such Lender for any period during which that Lender is a Defaulting Lender (and the Borrower shall not be required to
pay any such fee that otherwise would have been required to have been paid to such Defaulting Lender).
(d) If the Administrative Agent
agrees in writing in their sole discretion that a Defaulting Lender should no longer be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and
subject to any conditions set forth therein (which may include arrangements with respect to any cash collateral), that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase that portion of outstanding Advances of the other Lenders or take such other
actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Advances to be held on a
pro rata
basis by the Lenders in accordance with their Pro Rata Shares, whereupon that Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender;
provided
that, no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrowers while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and
provided further
that, except to the extent
otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.
2.12
Additional Lenders

Increases in Facility Amount

Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrower shall have the right, at any time, with the consent of the Administrative
Agent and the Required Lenders, to increase the Maximum Facility Amount by up to an additional amount of $415,000,000, with the minimum increase being $25,000,000 (or such lesser amount to the extent that the total amount of any remaining potential
increase to the Maximum Facility Amount hereunder is less than $25,000,000) at any one time. The following terms and conditions shall apply to any such increase: (i) any such increase shall be obtained from existing Lenders or from other
Permitted Assignees acceptable to the Administrative Agent (acting in its sole discretion), in each case in accordance with the terms set forth below; (ii) the Commitment of any Lender may not be increased without the prior written consent of
such Lender; (iii) the Borrower and Lenders providing such increased or new Commitments shall execute an acknowledgement (or in the case of the addition of a bank or other financial institution not then a party to this Agreement, a joinder
agreement) in form and content satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower to reflect the revised Commitments and Maximum Facility Amount (which acknowledgement (or joinder agreement) shall not (x) increase the Commitment of a
Lender without such Lender’s consent or (y) amend this Agreement or the other Loan Documents other than as provided for in this
Section
2.13
); (iv) the Borrower shall execute such Notes as are necessary to
reflect the increase in or creation of the Commitments; (v) if any Advances are outstanding at the time of any such increase, the Lenders, as directed by the Administrative Agent, shall make such payments and adjustments on the Advances amongst
themselves as necessary to give effect to the revised commitment percentages of the Lenders and cause all Advances to be held ratably by the Lenders after giving effect to such increased Commitments; (vi) the Borrower may solicit commitments
from Permitted Assignees that are not then a party to this Agreement so long as such Permitted Assignees are acceptable to the Administrative Agent (acting in its sole discretion) execute a joinder agreement in form and content satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent and the Borrower; (vii) the conditions set forth in
Section
3.2
shall be satisfied in all material respects; (viii) after giving effect to any such increase in the Maximum Facility Amount, no
Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; (ix) the Borrower shall have provided to the Administrative Agent, at least five (5) Business Days prior to such proposed increase in the Maximum Facility Amount, written
evidence demonstrating the Guarantor’s pro forma compliance with
Section
12.9
after giving effect to such proposed increase, such evidence to be satisfactory in the sole discretion of the Administrative Agent and
(x) the Borrower shall have paid any fees due and owing pursuant to the terms of the Customers Fee Letter concurrently with the increase of the Maximum Facility Amount. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the amount of
any increase in the Maximum Facility Amount hereunder shall be offered first to the existing Lenders, and the failure of any existing Lender to respond within five (5) Business Days of such offer shall be deemed to constitute a refusal by such
Lender to increase its Commitment with no further right of first offer. In the event the additional commitments which existing Lenders are willing to take shall exceed the amount requested by the Borrower, such excess shall be allocated in
proportion to the commitments of such existing Lenders willing to take additional commitments. If the amount of the additional commitments requested by the Borrower shall exceed the additional commitments which the existing Lenders are willing to
take, then the Borrower may invite other Permitted Assignees acceptable to the Administrative Agent (acting in its sole discretion) to join this Agreement as Lenders hereunder for the portion of commitments not taken by existing Lenders; provided
that such Permitted Assignees shall enter into such joinder agreements to give
52
effect thereto as the Administrative Agent and the Borrower may reasonably request. Unless otherwise agreed by the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and the Lenders, the terms of any increase in
the Maximum Facility Amount shall be the same as those in effect prior to any increase; provided, however, that should the terms of the increase agreed to be other than those in effect prior to the increase, then the Loan Documents shall, with the
consent of the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and the Lenders, be amended to the extent necessary to incorporate any such different terms. For the avoidance of doubt, any increase in the Facility Amount pursuant to this
Section
2.13
may be effected by an increase in the Commitment of the Administrative Agent, in its capacity as a Lender.

7.2
Remedies
.
(a) If an Event of Default described in
Section
7.1(g)
occurs with respect to Borrower, the Commitment will
automatically terminate as to Borrower, and the unpaid principal amount of and accrued interest on Borrower’s Note and all other Obligations of Borrower will automatically become due and payable at the Default Rate, without presentment, demand
or other Notice or requirements of any kind, all of which Borrower expressly waives.
(b) If any other Event of Default continues beyond
any applicable notice and/or cure period, the Administrative Agent, by Notice to Borrower, may terminate all or any portion of the Commitment and declare the Obligations to be immediately due and payable.
(c) If any Event of Default continues beyond any applicable notice and/or cure period, the Administrative Agent, may, also take any of the
following actions:
(i) Foreclose upon or otherwise enforce its security interest in any Lien on the Collateral to secure all payments and
performance of the Obligations in any manner permitted by law.
(ii) Notify all Obligors under any of the Collateral that the Collateral
has been assigned to the Administrative Agent (or to another Person designated by the Administrative Agent) and that all payments on that Collateral are to be made directly to the Administrative Agent (or such other Person); settle, compromise or
release, in whole or in part, any amounts any obligor owes on any of the Collateral on terms acceptable to the Administrative Agent; enforce payment and prosecute any action or proceeding involving any of the Collateral; and where any Collateral is
in default, foreclose on and enforce any Liens securing that Collateral in any manner permitted by law and sell any property acquired as a result of those enforcement actions.
(iii) Act, or contract with a third party to act, at Borrower’s expense, as servicer or subservicer of Collateral of Borrower requiring
servicing, and perform all obligations required under any Collateral of Borrower, including Servicing Contracts.
(iv) Require Borrower
and the Servicer to assemble and make available to the Administrative Agent the Collateral and all related books and records at a place designated by the Administrative Agent or its designee.
(v) Before the disposition of the Collateral, prepare it for disposition in any manner and to the extent the Administrative Agent deems
appropriate.
(vi) Exercise all rights and remedies of a secured creditor under the UCC or other Applicable Law, including selling or
otherwise disposing of all or any portion of the Collateral at one or more public or private sales, whether or not such Collateral is present at the place of sale, for cash or credit or future delivery, on terms and conditions and in the manner as
the Administrative Agent may determine. Borrower waives any right it may have to prior notice of the sale of all or any portion of the Collateral to the extent allowed by Applicable Law. If notice is required under Applicable Law, the Administrative
Agent will give Borrower not less than ten (10) days’ notice of any public sale or of the date after which any private sale may be held.
85
Borrower agrees that ten (10) days’ notice is reasonable notice. The Administrative Agent may, without notice or publication, adjourn any public or private sale one or more times by
announcement at the time and place fixed for the sale, and the sale may be held at any time or place announced at the adjournment. In the case of a sale of all or any portion of the Collateral on credit or for future delivery, such Collateral sold
on those terms may be retained by the Administrative Agent until the purchaser pays the selling price or takes possession of such Collateral. The Administrative Agent has no liability to Borrower if a purchaser fails to pay for or take possession of
Collateral sold on those terms, and in the case of any such failure, the Administrative Agent may sell the Collateral again upon notice complying with this
Section
7.2
.
(vii) Instead of or in conjunction with exercising the power of sale authorized by
Section
7.2(c)(vi)
, the
Administrative Agent may proceed by suit at law or in equity to collect all amounts due on the Collateral, or to foreclose the Administrative Agent’s Lien on and sell all or any portion of such Collateral pursuant to a judgment or decree of a
court of competent jurisdiction.
(viii) Proceed against Borrower on any Note.
(ix) Retain all excess proceeds from the sale or other disposition of the Collateral, and apply them to the payment of the Obligations of
Borrower under
Section
7.3
.
(d) The Administrative Agent will incur no liability as a result of the
commercially reasonable sale or other disposition of all or any portion of the Collateral at any public or private sale or other disposition. Borrower waives (to the extent permitted by law) any claims it may have against the Administrative Agent
arising by reason of the fact that the price at which the Collateral may have been sold at a private sale was less than the price that the Administrative Agent might have obtained at a public sale, or was less than the aggregate amount of the
Advances Outstanding, accrued and unpaid interest on those Advances, and unpaid fees, even if the Administrative Agent accepts the first offer received and does not offer the Collateral to more than one offeree. Borrower agrees that any sale of
Collateral by the Administrative Agent, or any other disposition of Collateral arranged by the Administrative Agent after the occurrence of an Event of Default, will be deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner.
(e) Reserved.
(f) Borrower
specifically waives and releases (to the extent permitted by law) any equity or right of redemption, stay or appraisal that Borrower has or may have under any rule of law or statute now existing or adopted after the date of this Agreement, and any
right to require the Administrative Agent to (i) proceed against any Person, (ii) proceed against or exhaust any of the Collateral or pursue its rights and remedies against the Collateral in any particular order, or (iii) pursue any
other remedy within its power. The Administrative Agent is not required to take any action to preserve any rights of Borrower against holders of mortgages having priority to the Lien of any Mortgage or Security Agreement included in the Collateral
or to preserve Borrower’s rights against other prior parties.
86
(g) The Administrative Agent may, but is not obligated to, advance any sums or do any act or
thing necessary to uphold or enforce the Lien and priority of, or the security intended to be afforded by, any Mortgage or Security Agreement included in the Collateral, including payment of delinquent Taxes or assessments and insurance premiums.
All advances, charges, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys’ fees and disbursements, incurred or paid by the Administrative Agent in exercising any right, power or remedy conferred by this Agreement, or in the enforcement of this
Agreement, together with interest on those amounts at the Default Rate, from the time paid by the Administrative Agent until repaid by Borrower, are deemed to be principal outstanding under this Agreement and the Note.
(h) No failure or delay on the part of the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Custodian to exercise any right, power or remedy provided in
this Agreement or under any other Transaction Document, at law or in equity, will operate as a waiver of that right, power or remedy. No single or partial exercise by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Custodian of any right, power or remedy
provided under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, at law or in equity, precludes any other or further exercise of that right, power, or remedy by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Custodian or the Administrative Agent’s
or Collateral Custodian’s exercise of any other right, power or remedy. Without limiting the foregoing, Borrower hereby expressly waives and releases to the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law, the pleading of any statute of limitations
as a defense to payment of the Obligations or performance of its obligations hereunder, under the Note, or the other Transaction Documents. The rights, powers and remedies of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Custodian under this Agreement
or any other Transaction Document shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any other right, power or remedy which the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Custodian may have against Borrower pursuant to this Agreement, the Note, or the other
Transaction Documents or existing at law or in equity or otherwise. The Administrative Agent’s or the Collateral Custodian’s rights, powers and remedies may be pursued singularly, concurrently or otherwise, at such time and in such order
as the Administrative Agent may determine in the Administrative Agent’s or the Collateral Custodian’s sole discretion, as applicable. No delay or omission to exercise any remedy, right or power accruing upon an Event of Default shall
impair any such remedy, right or power or shall be construed as a waiver thereof, but any such remedy, right or power may be exercised from time to time and as often as may be deemed expedient. A waiver of one Default or Event of Default with
respect to Borrower shall not be construed to be a waiver of any subsequent Default or Event of Default by Borrower or to impair any remedy, right or power consequent thereon.
(i) Upon the occurrence of a Servicer Removal Event, the Borrower agrees that, notwithstanding anything herein or in any Transaction Document
to the contrary, the Administrative Agent, by written notice to the Servicer, shall have the sole right to terminate all of the rights and obligations of the Servicer under the Servicing Contract and that the Administrative Agent shall have the sole
right to appoint a replacement servicer, and such replacement shall accept its appointment by a written assumption in a form acceptable to the Administrative Agent. Upon its appointment, the replacement servicer, shall be the successor in all
respects to the Servicer with respect to servicing functions under the Servicing Contract, which may be documented pursuant to a separate Servicing Contract in a form acceptable to the Administrative Agent;
provided
that, the replacement
servicer, shall have (i) no liability with respect to any action performed by the terminated Servicer prior to the date that the replacement servicer, becomes the successor to the Servicer or any claim of a third party based on any alleged
action or inaction of the terminated Servicer, (ii) no obligation to perform any advancing or origination obligations including responsibility for any eligibility representations related to the
87
HCRE Loans, (iii) no obligation to pay any Taxes required to be paid by the Servicer, (iv) no obligation to pay any of the fees and expenses of any other party to the transactions
contemplated hereby, and (v) no liability or obligation with respect to any Servicer indemnification obligations of any prior Servicer, including the original Servicer. The indemnification obligations of the replacement Servicer, upon becoming
a replacement Servicer, are expressly limited to those arising on account of its failure to act in good faith and with reasonable care under the circumstances.
7.3
Application of Proceeds
. Any amounts received from any sale or liquidation of the Collateral pursuant to this
Article VII
in
excess of the Obligations will be applied by the Administrative Agent in accordance with the provisions of
Section
2.6
, or as a court of competent jurisdiction may otherwise direct.
7.4
Administrative Agent Appointed
Attorney-in-Fact
.
Borrower appoints the Administrative Agent its
attorney-in-fact,
with full power of substitution, for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this Agreement, the
Note and the other Transaction Documents and taking any action and executing any instruments that the Administrative Agent deems necessary or advisable to accomplish that purpose. Borrower’s appointment of the Administrative Agent as
attorney-in-fact
is irrevocable and coupled with an interest. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent may give notice of its Lien on the
Collateral to any Person, either in Borrower’s name or in its own name, endorse all HCRE Loans payable to the order of Borrower, change or cause to be changed the book-entry registration or name of subscriber on any Collateral, prepare and
submit for filing Uniform Commercial Code amendment statements with respect to any Uniform Commercial Code financing statements filed in connection with any item of Collateral or receive, endorse and collect all checks made payable to the order of

Administrative Agent agrees not to exercise the foregoing power of attorney except after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default.
7.5
Right of
Set-Off
. Borrower hereby Grants to Administrative Agent and the Lenders, a
continuing lien, security interest and right of setoff as security for all liabilities and obligations of Borrower to Administrative Agent, whether now existing or hereafter arising, upon and against all deposits, credits, collateral and property of
Borrower, now or hereafter in the possession, custody safekeeping or control of Administrative Agent or any entity under the control of Administrative Agent (and with respect to Administrative Agent, all deposits, credits, collateral and property,
now or hereafter in the possession, custody safekeeping or control Administrative Agent or any other entity under control of Administrative Agent) and its successors and assigns or in transit to any of them, except for any accounts being held by
Borrower in trust or in escrow solely for the benefit of one or more third parties that are not Affiliates of Borrower and in which Borrower has no ownership or beneficial interest. At any time upon or after the occurrence and during the continuance
of an Event of Default, without demand or notice (any such notice being expressly waived by Borrower), Administrative Agent may setoff the same or any part thereof and apply the same to any liability or obligation of Borrower even though unmatured
and regardless of the adequacy of any other Collateral of Borrower securing the Advances. ANY AND ALL RIGHTS TO REQUIRE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT TO EXERCISE ITS RIGHTS OR REMEDIES WITH RESPECT TO ANY OTHER COLLATERAL OF BORROWER WHICH SECURES THE LOAN,
PRIOR TO EXERCISING ITS RIGHT OF SETOFF WITH RESPECT TO SUCH DEPOSITS, CREDITS OR OTHER PROPERTY OF BORROWER, ARE HEREBY KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVED.

exercise such powers under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof and thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision
to the contrary contained elsewhere in this Agreement or in any other Transaction Document, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or responsibilities, except those expressly set forth in this Agreement, nor shall the Administrative
Agent have or be deemed to have any fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Transaction Document or otherwise

implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any Applicable Law. Instead, such term is used merely as a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent
contracting parties.

other Transaction Document by or through agents, employees or attorneys in fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or

Transaction Documents by acting upon any notice (including notice by telephone), consent, certificate or other instrument or writing (which may be by facsimile) believed by it to be genuine and signed or sent by the proper party or parties.
(d)
Actions by Administrative Agent
. The Administrative Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing to take any action under
this Agreement or any other Transaction Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of the Lenders as it deems appropriate and, if it so requests, it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders against any and
all liability and expense which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Administrative Agent shall in all cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this Agreement or any
other Transaction Document in accordance with a request or consent of the Lenders;
provided
that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action hereunder if the taking of
such action, in the reasonable determination of the Administrative Agent, shall be in violation of any Applicable Law or contrary to any provision of this Agreement or shall expose the Administrative Agent to liability hereunder or otherwise. In the
event the Administrative Agent requests the consent of a Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions and the Administrative Agent does not receive a response (either positive or negative) from such Lender within ten (10) Business Days of such
Lender’s receipt of such request, then such Lender shall be deemed to have declined to consent to the relevant action.
(e)
Notice of Event of Default, Default or Servicer Removal Event
. The Administrative Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of the occurrence of an Event of Default, Default or Servicer Removal Event, unless the Administrative
Agent has received written notice from a Lender, the Borrower or the Servicer referring to this Agreement, describing such Event of Default, Default or Servicer Removal Event and stating that such notice is a “Notice of Event of
Default,” “Notice of Default” or “Notice of Servicer Removal Event,” as applicable. The Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to such Event of Default, Default or Servicer Removal Event as may be
requested by the Lender acting jointly or as the Administrative Agent shall deem advisable or in the best interest of the Lenders.
(f)
Credit Decision with Respect to the Administrative Agent
. Each Lender and each Secured Party acknowledges that none of the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates has made any representation or warranty to it, and that no act by the
Administrative Agent hereinafter taken, including any consent to and acceptance of any assignment or review of the affairs of the Borrower, the Servicer or any of their respective Affiliates or review or approval of any of the Collateral, shall be
deemed to constitute any representation or warranty by any of the Administrative Agent or its Affiliates to any Lender as to any matter, including whether the Administrative Agent has disclosed material information in its possession. Each Lender and
each Secured Party acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the

Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under this Agreement. After any retiring Administrative Agent’s resignation hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this
Article VIII
shall continue
to inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative Agent under this Agreement.

Succession of Administrative Agent upon Payment of Obligations

and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and Customers Bank shall be discharged from its duties and obligations as Administrative Agent under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. If no such successor Administrative Agent shall
have been so appointed, and shall have accepted such appointment, within thirty (30) days after the retiring Administrative Agent’s giving of notice of resignation or the removal of the retiring Administrative Agent, then the retiring
Administrative Agent may appoint a successor Administrative Agent which successor Administrative Agent shall be either (i) a commercial bank organized under the laws of the United States or of any state thereof and have a combined capital and
surplus of at least $50,000,000 or (ii) an Affiliate of such a bank. Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor Administrative Agent, such successor Administrative Agent shall thereupon succeed to
and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations under this Agreement. After any retiring
Administrative Agent’s resignation or removal hereunder as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this
Article VIII
shall continue to inure to its benefit as to any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Administrative
Agent under this Agreement.

guaranty set forth in this
Article XII
and the other provisions set forth in this Article are referred to herein as the “
Guaranty
.”
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Guarantor’s liability shall extend to all amounts that constitute part of the
Guarantied Obligations that would be owed by Borrower under or in respect of the Transaction Documents but for the fact that they are unenforceable or not allowable due to the existence of a bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding involving
Borrower.
Guarantor and, by its acceptance of this Guaranty, each Lender hereby confirms that it is the intention of all such persons
that this Guaranty and the obligations of Guarantor hereunder not constitute a fraudulent transfer or conveyance for purposes of any Bankruptcy Law, the Uniform Fraudulent Conveyance Act, the Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act or any similar foreign,
federal or state law to the extent applicable to this Guaranty and the obligations of Guarantor hereunder.
107
To effectuate the foregoing intention, each Lender and Guarantor hereby irrevocably agree that the obligations of Guarantor under this Guaranty at any time shall be limited to the maximum amount
as will result in the obligations of Guarantor under this Guaranty not constituting a fraudulent transfer or conveyance.

incurred or expended by the Administrative Agent or any Lender in connection with the Guarantied Obligations, this Guaranty and the enforcement thereof, together with interest on amounts recoverable under this Guaranty from the time such amounts
become due until payment, at the rate
per annum
equal to the Default Rate. Such costs shall include any reasonable costs and expenses of the Administrative Agent or any Lender (or a third party designated any by such party) if the
Administrative Agent, in its sole and absolute discretion, elects to exercise its rights under the Transaction Documents after an Event of Default to take control of and perform and pay the Guarantied Obligations (or cause a third party to perform
and pay the Guarantied Obligations).
12.3
Waiver of Demands, Notices, Diligence, etc
.
Guarantor hereby assents to all of
the terms and conditions of the Guarantied Obligations and waives: (a) demand for the payment of the principal of any Guarantied Obligation or of any claim for interest or any part of any thereof; (b) notice of the occurrence of a default
or an event of default under any Guarantied Obligation; (c) protest of the nonpayment of the principal of any Guarantied Obligation or of any claim for interest or any part thereof; (d) notice of presentment, demand and protest;
(e) notice of acceptance of any guaranty herein provided for or of the terms and provisions thereof or hereof by the Administrative Agent or any Lender; (f) notice of any indulgences or extensions granted to Borrower or any successor to
Borrower or any person or party which shall have assumed the obligations of Borrower; (g) any requirement of diligence or promptness on the part of the Administrative Agent or any Lender in the enforcement of any of its rights under the
provisions of any Guarantied Obligation or this Guaranty; (h) any enforcement of any Guarantied Obligation; (i) any right which Guarantor might have to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to proceed against any other guarantor
of the Guarantied Obligations or to realize on any collateral security therefor; and (j) any and all notices of every kind and description which may be required to be given by any statute or rule of law in any jurisdiction. Guarantor
acknowledges and agrees that neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender has any obligation to marshal any assets in favor of Guarantor, or against or in payment of (i) any of the Guaranteed Obligations or (ii) any other obligation
owed to the Administrative Agent or any Lender by Guarantor, Borrower or any other Person.
12.4
Obligations of Guarantor
Unconditional
. The obligations of Guarantor under this Guaranty shall be unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or enforceability of any Guarantied Obligation, and shall not be affected by any action taken under any Guarantied
Obligation in the exercise of any right or remedy therein conferred, or by any failure or omission on the part of the Administrative Agent to enforce any right given thereunder or hereunder or any remedy conferred thereby or hereby, or by any waiver
of any term, covenant, agreement or
108
condition of any Guarantied Obligation or this Guaranty, or by any release of any security or any other guaranty at any time existing for the benefit of any Guarantied Obligation or any other
obligation of Borrower to the Administrative Agent or any Lender under the Transaction Documents, or by any action of the Administrative Agent or any Lender granting indulgence or extension to, or waiving or acquiescing in any default by, Borrower
or any successor to Borrower or any person or party which shall have assumed its obligations, or by reason of any disability or other defense of Borrower or any successor to Borrower, it being the purpose and intent of Guarantor that the obligations
of Guarantor hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances and shall not be discharged except by payment or performance as herein provided, and then only to the extent of such payment or performance. This Guaranty is
an absolute, unconditional and continuing guaranty of the full and punctual payment and performance of the Guarantied Obligations and not of their collectability only.

execution and delivery of this Guaranty and this Agreement (and each substitute Guarantor shall make and/or reaffirm the same):

managers or members required by law, by its Constituent Documents or otherwise) to authorize the execution, delivery and performance hereof and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.
(c) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party, nor the consummation of
any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby nor compliance by Guarantor with any of the terms and provisions hereof or thereof will conflict with, or result in a breach of any of the terms, conditions or provisions of, or constitute a
default under, or result in any violation of, or result in the creation of any lien upon any of the properties or assets of Guarantor pursuant to its Constituent Documents or any Applicable Law, statute, rule, regulation or award of any arbitrator
or any agreement, instrument, order, judgment or decree to which Guarantor is a party or to which it or its properties are subject or by which they may be bound.
(d) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party, nor the consummation of
any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby requires any consent, approval or authorization of, or filing, recording, registration or qualification by Guarantor with, any court or governmental or administrative body or authority.
109
(e) Guarantor has duly executed and delivered each of the Transaction Documents to which it
is a party, and each of such Transaction Documents constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation enforceable against it in accordance with the respective terms thereof, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency and similar laws of general application
affecting the rights and remedies of creditors and, with respect to the availability of the remedies of specific enforcement, subject to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor may be brought.
(f) There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending or threatened against Guarantor before any court or any governmental, administrative,
regulatory, adjudicatory or arbitrational body or agency of any kind which, if decided adversely, could reasonably be expected to adversely affect performance by Guarantor of such Guarantor’s obligations pursuant to and as contemplated by the
terms and provisions of this Guaranty and this Agreement.
(g) Guarantor has independently and based on such documents and information as
it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into the Transaction Documents to which it is a party. This Guaranty is not made in reliance on any representation or warranty, express or implied, by the Administrative
Agent or any Lender concerning the financial condition of Borrower, the nature, value or extent of any security for the Guarantied Obligations, or any other matter. Guarantor warrants that it has full knowledge of the financial condition of Borrower
and agrees that it will continue to be fully cognizant of Borrower’s financial condition until all Guarantied Obligations are finally paid in full in cash, and neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender has any obligation to advise
Guarantor of any information relating to Borrower’s financial condition or otherwise relating to Borrower or any of the Guarantied Obligations or any security therefor or guaranty thereof.
(h) Guarantor will receive substantial direct and indirect benefits from the financial accommodations extended by the Administrative Agent or

(i) A true, complete and correct copy of the limited liability company agreement creating Guarantor and any amendments thereto, the
certificate of formation and all other documents creating and governing Guarantor (collectively, the “
Guarantor Formation Documents
”) have been furnished to Administrative Agent. The Guarantor Formation Documents constitute the
entire agreement among the members of Guarantor and are binding upon and enforceable against each of the members in accordance with their terms. There are no other agreements, oral or written, among any of the members with respect to Guarantor. No
breach exists under any of the Guarantor Formation Documents and no condition exists which, with the giving of notice or the passage of time would constitute a breach under any of the Guarantor Formation Documents.
(j) The balance sheet of Guarantor (and, if applicable, Guarantor’s respective Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis) as of each
Statement Date, and the related statements of income, and cash flows for the fiscal period ended on each Statement Date, furnished to the Administrative Agent, fairly present the financial condition of Guarantor (and, if applicable,
Guarantor’s Subsidiaries) as at that Statement Date and the results of its operations for the fiscal period ended on that Statement Date. Guarantor had, on each Statement Date, no known material
110
liabilities, direct or indirect, fixed or contingent, matured or unmatured, or liabilities for taxes, long-term leases or unusual forward or long-term commitments not disclosed by, or reserved
against in, those financial statements, and, at the present time, there are no material unrealized or anticipated losses from any loans, advances or other commitments of Guarantor except as previously disclosed to the Administrative Agent in
writing. Those financial statements were prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved. Since the Closing Date, there has been no material adverse change in the business, operations, assets or
financial condition of Guarantor (and, if applicable, Guarantor’s Subsidiaries), nor is Guarantor aware of any state of facts that (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) is reasonably likely to result in any such material adverse
change. All schedules and reports furnished by Guarantor to the Administrative Agent, including, without limitation, schedules of contingent liabilities and off balance sheet transactions, were materially true, accurate and complete, and did not
omit any information necessary in order to make any provided information not misleading in any material respect.
(k) To the best of
Guarantor’s knowledge, neither this Agreement, any other Transaction Document to which Guarantor is a party, nor any documents, financial statements, reports, notices, schedules, certificates, statements or other writings (other than any such
materials which were subsequently updated or corrected) furnished by or on behalf of Guarantor to the Administrative Agent in connection with the negotiation of this Agreement or other Transaction Documents or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, or required herein or by the other Transaction Documents to be furnished by or on behalf of Guarantor, with respect to the Guarantor, contains any untrue or misleading statement of a material fact or omits a material fact
necessary to make the statements herein or therein not misleading; there is no fact which Guarantor has not disclosed to the Administrative Agent in writing which materially and adversely affects Guarantor, or the ability of Guarantor to perform its
obligations under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party.
(l) As of the date of this Agreement,
Guarantor’s obligations under this Guaranty are not subject to any offsets or defenses against Administrative Agent or Lender of any kind.

Guarantor after any such setoff and application made by the Administrative Agent; provided however, that, the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff and application. The right of the Administrative Agent or any
Lender under this
Section
12.16
is in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff under Applicable Law or otherwise) which the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have.
