“
Demand Notes
”) issued by INVO Fertility, Inc. (f/k/a INVO Bioscience, Inc.; “

In
a letter dated August 13, 2025 (the “

extension of the maturity date of the Demand Notes to December 31, 2025, should INVO have paid $100,000 to JAG before September 30, 2025.
To date, INVO has not made such payment.
By
signing below, INVO and JAG agree to the following:
1.
Should
 INVO pay $100,000 to JAG before November 31, 2025, the maturity date of the Demand Notes will be extended automatically to December
 31, 2025;
2.
The
 exercise price on the warrant issued by INVO to JAG and dated August 13, 2025 will be reduced from $2 per share to $0.75 per share;
 and
3.
The
 remaining terms of the August Letter will remain unchanged.
