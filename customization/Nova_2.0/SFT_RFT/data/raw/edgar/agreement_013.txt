(a)
From and after November 13, 2025 (the “
Initial Issuance Date
”), each holder of a Preferred Share (each, a “
Holder
”
and collectively, the “
Holders
”) shall be entitled to receive dividends (“
Dividends
”), which Dividends
shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and twelve 30-day months and shall increase the Stated Value of the Preferred Shares
on each Dividend Date (as defined below). Dividends shall be payable in arrears on the first Trading Day of each Fiscal Quarter (each,
a “
Dividend Date
”) with the first Dividend Date being the first Trading Day of the initial full Fiscal Quarter commencing
after the Initial Issuance Date.

Dividend Rate
”) and be payable by way of inclusion of the Dividends in the Conversion Amount (as defined
below) on each Conversion Date (as defined below) in accordance with Section 4(c)(i) or upon any required payment upon any Bankruptcy

4.
Conversion
. At any time after the Initial Issuance Date, each Preferred Share shall be convertible into validly issued, fully
paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock (as defined below), on the terms and conditions set forth in this Section 4.
(a)
Holder’s Conversion Right
. Subject to the provisions of Section 4(d), at any time or times on or after the Initial Issuance
Date, each Holder shall be entitled to convert any portion of the outstanding Preferred Shares held by such Holder into validly issued,
fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock in accordance with Section 4(c) at the Conversion Rate (as defined below). The Company
shall not issue any fraction of a share of Common Stock upon any conversion. If the issuance would result in the issuance of a fraction
of a share of Common Stock, the Company shall round such fraction of a share of Common Stock up to the nearest whole share. The Company
shall pay any and all transfer, stamp, issuance and similar taxes, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, fees and expenses
of the Transfer Agent (as defined below)) that may be payable with respect to the issuance and delivery of Common Stock upon conversion
of any Preferred Shares.
(b)
Conversion Rate
. The number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of any Preferred Share pursuant to Section 4(a)
shall be determined by dividing (x) the Conversion Amount of such Preferred Share by (y) the Conversion Price (as defined below) (the
“
Conversion Rate
”):
(i)
“
Conversion Amount
” means, with respect to each Preferred Share, as of the applicable date of determination, the sum
of (1) the Stated Value thereof plus (2) the Additional Amount thereon and any accrued and unpaid Late Charges (as defined below in Section
27(c)) with respect to such Stated Value and Additional Amount as of such date of determination, plus (3) any other amounts owed to such
Holder pursuant to this Certificate of Designations or any Transaction Document.
(ii)
“
Conversion Price
” means, with respect to each Preferred Share, as of any Conversion Date or other date of determination,
$2.50 subject to adjustment as provided herein.
(c)
Mechanics of Conversion
. The conversion of each Preferred Share shall be conducted in the following manner:
(i)
Optional Conversion
. To convert a Preferred Share into shares of Common Stock on any date (a “
Conversion Date
”),
a Holder shall deliver (whether via electronic mail or otherwise), for receipt on or prior to 11:59 p.m., New York time, on such date,
a copy of an executed notice of conversion of the share(s) of Preferred Shares subject to such conversion in the form attached hereto
as
Exhibit I
(the “
Conversion Notice
”) to the Company. If required by Section 4(c)(iii), within one
(1) Trading Day following a conversion of any such Preferred Shares as aforesaid, such Holder shall surrender to a nationally recognized
overnight delivery service for delivery to the Company the original certificates, if any, representing the Preferred Shares (the “
Preferred
Share Certificates
”) so converted as aforesaid (or an indemnification undertaking with respect to the Preferred Shares in the
case of its loss, theft or destruction as contemplated by Section 21(b)). On the date of receipt of a Conversion Notice, the Company
shall transmit by electronic mail an acknowledgment of confirmation and representation as to whether such shares of Common Stock may
then be resold pursuant to Rule 144 or an effective and available Registration Statement (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement),
in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit II
, of receipt of such Conversion Notice to such Holder and the Company’s
transfer agent (the “
Transfer Agent
”), which confirmation shall constitute an instruction to the Transfer Agent to
process such Conversion Notice in accordance with the terms herein. On or before the first (1st) Trading Day following each date on which
the Company has received a Conversion Notice (or such earlier date as required pursuant to the 1934 Act or other applicable law, rule
or regulation for the settlement of a trade initiated on the applicable Conversion Date of such shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant
to such Conversion Notice) (the “
Share Delivery Deadline
”), the Company shall (1) provided such shares of Common Stock
issuable pursuant to such Conversion Notice are eligible for resale by such Holder pursuant to Rule 144 or pursuant to an effective Registration
Statement (the “
Unrestricted Resale Conditions
”) and the Transfer Agent is participating in The Depository Trust Company’s
(“
DTC
”) Fast Automated Securities Transfer Program (“
FAST
”), credit such aggregate number of shares
of Common Stock to which such Holder shall be entitled pursuant to such conversion to such Holder’s or its designee’s balance
account with DTC through its Deposit/Withdrawal at Custodian system, or (2) if the Transfer Agent is not participating in FAST or the
Unrestricted Resale Conditions are not satisfied, upon the request of such Holder, issue and deliver (via reputable overnight courier)
to the address as specified in such Conversion Notice, a certificate, registered in the name of such Holder or its designee, for the
number of shares of Common Stock to which such Holder shall be entitled. If the number of Preferred Shares represented by the Preferred
Share Certificate(s) submitted for conversion pursuant to Section 4(c)(iii) is greater than the number of Preferred Shares being converted,
then the Company shall, as soon as practicable and in no event later than two (2) Trading Days after receipt of the Preferred Share Certificate(s)
and at its own expense, issue and deliver to such Holder (or its designee) a new Preferred Share Certificate or a new Book-Entry (in
either case, in accordance with Section 21(d)) representing the number of Preferred Shares not converted. The Person or Persons entitled
to receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon a conversion of Preferred Shares shall be treated for all purposes as the record
holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on the Conversion Date; provided, that such Holder shall be deemed to have waived any
voting rights of any such shares of Common Stock during the period commencing on such Conversion Date, through, and including, such applicable
Share Delivery Deadline (each, an “
Conversion Period
”), as necessary, such that the aggregate voting rights of any
shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by such Holder and/or any Attribution Parties (as defined below), collectively, on any such
date of determination shall not exceed the Maximum Percentage (as defined below) as a result of any such conversion of the Preferred
Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Certificate of Designations or the Registration Rights Agreement,
after the effective date of a Registration Statement and prior to a Holder’s receipt of the notice of a Grace Period (as defined
in the Registration Rights Agreement), the Company shall cause the Transfer Agent to deliver unlegended shares of Common Stock to such
Holder (or its designee) in connection with any sale of Registrable Securities (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) with
respect to which such Holder has entered into a contract for sale, and delivered a copy of the prospectus included as part of the particular
Registration Statement to the extent applicable, and for which such Holder has not yet settled.
(ii)
Company’s Failure to Timely Convert
. If the Company shall fail, for any reason or for no reason, on or prior to the applicable
Share Delivery Deadline, either (I) if the Transfer Agent is not participating in FAST or the Unrestricted Resale Conditions are not
satisfied, to issue and deliver to such Holder (or its designee) a certificate for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such
Holder is entitled and register such shares of Common Stock on the Company’s share register or, if the Transfer Agent is participating
in FAST and the Unrestricted Resale Conditions are satisfied, to credit such Holder’s or its designee’s balance account with
DTC for such number of shares of Common Stock to which such Holder is entitled upon such Holder’s conversion of any Conversion
Amount (as the case may be) or (II) if the Registration Statement covering the resale of the shares of Common Stock that are the subject
of the Conversion Notice (the “
Unavailable Conversion Shares
”) is not available for the resale of such Unavailable
Conversion Shares and the Company fails to promptly, but in no event later than as required pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement
(x) notify such Holder and (y) deliver the shares of Common Stock electronically without any restrictive legend by crediting such aggregate
number of shares of Common Stock to which such Holder is entitled pursuant to such conversion to such Holder’s or its designee’s
balance account with DTC through its Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian system (the event described in the immediately foregoing clause
(II) is hereinafter referred as a “
Notice Failure
” and together with the event described in clause (I) above, a “
Conversion
Failure
”), then, in addition to all other remedies available to such Holder, (X) the Company shall pay in cash to such Holder
on each day after the Share Delivery Deadline that the issuance of such shares of Common Stock is not timely effected an amount equal
to 2% of the product of (A) the sum of the number of shares of Common Stock not issued to such Holder on or prior to the Share Delivery
Deadline and to which such Holder is entitled, multiplied by (B) any trading price of the Common Stock selected by such Holder in writing
as in effect at any time during the period beginning on the applicable Conversion Date and ending on the applicable Share Delivery Deadline,
and (Y) such Holder, upon written notice to the Company, may void its Conversion Notice with respect to, and retain or have returned,
as the case may be, all, or any portion, of such Preferred Shares that has not been converted pursuant to such Conversion Notice; provided
that the voiding of an Conversion Notice shall not affect the Company’s obligations to make any payments which have accrued prior
to the date of such notice pursuant to this Section 4(c)(ii) or otherwise. In addition to the foregoing, if on or prior to the Share
Delivery Deadline either (A) the Transfer Agent is not participating in FAST or the Unrestricted Resale Conditions are not satisfied,
the Company shall fail to issue and deliver to such Holder (or its designee) a certificate and register such shares of Common Stock on
the Company’s share register or, if the Transfer Agent is participating in FAST and the Unrestricted Resale Conditions are satisfied,
the Transfer Agent shall fail to credit the balance account of such Holder or such Holder’s designee, as applicable, with DTC for
the number of shares of Common Stock to which such Holder is entitled upon such Holder’s conversion hereunder or pursuant to the
Company’s obligation pursuant to clause (ii) below or (B) a Notice Failure occurs, and if on or after such Share Delivery Deadline
such Holder acquires (in an open market transaction, stock loan or otherwise) shares of Common Stock corresponding to all or any portion
of the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion that such Holder is entitled to receive from the Company and has
not received from the Company in connection with such Conversion Failure or Notice Failure, as applicable (a “
Buy-In
”),
then, in addition to all other remedies available to such Holder, the Company shall, within two (2) Business Days after receipt of such
Holder’s request and in such Holder’s discretion, either: (I) pay cash to such Holder in an amount equal to such Holder’s
total purchase price (including brokerage commissions, stock loan costs and other out-of-pocket expenses, if any) for the shares of Common
Stock so acquired (including, without limitation, by any other Person in respect, or on behalf, of such Holder) (the “
Buy-In
Price
”), at which point the Company’s obligation to so issue and deliver such certificate (and to issue such shares of
Common Stock) or credit to the balance account of such Holder or such Holder’s designee, as applicable, with DTC for the number
of shares of Common Stock to which such Holder is entitled upon such Holder’s conversion hereunder (as the case may be) (and to
issue such shares of Common Stock) shall terminate, or (II) promptly honor its obligation to so issue and deliver to such Holder a certificate
or certificates representing such shares of Common Stock or credit the balance account of such Holder or such Holder’s designee,
as applicable, with DTC for the number of shares of Common Stock to which such Holder is entitled upon such Holder’s conversion
hereunder (as the case may be) and pay cash to such Holder in an amount equal to the excess (if any) of the Buy-In Price over the product
of (x) such number of shares of Common Stock multiplied by (y) the lowest Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock on any Trading Day during
the period commencing on the date of the applicable Conversion Notice and ending on the date of such issuance and payment under this
clause (II) (the “
Buy-In Payment Amount
”). Nothing herein shall limit a Holder’s right to pursue any other remedies
available to it hereunder, at law or in equity, including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief
with respect to the Company’s failure to timely deliver certificates representing shares of Common Stock (or to electronically
deliver such shares of Common Stock) upon the conversion of the Preferred Shares as required pursuant to the terms hereof.
(iii)
Registration; Book-Entry
. At the time of issuance of any Preferred Shares hereunder, the applicable Holder may, by written request
(including by electronic-mail) to the Company, elect to receive such Preferred Shares in the form of one or more Preferred Share Certificates
or in Book-Entry form. The Company (or the Transfer Agent, as custodian for the Preferred Shares) shall maintain a register (the “
Register
”)
for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Holders of each Preferred Share and the Stated Value of the Preferred Shares and
whether the Preferred Shares are held by such Holder in Preferred Share Certificates or in Book-Entry form (the “
Registered
Preferred Shares
”). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes absent manifest error. The
Company and each Holder of the Preferred Shares shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register as the owner of a Preferred
Share for all purposes (including, without limitation, the right to receive payments and Dividends hereunder) notwithstanding notice
to the contrary. A Registered Preferred Share may be assigned, transferred or sold only by registration of such assignment or sale on
the Register. Upon its receipt of a written request to assign, transfer or sell one or more Registered Preferred Shares by such Holder
thereof, the Company shall record the information contained therein in the Register and issue one or more new Registered Preferred Shares
in the same aggregate Stated Value as the Stated Value of the surrendered Registered Preferred Shares to the designated assignee or transferee
pursuant to Section 21, provided that if the Company does not so record an assignment, transfer or sale (as the case may be) of such
Registered Preferred Shares within two (2) Business Days of such a request, then the Register shall be automatically deemed updated to
reflect such assignment, transfer or sale (as the case may be). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Section 4,
following conversion of any Preferred Shares in accordance with the terms hereof, the applicable Holder shall not be required to physically
surrender such Preferred Shares held in the form of a Preferred Share Certificate to the Company unless (A) the full or remaining number
of Preferred Shares represented by the applicable Preferred Share Certificate are being converted (in which event such certificate(s)
shall be delivered to the Company as contemplated by this Section 4(c)(iii)) or (B) such Holder has provided the Company with prior written
notice (which notice may be included in a Conversion Notice) requesting reissuance of Preferred Shares upon physical surrender of the
applicable Preferred Share Certificate. Each Holder and the Company shall maintain records showing the Stated Value, Dividends and Late
Charges converted and/or paid (as the case may be) and the dates of such conversions and/or payments (as the case may be) or shall use
such other method, reasonably satisfactory to such Holder and the Company, so as not to require physical surrender of a Preferred Share
Certificate upon conversion. If the Company does not update the Register to record such Stated Value, Dividends and Late Charges converted
and/or paid (as the case may be) and the dates of such conversions and/or payments (as the case may be) within two (2) Business Days
of such occurrence, then the Register shall be automatically deemed updated to reflect such occurrence. In the event of any dispute or
discrepancy, such records of such Holder establishing the number of Preferred Shares to which the record holder is entitled shall be
controlling and determinative in the absence of manifest error. A Holder and any transferee or assignee, by acceptance of a certificate,
acknowledge and agree that, by reason of the provisions of this paragraph, following conversion of any Preferred Shares, the number of
Preferred Shares represented by such certificate may be less than the number of Preferred Shares stated on the face thereof. Each Preferred
Share Certificate shall bear the following legend:
ANY
TRANSFEREE OR ASSIGNEE OF THIS CERTIFICATE SHOULD CAREFULLY REVIEW THE TERMS OF THE CORPORATION’S CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATIONS RELATING
TO THE SHARES OF SERIES B CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE, INCLUDING SECTION 4(c)(iii) THEREOF. THE NUMBER
OF SHARES OF SERIES B CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE MAY BE LESS THAN THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF SERIES B CONVERTIBLE
PREFERRED STOCK STATED ON THE FACE HEREOF PURSUANT TO SECTION 4(c)(iii) OF THE CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATIONS RELATING TO THE SHARES OF
SERIES B CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE.
(iv)
Pro Rata Conversion; Disputes
. In the event that the Company receives a Conversion Notice from more than one Holder for the
same Conversion Date and the Company can convert some, but not all, of such Preferred Shares submitted for conversion, the Company shall
convert from each Holder electing to have Preferred Shares converted on such date a pro rata amount of such Holder’s Preferred
Shares submitted for conversion on such date based on the number of Preferred Shares submitted for conversion on such date by such Holder
relative to the aggregate number of Preferred Shares submitted for conversion on such date. In the event of a dispute as to the number
of shares of Common Stock issuable to a Holder in connection with a conversion of Preferred Shares, the Company shall issue to such Holder
the number of shares of Common Stock not in dispute and resolve such dispute in accordance with Section 26.
(d)
Limitation on Beneficial Ownership
.
(i)
Beneficial Ownership
. The Company shall not effect the conversion of any of the Preferred Shares held by a Holder, and such Holder shall not have the right to convert any of the Preferred Shares held by such Holder pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Certificate of Designations and any such conversion shall be null and void and treated as if never made, to the extent that after giving effect to such conversion, such Holder together with the other Attribution Parties collectively would beneficially own in excess of 4.99% (the “
Maximum Percentage
”) of the shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such conversion. For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by such Holder and the other Attribution Parties shall include the number of shares of Common Stock held by such Holder and all other Attribution Parties plus the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Preferred Shares with respect to which the determination of such sentence is being made, but shall exclude shares of Common Stock which would be issuable upon (A) conversion of the remaining, nonconverted Preferred Shares beneficially owned by such Holder or any of the other Attribution Parties and (B) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or nonconverted portion of any other securities of the Company (including, without limitation, any convertible notes, convertible preferred stock or warrants, including the Preferred Shares) beneficially owned by such Holder or any other Attribution Party subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained in this Section 4(d)(i). For purposes of this Section 4(d)(i), beneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the 1934 Act. For purposes of determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock a Holder may acquire upon the conversion of such Preferred Shares without exceeding the Maximum Percentage, such Holder may rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock as reflected in (x) the Company’s most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, Current Report on Form 8-K or other public filing with the SEC, as the case may be, (y) a more recent public announcement by the Company or (z) any other written notice by the Company or the Transfer Agent, if any, setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding (the “
Reported Outstanding Share Number
”). If the Company receives a Conversion Notice from a Holder at a time when the actual number of outstanding shares of Common Stock is less than the Reported Outstanding Share Number, the Company shall notify such Holder in writing of the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding and, to the extent that such Conversion Notice would otherwise cause such Holder’s beneficial ownership, as determined pursuant to this Section 4(d)(i), to exceed the Maximum Percentage, such Holder must notify the Company of a reduced number of shares of Common Stock to be purchased pursuant to such Conversion Notice. For any reason at any time, upon the written or oral request of any Holder, the Company shall within one (1) Business Day confirm orally and in writing or by electronic mail to such Holder the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding. In any case, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Company, including such Preferred Shares, by such Holder and any other Attribution Party since the date as of which the Reported Outstanding Share Number was reported. In the event that the issuance of shares of Common Stock to a Holder upon conversion of such Preferred Shares results in such Holder and the other Attribution Parties being deemed to beneficially own, in the aggregate, more than the Maximum Percentage of the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock (as determined under Section 13(d) of the 1934 Act), the number of shares so issued by which such Holder’s and the other Attribution Parties’ aggregate beneficial ownership exceeds the Maximum Percentage (the “
Excess Shares
”) shall be deemed null and void and shall be cancelled ab initio, and such Holder shall not have the power to vote or to transfer the Excess Shares. Upon delivery of a written notice to the Company, any Holder may from time to time increase (with such increase not effective until the sixty-first (61st) day after delivery of such notice) or decrease the Maximum Percentage of such Holder to any other percentage not in excess of 9.99% as specified in such notice; provided that (i) any such increase in the Maximum Percentage will not be effective until the sixty-first (61st) day after such notice is delivered to the Company and (ii) any such increase or decrease will apply only to such Holder and the other Attribution Parties and not to any other Holder that is not an Attribution Party of such Holder. For purposes of clarity, the shares of Common Stock issuable to a Holder pursuant to the terms of this Certificate of Designations in excess of the Maximum Percentage shall not be deemed to be beneficially owned by such Holder for any purpose including for purposes of Section 13(d) or Rule 16a-1(a)(1) of the 1934 Act. No prior inability to convert such Preferred Shares pursuant to this paragraph shall have any effect on the applicability of the provisions of this paragraph with respect to any subsequent determination of convertibility. The provisions of this paragraph shall be construed and implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict conformity with the terms of this Section 4(d)(i) to the extent necessary to correct this paragraph (or any portion of this paragraph) which may be defective or inconsistent with the intended beneficial ownership limitation contained in this Section 4(d)(i) or to make changes or supplements necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such limitation. The limitation contained in this paragraph may not be amended, modified or waived and shall apply to a successor holder of such Preferred Shares.
(ii)
Principal Market Regulation
. The Company shall not issue any shares of Common Stock upon conversion of any Preferred Shares or
otherwise pursuant to the terms of this Certificate of Designations if the issuance of such shares of Common Stock would exceed the aggregate
number of shares of Common Stock which the Company may issue upon conversion of the Preferred Shares without breaching the Company’s
obligations under the rules and regulations the listing rules of the Principal Market (the maximum number of shares of Common Stock which
may be issued without violating such rules and regulations, including rules related to the aggregate of offerings under NASDAQ Listing
Rule 5635(d), the “
Exchange Cap
”), except that such limitation shall not apply in the event that the Company (A) obtains
the approval of its stockholders as required by the applicable rules and regulations of the Principal Market for issuances of shares
of Common Stock in excess of such amount or (B) obtains a written opinion from outside counsel to the Company that such approval is not
required, which opinion shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Holder . Until such approval or such written opinion is obtained, no
Holder shall be issued in the aggregate, upon conversion of any Preferred Shares, shares of Common Stock in an amount greater than the
product of (i) the Exchange Cap as of the Initial Issuance Date multiplied by (ii) the quotient of (1) the aggregate number of Preferred
Shares issued to such Holder on the Initial Issuance Date divided by (2) the aggregate number of Preferred Shares issued to the Holders
on the Initial Issuance Date (with respect to each Holder, the “
Exchange Cap Allocation
”). In the event that any Holder
shall sell or otherwise transfer any of such Holder’s Preferred Shares, the transferee shall be allocated a pro rata portion of
such Holder’s Exchange Cap Allocation with respect to such portion of such Preferred Shares so transferred, and the restrictions
of the prior sentence shall apply to such transferee with respect to the portion of the Exchange Cap Allocation so allocated to such
transferee. Upon conversion in full of a holder’s Preferred Shares, the difference (if any) between such holder’s Exchange
Cap Allocation and the number of shares of Common Stock actually issued to such holder upon such holder’s conversion in full of
such Preferred Shares shall be allocated, to the respective Exchange Cap Allocations of the remaining holders of Preferred Shares on
a pro rata basis in proportion to the shares of Common Stock underlying the Preferred Shares then held by each such holder of Preferred
Shares. In the event that the Company is prohibited from issuing any shares of Common Stock pursuant to this Section 4(d)(ii)(the “
Exchange
Cap Shares
”) to a Holder, the Company shall pay cash to such Holder in exchange for the redemption of such number of Preferred
Shares held by such Holder that are not convertible into such Exchange Cap Shares at a price equal to the sum of (i) the product of (x)
such number of Exchange Cap Shares and (y) the greatest Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock on any Trading Day during the period commencing
on the date such Holder delivers the applicable Conversion Notice with respect to such Exchange Cap Shares to the Company and ending
on the date of such issuance and payment under this Section 4(d)(ii) and (ii) to the extent of any Buy-In related thereto, any Buy-In
Payment Amount, any brokerage commissions and other out-of-pocket expenses, if any, of such Holder incurred in connection therewith (collectively,
the “
Exchange Cap Share Cancellation Amount
”).
(e)
Alternate Conversion upon a Triggering Event
.
(i)
General
. Subject to Section 4(d), at any time after the occurrence of a Triggering Event (regardless of whether such Triggering
Event has been cured, or if the Company has delivered an Triggering Event Notice (as defined below) to such applicable Holder or if such
Holder has delivered an Triggering Event Redemption Notice (as defined below) to the Company or otherwise notified the Company that an
Triggering Event has occurred), such Holder may, at such Holder’s option, by delivery of a Conversion Notice to the Company (the
date of any such Conversion Notice, each an “
Alternate Conversion Date
”), convert all, or any number of Preferred
Shares (such Conversion Amount of the Preferred Shares to be converted pursuant to this Section 4(e), the “
Alternate Conversion
Amount
”) into shares of Common Stock at the Alternate Conversion Price (each, a “
Alternate Conversion
”).
(ii)
Mechanics of Alternate Conversion
. On any Alternate Conversion Date, a Holder may voluntarily convert any Alternate Conversion
Amount pursuant to Section 4(c) (with “Alternate Conversion Price” replacing “Conversion Price” for all purposes
hereunder with respect to such Alternate Conversion in clause (x) of the definition of Conversion Rate above with respect to such Alternate
Conversion) by designating in the Conversion Notice delivered pursuant to this Section 4(e) of this Certificate of Designations that
such Holder is electing to use the Alternate Conversion Price for such conversion; Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
4(e), but subject to Section 4(d), until the Company delivers shares of Common Stock representing the applicable Alternate Conversion
Amount to such Holder, such Alternate Conversion Amount may be converted by such Holder into shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section
4(c) without regard to this Section 4(e). In the event of an Alternate Conversion pursuant to this Section 4(e) of all, or any number
of the Preferred Shares of a Holder, such Holder’s damages would be uncertain and difficult to estimate because of the parties’
inability to predict future interest rates and the uncertainty of the availability of a suitable substitute investment opportunity for
such Holder. The Alternate Conversion Price used in such Alternate Conversion, as applicable, is intended by the parties to be, and shall
be deemed, a reasonable estimate of, such Holder’s actual loss of its investment opportunity and not as a penalty.

6.
Rights Upon Fundamental Transactions
.
(a)
Assumption
. The Company shall not enter into or be party to a Fundamental Transaction unless (i) the Successor Entity assumes
in writing all of the obligations of the Company under this Certificate of Designations and the other Transaction Documents in accordance
with the provisions of this Section 6(a) pursuant to written agreements in form and substance satisfactory to the Holder and approved
by the Holder prior to such Fundamental Transaction, including agreements to deliver to each holder of Preferred Shares in exchange for
such Preferred Shares a security of the Successor Entity evidenced by a written instrument substantially similar in form and substance
to this Certificate of Designations, including, without limitation, having a stated value and dividend rate equal to the stated value
and dividend rate of the Preferred Shares held by the Holders and having similar ranking to the Preferred Shares, and satisfactory to
the Holder and (ii) the Successor Entity (including its Parent Entity) is a publicly traded corporation whose shares of common stock
are quoted on or listed for trading on an Eligible Market. Upon the occurrence of any Fundamental Transaction, the Successor Entity shall
succeed to, and be substituted for (so that from and after the date of such Fundamental Transaction, the provisions of this Certificate
of Designations and the other Transaction Documents referring to the “Company” shall refer instead to the Successor Entity),
and may exercise every right and power of the Company and shall assume all of the obligations of the Company under this Certificate of
Designations and the other Transaction Documents with the same effect as if such Successor Entity had been named as the Company herein
and therein. In addition to the foregoing, upon consummation of a Fundamental Transaction, the Successor Entity shall deliver to each
Holder confirmation that there shall be issued upon conversion of the Preferred Shares at any time after the consummation of such Fundamental
Transaction, in lieu of the shares of Common Stock (or other securities, cash, assets or other property (except such items still issuable
under Sections 7 and 18, which shall continue to be receivable thereafter)) issuable upon the conversion n of the Preferred Shares prior
to such Fundamental Transaction, such shares of the publicly traded common stock (or their equivalent) of the Successor Entity (including
its Parent Entity) which each Holder would have been entitled to receive upon the happening of such Fundamental Transaction had all the
Preferred Shares held by each Holder been converted immediately prior to such Fundamental Transaction (without regard to any limitations
on the conversion of the Preferred Shares contained in this Certificate of Designations), as adjusted in accordance with the provisions
of this Certificate of Designations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such Holder may elect, at its sole option, by delivery of written
notice to the Company to waive this Section 6(a) to permit the Fundamental Transaction without the assumption of the Preferred Shares.
The provisions of this Section 6 shall apply similarly and equally to successive Fundamental Transactions and shall be applied without
regard to any limitations on the conversion of the Preferred Shares.
(b)
Notice of a Change of Control
. No sooner than twenty (20) Trading Days nor later than ten (10) Trading Days prior to the consummation
of a Change of Control (the “
Change of Control Date
”), but not prior to the public announcement of such Change of
Control, the Company shall deliver written notice thereof via electronic mail and overnight courier to each Holder (a “
Change
of Control Notice
”).
7.
Rights Upon Issuance of Purchase Rights and Other Corporate Events
.
(a)
Purchase Rights
. In addition to any adjustments pursuant to Section 8 and Section 18 below, if at any time the Company grants,
issues or sells any Options (specifically excluding Options pursuant to an Approved Stock Plan to the parties eligible to receive Options
thereunder), Convertible Securities or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other property pro rata to all or substantially
all of the record holders of any class of Common Stock (the “
Purchase Rights
”), then each Holder will be entitled
to acquire, upon the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which such Holder could have acquired if
such Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of all the Preferred Shares (without taking
into account any limitations or restrictions on the convertibility of the Preferred Shares and assuming for such purpose that all the
Preferred Shares were converted at the Alternate Conversion Price as of the applicable record date) held by such Holder immediately prior
to the date on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, or, if no such record is taken, the date
as of which the record holders of shares of Common Stock are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such Purchase Rights (provided,
however, to the extent that such Holder’s right to participate in any such Purchase Right would result in such Holder and the other
Attribution Parties exceeding the Maximum Percentage, then such Holder shall not be entitled to participate in such Purchase Right to
such extent of the Maximum Percentage (and shall not be entitled to beneficial ownership of such shares of Common Stock as a result of
such Purchase Right (and beneficial ownership) to such extent of any such excess)) and such Purchase Right to such extent shall be held
in abeyance (and, if such Purchase Right has an expiration date, maturity date or other similar provision, such term shall be extended
by such number of days held in abeyance, if applicable) for the benefit of such Holder until such time or times, if ever, as its right
thereto would not result in such Holder and the other Attribution Parties exceeding the Maximum Percentage, at which time or times such
Holder shall be granted such right (and any Purchase Right granted, issued or sold on such initial Purchase Right or on any subsequent
Purchase Right held similarly in abeyance (and, if such Purchase Right has an expiration date, maturity date or other similar provision,
such term shall be extended by such number of days held in abeyance, if applicable)) to the same extent as if there had been no such
limitation.
(b)
Other Corporate Events
. In addition to and not in substitution for any other rights hereunder, prior to the consummation of any
Fundamental Transaction pursuant to which holders of shares of Common Stock are entitled to receive securities or other assets with respect
to or in exchange for shares of Common Stock (a “
Corporate Event
”), the Company shall make appropriate provision to
ensure that each Holder will thereafter have the right, at such Holder’s option, to receive upon a conversion of all the Preferred
Shares held by such Holder (i) in addition to the shares of Common Stock receivable upon such conversion, such securities or other assets
to which such Holder would have been entitled with respect to such shares of Common Stock had such shares of Common Stock been held by
such Holder upon the consummation of such Corporate Event (without taking into account any limitations or restrictions on the convertibility
of the Preferred Shares set forth in this Certificate of Designations) or (ii) in lieu of the shares of Common Stock otherwise receivable
upon such conversion, such securities or other assets received by the holders of shares of Common Stock in connection with the consummation
of such Corporate Event in such amounts as such Holder would have been entitled to receive had the Preferred Shares held by such Holder
initially been issued with conversion rights for the form of such consideration (as opposed to shares of Common Stock) at a conversion
rate for such consideration commensurate with the Conversion Rate. Provision made pursuant the preceding sentence shall be in a form
and substance satisfactory to the Holder. The provisions of this Section 7 shall apply similarly and equally to successive Corporate
Events and shall be applied without regard to any limitations on the conversion or redemption of the Preferred Shares set forth in this
Certificate of Designations.
8.
Rights Upon Issuance of Other Securities
.
(a)
Adjustment of Conversion Price upon Issuance of Common Stock
. If and whenever on or after the Subscription Date the Company grants,
issues or sells (or enters into any agreement to grant, issue or sell), or in accordance with this Section 8(a) is deemed to have granted,
issued or sold, any shares of Common Stock (including the granting, issuance or sale of shares of Common Stock owned or held by or for
the account of the Company, but excluding any Excluded Securities granted, issued or sold or deemed to have been granted, issued or sold)
for a consideration per share (the “
New Issuance Price
”) less than a price equal to the Conversion Price in effect
immediately prior to such granting, issuance or sale or deemed granting, issuance or sale (such Conversion Price then in effect is referred
to herein as the “
Applicable Price
”) (the foregoing a “
Dilutive Issuance
”), then, immediately after
such Dilutive Issuance, the Conversion Price then in effect shall be reduced to an amount equal to the New Issuance Price. For all purposes
of the foregoing (including, without limitation, determining the adjusted Conversion Price and the New Issuance Price under this Section
8(a)), the following shall be applicable:
(i)
Issuance of Options
. If the Company in any manner grants, issues or sells (or enters into any agreement to grant, issue or sell)
any Options (specifically excluding Options pursuant to an Approved Stock Plan to the parties eligible to receive Options thereunder),
and the lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is at any time issuable upon the exercise of any such Option or upon
conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of any such Option or otherwise pursuant to the
terms thereof is less than the Applicable Price, then such share of Common Stock shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued
and sold by the Company at the time of the granting, issuance or sale of such Option for such price per share. For purposes of this Section
8(a)(i), the “lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is at any time issuable upon the exercise of any such
Option or upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of any such Option or otherwise
pursuant to the terms thereof” shall be equal to (1) the lower of (x) the sum of the lowest amounts of consideration (if any) received
or receivable by the Company with respect to any one share of Common Stock upon the granting, issuance or sale of such Option, upon exercise
of such Option and upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Security issuable upon exercise of such Option or otherwise
pursuant to the terms thereof and (y) the lowest exercise price set forth in such Option for which one share of Common Stock is issuable
(or may become issuable assuming all possible market conditions) upon the exercise of any such Options or upon conversion, exercise or
exchange of any Convertible Securities issuable upon exercise of any such Option or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof, minus (2)
the sum of all amounts paid or payable to the holder of such Option (or any other Person) with respect to any one share of Common Stock
upon the granting, issuance or sale of such Option, upon exercise of such Option and upon conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible
Security issuable upon exercise of such Option or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof plus the value of any other consideration (including,
without limitation, consideration consisting of cash, debt forgiveness, assets or any other property) received or receivable by, or benefit
conferred on, the holder of such Option (or any other Person). Except as contemplated below, no further adjustment of the Conversion
Price shall be made upon the actual issuance of such share of Common Stock or of such Convertible Securities upon the exercise of such
Options or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof or upon the actual issuance of such shares of Common Stock upon conversion, exercise
or exchange of such Convertible Securities.
(ii)
Issuance of Convertible Securities
. If the Company in any manner issues or sells (or enters into any agreement to issue or sell)
any Convertible Securities and the lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is at any time issuable upon the conversion,
exercise or exchange thereof or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof is less than the Applicable Price, then such share of Common
Stock shall be deemed to be outstanding and to have been issued and sold by the Company at the time of the issuance or sale (or the time
of execution of such agreement to issue or sell, as applicable) of such Convertible Securities for such price per share. For the purposes
of this Section 8(a)(ii), the “lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is at any time issuable upon the conversion,
exercise or exchange thereof or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof” shall be equal to (1) the lower of (x) the sum of the
lowest amounts of consideration (if any) received or receivable by the Company with respect to one share of Common Stock upon the issuance
or sale (or pursuant to the agreement to issue or sell, as applicable) of the Convertible Security and upon conversion, exercise or exchange
of such Convertible Security or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof and (y) the lowest conversion price set forth in such Convertible
Security for which one share of Common Stock is issuable (or may become issuable assuming all possible market conditions) upon conversion,
exercise or exchange thereof or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof minus (2) the sum of all amounts paid or payable to the holder
of such Convertible Security (or any other Person) with respect to any one share of Common Stock upon the issuance or sale (or the agreement
to issue or sell, as applicable) of such Convertible Security plus the value of any other consideration received or receivable (including,
without limitation, any consideration consisting of cash, debt forgiveness, assets or other property) by, or benefit conferred on, the
holder of such Convertible Security (or any other Person). Except as contemplated below, no further adjustment of the Conversion Price
shall be made upon the actual issuance of such shares of Common Stock upon conversion, exercise or exchange of such Convertible Securities
or otherwise pursuant to the terms thereof, and if any such issuance or sale of such Convertible Securities is made upon exercise of
any Options for which adjustment of the Conversion Price has been or is to be made pursuant to other provisions of this Section 8(a),
except as contemplated below, no further adjustment of the Conversion Price shall be made by reason of such issuance or sale.
(iii)
Change in Option Price or Rate of Conversion
. If the purchase or exercise price provided for in any Options, the additional consideration,
if any, payable upon the issue, conversion, exercise or exchange of any Convertible Securities, or the rate at which any Convertible
Securities are convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock increases or decreases at any time (other than
proportional changes in conversion or exercise prices, as applicable, in connection with an event referred to in Section 8(b) below),
the Conversion Price in effect at the time of such increase or decrease shall be adjusted to the Conversion Price which would have been
in effect at such time had such Options or Convertible Securities provided for such increased or decreased purchase price, additional
consideration or increased or decreased conversion rate (as the case may be) at the time initially granted, issued or sold. For purposes
of this Section 8(a)(iii), if the terms of any Option or Convertible Security (including, without limitation, any Option or Convertible
Security that was outstanding as of the Subscription Date) are increased or decreased in the manner described in the immediately preceding
sentence, then such Option or Convertible Security and the shares of Common Stock deemed issuable upon exercise, conversion or exchange
thereof shall be deemed to have been issued as of the date of such increase or decrease. No adjustment pursuant to this Section 8(a)
shall be made if such adjustment would result in an increase of the Conversion Price then in effect.
(iv)
Calculation of Consideration Received
. If any Option and/or Convertible Security and/or Adjustment Right is issued in connection
with the issuance or sale or deemed issuance or sale of any other securities of the Company (as determined by the Holder, the “
Primary
Security
”, and such Option and/or Convertible Security and/or Adjustment Right, the “
Secondary Securities
”),
together comprising one integrated transaction (or one or more transactions if such issuances or sales or deemed issuances or sales of
securities of the Company either (A) have at least one investor or purchaser in common, (B) are consummated in reasonable proximity to
each other and/or (C) are consummated under the same plan of financing), the aggregate consideration per share of Common Stock with respect
to such Primary Security shall be deemed to be equal to the difference of (x) the lowest price per share for which one share of Common
Stock was issued (or was deemed to be issued pursuant to Section 8(a)(i) or 8(a)(ii) above, as applicable) in such integrated transaction
solely with respect to such Primary Security, minus (y) with respect to such Secondary Securities, the sum of (A) the Black Scholes Consideration
Value of each such Option, if any, (B) the fair market value (as mutually and timely determined in good faith by the Company and such
Holder) or the Black Scholes Consideration Value, as applicable, of such Adjustment Right, if any, and (C) the fair market value (as
mutually and timely determined in good faith by the Company and such Holder) of such Convertible Security, if any, in each case, as determined
on a per share basis in accordance with this Section 8(a)(iv). If the Company and such Holder are unable to timely agree upon any such
fair market value then such dispute shall be resolved in accordance with the procedures of Section 26. If any shares of Common Stock,
Options or Convertible Securities are issued or sold or deemed to have been issued or sold for cash, the consideration received therefor
(for the purpose of determining the consideration paid for such Common Stock, Option or Convertible Security, but not for the purpose
of the calculation of the Black Scholes Consideration Value) will be deemed to be the net amount of consideration received by the Company
therefor. If any shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities are issued or sold for a consideration other than cash, the
amount of such consideration received by the Company (for the purpose of determining the consideration paid for such Common Stock, Option
or Convertible Security, but not for the purpose of the calculation of the Black Scholes Consideration Value), will be the fair value
of such consideration, except where such consideration consists of publicly traded securities, in which case the amount of consideration
received by the Company for such securities will be the arithmetic average of the VWAPs of such security for each of the five (5) Trading
Days immediately preceding the date of receipt. If any shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities are issued to the owners
of the non-surviving entity in connection with any merger in which the Company is the surviving entity, the amount of consideration therefor
(for the purpose of determining the consideration paid for such Common Stock, Option or Convertible Security, but not for the purpose
of the calculation of the Black Scholes Consideration Value), will be deemed to be the fair value of such portion of the net assets and
business of the non-surviving entity as is attributable to such shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities (as the case
may be). The fair value of any consideration other than cash or publicly traded securities will be determined jointly by the Company
and the Holder. If the Company and such Holder are unable to timely agree upon any such fair market value then such dispute shall be
resolved in accordance with the procedures of Section 26.
(v)
Record Date
. If the Company takes a record of the holders of shares of Common Stock for the purpose of entitling them (A) to receive
a dividend or other distribution payable in shares of Common Stock, Options or in Convertible Securities or (B) to subscribe for or purchase
shares of Common Stock, Options or Convertible Securities, then such record date will be deemed to be the date of the issuance or sale
of the shares of Common Stock deemed to have been issued or sold upon the declaration of such dividend or the making of such other distribution
or the date of the granting of such right of subscription or purchase (as the case may be).
(b)
Adjustment of Conversion Price upon Subdivision or Combination of Common Stock
. Without limiting any provision of Section 6, Section
18 or Section 8(a), if the Company at any time on or after the Subscription Date subdivides (by any stock split, stock dividend, stock
combination, recapitalization or other similar transaction) one or more classes of its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a greater
number of shares, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such subdivision will be proportionately reduced. Without limiting
any provision of Section 6, Section 18 or Section 8(a), if the Company at any time on or after the Subscription Date combines (by any
stock split, stock dividend, stock combination, recapitalization or other similar transaction) one or more classes of its outstanding
shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior to such combination will be
proportionately increased. Any adjustment pursuant to this Section 8(b) shall become effective immediately after the effective date of
such subdivision or combination. If any event requiring an adjustment under this Section 8(b) occurs during the period that a Conversion
Price is calculated hereunder, then the calculation of such Conversion Price shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect such event.
(c)
Holder’s Right of Adjusted Conversion Price
. In addition to and not in limitation of the other provisions of this Section
8(c), if the Company in any manner issues or sells or enters into any agreement to issue or sell, any Common Stock, Options or Convertible
Securities (other than with respect to a Exempt Issuance (as defined in the Securities Purchase Agreement)) (any such securities, “
Variable
Price Securities
”) after the Subscription Date that are issuable pursuant to such agreement or convertible into or exchangeable
or exercisable for shares of Common Stock at a price which varies or may vary with the market price of the shares of Common Stock, including
by way of one or more reset(s) to a fixed price, but exclusive of such formulations reflecting customary anti-dilution provisions (such
as share splits, share combinations, share dividends and similar transactions) (each of the formulations for such variable price being
herein referred to as, the “
Variable Price
”), the Company shall provide written notice thereof via electronic mail
and overnight courier to each Holder on the date of such agreement and/or the issuance of such shares of Common Stock, Convertible Securities
or Options, as applicable. From and after the date the Company enters into such agreement or issues any such Variable Price Securities,
each Holder shall have the right, but not the obligation, in its sole discretion to substitute the Variable Price for the Conversion
Price upon conversion of the Preferred Shares by designating in the Conversion Notice delivered upon any conversion of Preferred Shares
that solely for purposes of such conversion such Holder is relying on the Variable Price rather than the Conversion Price then in effect.
A Holder’s election to rely on a Variable Price for a particular conversion of Preferred Shares shall not obligate such Holder
to rely on a Variable Price for any future conversions of Preferred Shares.
(d)
Stock Combination Event Adjustments
. If at any time and from time to time on or after the Subscription Date there occurs any stock
split, stock dividend, stock combination recapitalization or other similar transaction involving the Common Stock (each, a “
Stock
Combination Event
”, and such date thereof, the “
Stock Combination Event Date
”) and the Event Market Price
is less than the Conversion Price then in effect (after giving effect to the adjustment in Section 8(b) above), then on the sixteenth
(16th) Trading Day immediately following such Stock Combination Event Date (each, a “
Stock Combination Adjustment Date
”),
the Conversion Price then in effect on such sixteenth (16th) Trading Day (after giving effect to the adjustment in Section 8(b) above)
shall be reduced (but in no event increased) to the Event Market Price. For the avoidance of doubt, if the adjustment in the immediately
preceding sentence would otherwise result in an increase in the Conversion Price hereunder, no adjustment shall be made. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if a Holder requests to convert any Preferred Shares in whole or in part on any given date during a Stock Combination
Measuring Period, solely with respect to such Preferred Shares being converted on such applicable Conversion Date, (a) such applicable
Stock Combination Adjustment Date shall be deemed to mean such Conversion Date, (b) such applicable Stock Combination Measuring Period
shall be deemed to have ended on the Trading Day immediately prior to such Conversion Date and (c) the applicable Event Market Price
for such converted Preferred Shares shall be calculated pursuant to this Section 8(d). For the avoidance of doubt, following the calculation
of the Event Market Price pursuant to this Section 8(d), the Company’s obligations with regard to such converted Preferred Shares
shall be deemed satisfied and no additional Event Market Price shall apply to such converted Preferred Shares.
(e)
Other Events
. In the event that the Company (or any Subsidiary) shall take any action to which the provisions hereof are not strictly
applicable, or, if applicable, would not operate to protect any Holder from dilution or if any event occurs of the type contemplated
by the provisions of this Section 8 but not expressly provided for by such provisions (including, without limitation, the granting of
stock appreciation rights, phantom stock rights or other rights with equity features), then the Board shall in good faith determine and
implement an appropriate adjustment in the Conversion Price so as to protect the rights of such Holder, provided that no such adjustment
pursuant to this Section 8(b) will increase the Conversion Price as otherwise determined pursuant to this Section 8, provided further
that if such Holder does not accept such adjustments as appropriately protecting its interests hereunder against such dilution, then
the Board and such Holder shall agree, in good faith, upon an independent investment bank of nationally recognized standing to make such
appropriate adjustments, whose determination shall be final and binding absent manifest error and whose fees and expenses shall be borne
by the Company.
(f)
Calculations
. All calculations under this Section 8 shall be made by rounding to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100th of a
share, as applicable. The number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any given time shall not include shares owned or held by or
for the account of the Company, and the disposition of any such shares shall be considered an issue or sale of Common Stock.
(g)
Voluntary Adjustment by Company
. Subject to the rules and regulations of the Principal Market, the Company may at any time any
Preferred Shares remain outstanding, with the prior written consent of the Holder, reduce the then current Conversion Price to any amount
and for any period of time deemed appropriate by the Board.
(h)
Reserved.
(i)
Exchange Right
. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if a Holder participates in a Subsequent Placement, each such
Holder may, at the option of such Holder as elected in writing to the Company, satisfy the purchase price of the securities to be sold
to such Holder in such Subsequent Placement, in whole or in part, with Preferred Shares valued at 120% of the Conversion Amount of the
Preferred Shares delivered by such Holder as payment therefor.
(j)
Voluntary Adjustment by Holder
. Subject to the rules and regulations of the Principal Market, the Holder, may at any time any
Preferred Shares remain outstanding, use the Adjusted Conversion Price for a specific Conversion Date or other date of determination.
9.
Noncircumvention
. The Company hereby covenants and agrees that the Company will not, by amendment of its Certificate of Incorporation
(as defined in the Securities Purchase Agreement), Bylaws (as defined in the Securities Purchase Agreement) or through any reorganization,
transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, scheme of arrangement, dissolution, issue or sale of securities, or any other voluntary action,
avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of this Certificate of Designations, and will at all times in
good faith carry out all the provisions of this Certificate of Designations and take all action as may be required to protect the rights
of the Holders hereunder. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing or any other provision of this Certificate of Designations
or the other Transaction Documents, the Company (a) shall not increase the par value of any shares of Common Stock receivable upon the
conversion of any Preferred Shares above the Conversion Price then in effect, (b) shall take all such actions as may be necessary or
appropriate in order that the Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock upon the conversion
of Preferred Shares and (c) shall, so long as any Preferred Shares are outstanding, take all action necessary to reserve and keep available
out of its authorized and unissued shares of Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of the Preferred Shares,
the maximum number of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be necessary to effect the conversion of the Preferred Shares
then outstanding (without regard to any limitations on conversion contained herein). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
if after the sixty (60) calendar day anniversary of the Initial Issuance Date, each Holder is not permitted to convert such Holder’s
Preferred Shares in full for any reason (other than pursuant to restrictions set forth in Section 4(d)(i) hereof), the Company shall
use its best efforts to promptly remedy such failure, including, without limitation, obtaining such consents or approvals as necessary
to effect such conversion into shares of Common Stock.
10.
Authorized Shares
.
(a)
Reservation
. So long as any Preferred Shares remain outstanding, the Company shall at all times reserve at least 200% of the number
of shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be necessary to effect the conversion, including without limitation, Alternate Conversions,
of all of the Preferred Shares then outstanding at the Alternate Conversion Price then in effect (without regard to any limitations on
conversions and assuming the Preferred Shares remain outstanding until the Maturity Date) (the “
Required Reserve Amount
”).
The Required Reserve Amount (including, without limitation, each increase in the number of shares so reserved) shall be allocated pro
rata among the Holders based on the number of the Preferred Shares held by each Holder on the Initial Issuance Date or increase in the
number of reserved shares, as the case may be (the “
Authorized Share Allocation
”). In the event that a Holder shall
sell or otherwise transfer any of such Holder’s Preferred Shares, each transferee shall be allocated a pro rata portion of such
Holder’s Authorized Share Allocation. Any shares of Common Stock reserved and allocated to any Person which ceases to hold any
Preferred Shares shall be allocated to the remaining Holders of Preferred Shares, pro rata based on the number of the Preferred Shares
then held by the Holders.
(b)
Insufficient Authorized Shares
. If, notwithstanding Section 10(a) and not in limitation thereof, at any time while any of the
Preferred Shares remain outstanding the Company does not have a sufficient number of authorized and unreserved shares of Common Stock
to satisfy its obligation to reserve for issuance upon conversion of the Preferred Shares at least a number of shares of Common Stock
equal to the Required Reserve Amount (an “
Authorized Share Failure
”), then the Company shall immediately take all
action necessary to increase the Company’s authorized shares of Common Stock to an amount sufficient to allow the Company to reserve
the Required Reserve Amount for the Preferred Shares then outstanding (or deemed outstanding pursuant to Section 12(a) above). Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing sentence, as soon as practicable after the date of the occurrence of an Authorized Share Failure,
but in no event later than sixty (60) days after the occurrence of such Authorized Share Failure, the Company shall hold a meeting of
its stockholders for the approval of an increase in the number of authorized shares of Common Stock. In connection with such meeting,
the Company shall provide each stockholder with a proxy statement and shall use its best efforts to solicit its stockholders’ approval
of such increase in authorized shares of Common Stock and to cause its board of directors to recommend to the stockholders that they
approve such proposal (or, if a majority of the voting power then in effect of the capital stock of the Company consents to such increase,
in lieu of such proxy statement, deliver to the stockholders of the Company an information statement that has been filed with (and either
approved by or not subject to comments from) the SEC with respect thereto). In the event that the Company is prohibited from issuing
shares of Common Stock to a Holder upon any conversion due to the failure by the Company to have sufficient shares of Common Stock available
out of the authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock (such unavailable number of shares of Common Stock, the “
Authorized
Failure Shares
”), in lieu of delivering such Authorized Failure Shares to such Holder, the Company shall pay cash in exchange
for the redemption of such portion of the Conversion Amount of the Preferred Shares convertible into such Authorized Failure Shares at
a price equal to the sum of (i) the product of (x) such number of Authorized Failure Shares and (y) the greatest Closing Sale Price of
the Common Stock on any Trading Day during the period commencing on the date such Holder delivers the applicable Conversion Notice with
respect to such Authorized Failure Shares to the Company and ending on the date of such issuance and payment under this Section 12(a);
and (ii) to the extent such Holder purchases (in an open market transaction or otherwise) shares of Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction
of a sale by such Holder of Authorized Failure Shares, any brokerage commissions and other out-of-pocket expenses, if any, of such Holder
incurred in connection therewith. Nothing contained in Section 12(a) or this Section 12(b) shall limit any obligations of the Company
under any provision of the Securities Purchase Agreement.
11.
Voting Rights
. Holders of Preferred Shares shall have no voting rights, except as required by law (including without limitation,
the DGCL) and as expressly provided in this Certificate of Designations. To the extent that under the DGCL the vote of the holders of
the Preferred Shares, voting separately as a class or series, as applicable, is required to authorize a given action of the Company,
the affirmative vote or consent of the Holderof the shares of the Preferred Shares, voting together in the aggregate and not in separate
series unless required under the DGCL, represented at a duly held meeting at which a quorum is presented or by written consent of the
Holder (except as otherwise may be required under the DGCL), voting together in the aggregate and not in separate series unless required
under the DGCL, shall constitute the approval of such action by both the class or the series, as applicable. Subject to Section 4(d),
to the extent that under the DGCL holders of the Preferred Shares are entitled to vote on a matter with holders of shares of Common Stock,
voting together as one class, each Preferred Share shall entitle the holder thereof to cast that number of votes per share as is equal
to the number of shares of Common Stock into which it is then convertible (subject to the ownership limitations specified in Section
4(d) hereof) using the record date for determining the stockholders of the Company eligible to vote on such matters as the date as of
which the Conversion Price is calculated. Holders of the Preferred Shares shall be entitled to written notice of all stockholder meetings
or written consents (and copies of proxy materials and other information sent to stockholders) with respect to which they would be entitled
to vote, which notice would be provided pursuant to the Company’s bylaws and the DGCL.
12.
Liquidation, Dissolution, Winding-Up
. In the event of a Liquidation Event, the Holders shall be entitled to receive in cash out
of the assets of the Company, whether from capital or from earnings available for distribution to its stockholders (the “
Liquidation
Funds
”), before any amount shall be paid to the holders of any of shares of Junior Stock, but pari passu with any Parity Stock
then outstanding, an amount per Preferred Share equal to the greater of (A) 125% of the Conversion Amount of such Preferred Share on
the date of such payment and (B) the amount per share such Holder would receive if such Holder converted such Preferred Share into Common
Stock immediately prior to the date of such payment, provided that if the Liquidation Funds are insufficient to pay the full amount due
to the Holders and holders of shares of Parity Stock, then each Holder and each holder of Parity Stock shall receive a percentage of
the Liquidation Funds equal to the full amount of Liquidation Funds payable to such Holder and such holder of Parity Stock as a liquidation
preference, in accordance with their respective certificate of designations (or equivalent), as a percentage of the full amount of Liquidation
Funds payable to all holders of Preferred Shares and all holders of shares of Parity Stock. To the extent necessary, the Company shall
cause such actions to be taken by each of its Subsidiaries so as to enable, to the maximum extent permitted by law, the proceeds of a
Liquidation Event to be distributed to the Holders in accordance with this Section 12. All the preferential amounts to be paid to the
Holders under this Section 12 shall be paid or set apart for payment before the payment or setting apart for payment of any amount for,
or the distribution of any Liquidation Funds of the Company to the holders of shares of Junior Stock in connection with a Liquidation
Event as to which this Section 12 applies.
13.
Distribution of Assets
. In addition to any adjustments pursuant to Section 7(a) and Section 8, if the Company shall declare or
make any dividend or other distributions of its assets (or rights to acquire its assets) to any or all holders of shares of Common Stock,
by way of return of capital or otherwise (including without limitation, any distribution of cash, stock or other securities, property
or options by way of a dividend, spin off, reclassification, corporate rearrangement, scheme of arrangement or other similar transaction)
(the “
Distributions
”), then each Holder, as holders of Preferred Shares, will be entitled to such Distributions as
if such Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable upon complete conversion of the Preferred Shares (without taking
into account any limitations or restrictions on the convertibility of the Preferred Shares and assuming for such purpose that the Preferred
Share was converted at the Alternate Conversion Price as of the applicable record date) immediately prior to the date on which a record
is taken for such Distribution or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders of Common Stock are to be determined
for such Distributions (
provided
,
however
, that to the extent that such Holder’s right to participate in any such
Distribution would result in such Holder and the other Attribution Parties exceeding the Maximum Percentage, then such Holder shall not
be entitled to participate in such Distribution to such extent of the Maximum Percentage (and shall not be entitled to beneficial ownership
of such shares of Common Stock as a result of such Distribution (and beneficial ownership) to such extent of any such excess) and the
portion of such Distribution shall be held in abeyance for the benefit of such Holder until such time or times as its right thereto would
not result in such Holder and the other Attribution Parties exceeding the Maximum Percentage, at which time or times, if any, such Holder
shall be granted such Distribution (and any Distributions declared or made on such initial Distribution or on any subsequent Distribution
held similarly in abeyance) to the same extent as if there had been no such limitation).
14.
Vote to Change the Terms of or Issue Preferred Shares
. In addition to any other rights provided by law, except where the vote
or written consent of the holders of a greater number of shares is required by law or by another provision of the Certificate of Incorporation,
without first obtaining the affirmative vote at a meeting duly called for such purpose or the written consent without a meeting of at
least 51% of the holders, voting together as a single class, the Company shall not: (a) amend or repeal any provision of, or add any
provision to, its Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws, or file any certificate of designations or articles of amendment of any series
of shares of preferred stock, if such action would adversely alter or change in any respect the preferences, rights, privileges or powers,
or restrictions provided for the benefit of the Preferred Shares hereunder, regardless of whether any such action shall be by means of
amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation or by merger, consolidation or otherwise; (b) increase or decrease (other than by conversion)
the authorized number of Preferred Shares; (c) without limiting any provision of Section 2, create or authorize (by reclassification
or otherwise) any new class or series of Senior Preferred Stock or Parity Stock; (d) purchase, repurchase or redeem any shares of Junior
Stock (other than pursuant to the terms of the Company’s equity incentive plans and options and other equity awards granted under
such plans (that have in good faith been approved by the Board)); (e) without limiting any provision of Section 2, pay dividends or make
any other distribution on any shares of any Junior Stock; (f) issue any Preferred Shares other than as contemplated hereby or pursuant
to the Securities Purchase Agreement; or (g) without limiting any provision of Section 9, whether or not prohibited by the terms of the
Preferred Shares, circumvent a right of the Preferred Shares hereunder.
15.

the Company will forthwith issue and deliver upon the order of such Holder a new Preferred Share Certificate (in accordance with Section
16(d)) (or evidence of the transfer of such Book-Entry), registered as such Holder may request, representing the outstanding number of
Preferred Shares being transferred by such Holder and, if less than the entire outstanding number of Preferred Shares is being transferred,
a new Preferred Share Certificate (in accordance with Section 16(d)) to such Holder representing the outstanding number of Preferred
Shares not being transferred (or evidence of such remaining Preferred Shares in a Book-Entry for such Holder). Such Holder and any assignee,
by acceptance of the Preferred Share Certificate or evidence of Book-Entry issuance, as applicable, acknowledge and agree that, by reason
of the provisions of Section 4(c)(i) following conversion or redemption of any of the Preferred Shares, the outstanding number of Preferred
Shares represented by the Preferred Shares may be less than the number of Preferred Shares stated on the face of the Preferred Shares.
(b)
Lost, Stolen or Mutilated Preferred Share Certificate
. Upon receipt by the Company of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the
Company of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of a Preferred Share Certificate (as to which a written certification and the indemnification
contemplated below shall suffice as such evidence), and, in the case of loss, theft or destruction, of any indemnification undertaking
by the applicable Holder to the Company in customary and reasonable form and, in the case of mutilation, upon surrender and cancellation
of such Preferred Share Certificate, the Company shall execute and deliver to such Holder a new Preferred Share Certificate (in accordance
with Section 16(d)) representing the applicable outstanding number of Preferred Shares.
(c)
Preferred Share Certificate and Book-Entries Exchangeable for Different Denominations and Forms
. Each Preferred Share Certificate
is exchangeable, upon the surrender hereof by the applicable Holder at the principal office of the Company, for a new Preferred Share

outstanding number of the Preferred Shares in the original Preferred Share Certificate, and each such new Preferred Share Certificate
and/or new Book-Entry, as applicable, will represent such portion of such outstanding number of Preferred Shares from the original Preferred
Share Certificate as is designated in writing by such Holder at the time of such surrender. Each Book-Entry may be exchanged into one
or more new Preferred Share Certificates or split by the applicable Holder by delivery of a written notice to the Company into two or
more new Book-Entries (in accordance with Section 16(d)) representing, in the aggregate, the outstanding number of the Preferred Shares
in the original Book-Entry, and each such new Book-Entry and/or new Preferred Share Certificate, as applicable, will represent such portion
of such outstanding number of Preferred Shares from the original Book-Entry as is designated in writing by such Holder at the time of
such surrender.

Preferred Shares remaining outstanding (or in the case of a new Preferred Share Certificate or new Book-Entry being issued pursuant to
Section 16(a) or Section 16(c), the number of Preferred Shares designated by such Holder) which, when added to the number of Preferred
Shares represented by the other new Preferred Share Certificates or other new Book-Entry, as applicable, issued in connection with such

Book-Entry, as applicable, immediately prior to such issuance of new Preferred Share Certificate or new Book-Entry, as applicable, and

The remedies provided in this Certificate
of Designations shall be cumulative and in addition to all other remedies available under this Certificate of Designations and any of
the other Transaction Documents, at law or in equity (including a decree of specific performance and/or other injunctive relief), and
nothing herein shall limit any Holder’s right to pursue actual and consequential damages for any failure by the Company to comply
with the terms of this Certificate of Designations. No failure on the part of a Holder to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right,
power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise by such Holder of any right, power
or remedy preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy. In addition, the exercise
of any right or remedy of a Holder at law or equity or under this Certificate of Designations or any of the documents shall not be deemed
to be an election of such Holder’s rights or remedies under such documents or at law or equity. The Company covenants to each Holder
that there shall be no characterization concerning this instrument other than as expressly provided herein. Amounts set forth or provided
for herein with respect to payments, conversion and the like (and the computation thereof) shall be the amounts to be received by a Holder
and shall not, except as expressly provided herein, be subject to any other obligation of the Company (or the performance thereof). No
failure on the part of a Holder to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise by such Holder of any right, power or remedy preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy. In addition, the exercise of any right or remedy of any Holder at law or
equity or under Preferred Shares or any of the documents shall not be deemed to be an election of such Holder’s rights or remedies
under such documents or at law or equity. The Company acknowledges that a breach by it of its obligations hereunder will cause irreparable
harm to the Holders and that the remedy at law for any such breach may be inadequate. The Company therefore agrees that, in the event
of any such breach or threatened breach, each Holder shall be entitled, in addition to all other available remedies, to specific performance
and/or temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive or other equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction in any such
case without the necessity of proving actual damages and without posting a bond or other security. The Company shall provide all information

rights and involving a claim under this Certificate of Designations, then the Company shall pay the costs incurred by such Holder for
such collection, enforcement or action or in connection with such bankruptcy, reorganization, receivership or other proceeding, including,
without limitation, attorneys’ fees and disbursements. The Company expressly acknowledges and agrees that no amounts due under

paid for each Preferred Share was less than the original Stated Value thereof.

The terms “including,” “includes,” “include” and words of like import shall be construed broadly

of Designations and not otherwise defined herein, but defined in the other Transaction Documents, shall have the meanings ascribed to
such terms on the Initial Issuance Date in such other Transaction Documents unless otherwise consented to in writing by the Holder

Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver
. No failure or delay on the part of a Holder in the exercise of any power, right or privilege
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such power, right or privilege preclude
other or further exercise thereof or of any other right, power or privilege. No waiver shall be effective unless it is in writing and
signed by an authorized representative of the waiving party. This Certificate of Designations shall be deemed to be jointly drafted by
