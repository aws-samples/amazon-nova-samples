If a Person other than the Indenture Trustee is appointed by the Issuer as Note Registrar, the Issuer will give the Indenture Trustee
 and Owner Trustee prompt written notice of the appointment of such Note Registrar and of the location, and any change in the location, of the Note Register, and the Indenture Trustee shall have the right to inspect the Note Register at all reasonable

 non-U.S. Person outside the United States pursuant to available exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and all other applicable securities laws.

 Trustee, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Notes, in any authorized denominations, of the same class and a like aggregate principal amount.

 aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Notes to be exchanged at such office or agency.  Whenever any Notes are so surrendered for exchange, subject to Sections 2.10 and 2.12 hereof, if the requirements of Section 8-401(1) of the UCC are
 met the Issuer shall execute and upon its request the Indenture Trustee shall authenticate and the Noteholder shall obtain from the Indenture Trustee, the Notes which the Noteholder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
All Notes issued upon any registration of transfer or exchange of Notes shall be the valid obligations of the Issuer, evidencing the
 same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture, as the Notes surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.
Every Note presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange shall be (i) duly endorsed by, or be accompanied by a
 written instrument of transfer in the forms attached to Exhibits A-1, A-2, A-3, B, C, D, E-1, E-2 and E-3 duly executed by, the Holder thereof or such Holder’s attorney duly authorized in writing, with (if required by the Note Registrar) such
 signature guaranteed by an “eligible guarantor institution” meeting the requirements of the Note Registrar which requirements include membership or participation in Securities Transfer Agents Medallion Program (“
STAMP
”) or such other “signature guarantee program” as may be determined by the Note Registrar in addition to, or in substitution for, STAMP, all in accordance with the Exchange Act, and (ii) accompanied by such
 other documents as the Indenture Trustee may require.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of any sale or other transfer of a Class A Note, Class B Note, Class C Note or Class D Note
 (or a beneficial interest therein), the purchaser
15
or other transferee of such Note shall be required or deemed to represent and warrant to the Note Registrar that it is not and will not be, and is not
 acting on behalf of or investing the assets of, an entity that is or will be (a) an “employee benefit plan” (as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“
ERISA
”)) that is subject to Title I of ERISA, (b) a “plan” (as defined in Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code) that is subject to Section 4975 of the Code, (c) an entity whose underlying assets are deemed to include assets
 of an employee benefit plan or a plan described in (a) or (b) above by reason of such employee benefit plan’s or plan’s investment in the entity (collectively, a “
Plan
”) or (d)
 an employee benefit plan, a plan or similar arrangement that is not a Plan but is subject to federal, state, local or non-U.S. laws or regulations substantially similar to Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code (collectively, “
Similar Law
” and a “
Similar Law Plan
”) unless such purchaser’s or transferee’s acquisition, holding and
 disposition of a Class A Note, Class B Note, Class C Note or Class D Note (or a beneficial interest therein) will not constitute or result in a non-exempt prohibited transaction under Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, or a violation
 of any provision of any Similar Law.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of any sale or other transfer of a Class E Note (or a beneficial interest in any such
 Note), the transferee of such Note shall be required or deemed to represent and warrant to the Note Registrar that it is not and will not be, and is not acting on behalf of or investing the assets of, an entity that is or will be a Plan or a Similar
 Law Plan.
Each holder of a Note (or a beneficial interest therein) shall provide the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee with the Noteholder Tax
 Identification Information and, to the extent FATCA Withholding Tax is applicable, the Noteholder FATCA Information.  In addition, each holder of such Note will be deemed to understand that the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee have the right to
 withhold interest payable with respect to the Note (without any corresponding gross-up) on any beneficial owner of an interest in a Note that fails to comply with the foregoing requirements and any other requirements under FATCA.
The Issuer represents, warrants and covenants to the Indenture Trustee that the Issuer will provide or will cause to be provided, upon request, (i) information to the extent necessary
 or required for the Indenture Trustee to determine whether payments made or to be made by the Issuer with respect to the Notes are payments of U.S. source income subject to U.S. federal withholding tax or (ii) such additional information to the
 extent necessary or required that it may have to assist the Indenture Trustee or the Note Paying Agent in making informational reports.  The Indenture Trustee shall withhold from any payments with respect to the Notes as required by applicable law.
The transferee of any Class E Notes acknowledges that it is deemed to represent that, as a result of its own activities separate from those of the Issuer, it would not be required to
 treat income from the Class E Notes as effectively connected to a United States trade or business of a person that is not a U.S. person (within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30)), and it further acknowledges that the Indenture provides that no
 holder of a Class E Note shall provide the Issuer with either an IRS Form W-8ECI (or successor form) or an IRS Form W-8IMY (or successor form) to which an IRS Form W-8ECI (or successor form) is attached (either directly or as part of another form
 attached to such IRS Form W-8IMY).
16
No portion of the Class E Notes or any interest therein may be transferred, directly or indirectly, to any Person which would provide an IRS Form W‑8ECI or IRS Form W‑8IMY with an attached IRS Form
 W‑8ECI in response to the withholding requirements of the Code.
Each holder of a Class E Note (or a beneficial interest in any such Note), by acceptance of such Note or such interest in such Note, acknowledges that it is deemed to
 represent (A) either (I) is not and will not become for U.S. federal income tax purposes a Flow-Through Entity or (II) if it is or becomes a Flow-Through Entity, then (x) none of the direct or indirect beneficial owners of any of the interests in
 such Flow-Through Entity has or ever will have more than 50% of the value of its interest in such Flow-Through Entity attributable to the interest of such Flow-Through Entity in the Class E Notes and any equity interests in the Issuer, and (y) it
 is not and will not be a principal purpose of the arrangement involving the investment of such Flow-Through Entity in any Class E Note to permit any partnership to satisfy the 100 partner limitation of section 1.7704-1(h)(1)(ii) of the Treasury
 Regulations necessary for such partnership not to be classified as a publicly traded partnership under the Code, (B) it will not sell, assign, transfer, pledge or otherwise convey any participating interest in any Note or any financial instrument
 or contract the value of which is determined by reference in whole or in part to any Note, (C) it is not acquiring and will not sell, transfer, assign, participate, pledge or otherwise dispose of any Class E Note (or interest therein)
if such acquisition, sale, transfer, assignment, participation, pledge or disposition is through, or would cause
any Class E Note (or interest therein) to be
 marketed on or through an “established securities market” within the meaning of Section 7704(b) of the Code, including, without limitation, an interdealer quotation system that regularly disseminates firm buy or sell quotations and (D) it does
 not and will not beneficially own any Class E Note (or any beneficial interest therein) in an amount that is less than the minimum denomination for such Class E Note.  To the extent a holder of a Class E Note (or a beneficial interest therein) is
 unable to make each of the representations contained in the foregoing clauses (A), (B), (C) and (D), such holder acknowledges that it is deemed to agree to provide an opinion of nationally recognized U.S. tax counsel reasonably acceptable to the
 Issuer that its acquisition of a Class E Note (or any beneficial interest therein) will not cause the Issuer to be treated as a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation.  Any transfer of a Class E Note (or any beneficial interest
 therein) that does not comply with the foregoing requirements will be deemed null and void ab initio.
No holder of a Class E Note shall acquire, sell, transfer, assign, participate, pledge, or dispose of any Class E Note or interest therein, if such acquisition, sale, transfer,
 assignment, participation, pledge or disposition is through, or would cause any Class E Note or interest therein, to be marketed on or through, an “established securities market” within the meaning of Section 7704(b)(1) of the Code, including,
 without limitation, an over-the-counter market or an interdealer quotation system that regularly disseminates firm buy or sell quotations.
No service charge shall be made to a Noteholder for any registration of transfer or exchange of Notes, but the Note Registrar may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax
 or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Notes, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 2.3 or 9.6 not involving any transfer.
Prior to any Notes (other than the Class E Notes) which are retained on the Closing Date or acquired after the Closing Date by the Sponsor or an entity that is deemed to be an
 affiliate
17
of the Sponsor for U.S. federal income tax purposes being sold, pledged or transferred, the Sponsor and the Indenture Trustee shall have received an Opinion of Counsel that such Notes will be
 characterized as indebtedness for U.S. federal income tax purposes, if held by persons other than a beneficial owner of the equity in the Issuer or its Affiliates. Prior to any Class E Notes which are retained on the Closing Date or acquired after
 the Closing Date by the Sponsor or an entity that is deemed to be an affiliate of the Sponsor for U.S. federal income tax purposes being sold, pledged, or transferred, the Sponsor and the Indenture Trustee shall have received an Opinion of Counsel
 that such Class E Notes should be characterized as indebtedness for U.S. federal income tax purposes, if held by persons other than a beneficial owner of the equity in the Issuer or its Affiliates.
The preceding provisions of this section notwithstanding, the Issuer shall not be required to make and the Note Registrar shall not register transfers or exchanges of Notes selected
 for redemption or of any Note for a period of 15 days preceding the due date for any payment with respect to the Note.
Section 2.5
Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Notes
.  If (i) any mutilated Note is surrendered to the Indenture Trustee, or the Indenture Trustee receives evidence to its
 satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Note, and (ii) there is delivered to the Indenture Trustee such security, surety bond, or indemnity as may be required by it to hold the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee harmless, then, in the
 absence of notice to the Issuer, the Note Registrar or the Indenture Trustee that such Note has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, and provided that the requirements of Section 8-405 of the UCC are met, the Issuer shall execute and upon its
 request the Indenture Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in exchange for or in lieu of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Note, a replacement Note;
provided,

 however,
that if any such destroyed, lost or stolen Note, but not a mutilated Note, shall have become or within seven days shall be due and payable, or shall have been called for redemption, instead of issuing a replacement Note, the
 Issuer may direct the Indenture Trustee, in writing, to pay such destroyed, lost or stolen Note when so due or payable or upon the Redemption Date, without surrender thereof.  If, after the delivery of such replacement Note or payment of a
 destroyed, lost or stolen Note pursuant to the proviso to the preceding sentence, a bona fide purchaser of the original Note in lieu of which such replacement Note was issued presents for payment such original Note, the Issuer and the Indenture
 Trustee shall be entitled to recover such replacement Note (or such payment) from the Person to whom it was delivered or any Person taking such replacement Note from such Person to whom such replacement Note was delivered or any assignee of such
 Person, except a bona fide purchaser, and shall be entitled to recover upon the security, surety bond or indemnity provided therefor to the extent of any loss, damage, cost or expense incurred by the Issuer or the Indenture Trustee in connection

 may have acquired in any manner whatsoever, and all Notes so delivered shall be promptly canceled by the Indenture Trustee.  No Notes shall be authenticated in lieu of or in exchange for any Notes canceled as provided in this Section, except as
 expressly permitted by this Indenture.  All canceled Notes may be held or disposed of by the Indenture Trustee in accordance with its standard retention or disposal policy as in effect at the time unless the Issuer shall timely direct by an Issuer

 2.12.  Unless and until definitive, fully registered Notes ( “
Definitive Notes
”) have been issued to all Note Owners pursuant to Section 2.12(a), the provisions of this Section
 shall be in full force and effect and, with respect to any Book-Entry Notes:
(i)
the Note Registrar and the Indenture Trustee shall be entitled to deal with the Clearing Agency for all purposes of this
 Indenture (including the payment of principal of and interest on such Notes and the giving of instructions or directions hereunder) as the sole Holder of such Notes, and shall have no obligation to the related Note Owners;

(iv)
whenever this Indenture requires or permits actions to be taken based upon instructions or directions of Noteholders
 evidencing a specified percentage of the Outstanding Amount of the Notes, the Clearing Agency shall be deemed to represent such percentage in respect of which it has received instructions to such effect from Note Owners and/or Clearing Agency
 Participants owning or representing, respectively, Book-Entry Notes and has delivered such instructions to the Indenture Trustee;
(v)
Note Owners of any Book-Entry Notes may receive copies of any reports sent to Noteholders pursuant to this Indenture,

(vi)
notwithstanding any provision to the contrary herein, so long as a Book-Entry Note is held by or on behalf of the
 Clearing Agency, transfers of a Book-Entry Note, in whole or in part, shall only be made in accordance with this Section 2.10.
(A)
subject to clauses (B) through (C) of this Section 2.10(vi) and Section 2.12, transfers of a Book-Entry Note shall be

 Global Note
.  A holder of a beneficial interest in a Temporary Regulation S Global Note may not transfer any of its
interest in such Temporary Regulation S Global Note to a Person who wishes to take delivery thereof in the
 form of a Global Note until the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period.  After the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, Regulation S Global Notes will be represented by a Permanent Regulation S Global Note.  If a holder of a
 beneficial interest in a Permanent Regulation S Global Note wishes to transfer all or a part of its interest in such Permanent Regulation S Global Note to a Person who wishes to take delivery thereof in the form of a Global Note, such holder may,
 subject to the terms hereof and the rules and procedures of the Clearing Agency, exchange or cause the exchange of such interest for an equivalent beneficial interest in a Global Note of the same Class.  Upon receipt by the Note Registrar of (A)
 instructions from the Clearing Agency directing the Note Registrar to cause such Global Note to be increased by an amount equal to such beneficial interest in such Permanent Regulation S Global Note but not less than the minimum denomination
 applicable to the related Note, (B) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit F-1 hereto given by the prospective transferee of such beneficial interest and stating, among other things, that such transferee acquiring such beneficial
 interest in a Global Note is a Qualified Institutional Buyer, is obtaining such beneficial interest in a transaction pursuant to Rule 144A and in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any state of the United States or any other
 applicable jurisdiction, and (C) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit F-1 hereto given by the prospective transferor of such beneficial interest, then the Note Registrar will instruct the Clearing Agency to reduce the aggregate
 principal amount of such Permanent Regulation S Global Note by the aggregate principal amount of the beneficial interest in such Permanent Regulation S Global Note to be transferred, increase the aggregate principal amount of the Global Note
 specified in such instructions by an aggregate principal amount equal to such reduction in such aggregate principal amount of the Permanent Regulation S Global Note and make the corresponding adjustments to the applicable participants’ accounts.
(C)
Global Note to Regulation S Global Note
.  If a
 holder of a beneficial interest in a Global Note wishes to transfer all or a part of its interest in such Global Note to a Person who wishes to take delivery thereof in the form of a Regulation S Global Note, such holder may, subject to the terms
 hereof and the rules and procedures of the Clearing Agency exchange or cause the exchange of such interest for an equivalent beneficial interest in a Regulation S Global Note of the same Class.  Upon receipt by the Note Registrar of (A)
 instructions from the Clearing Agency directing the Note Registrar to cause the aggregate principal amount of such Regulation S Global Note to be increased by an amount equal to such beneficial interest in such Global Note but not less than the
 minimum denomination applicable to the Notes to be exchanged, and (B) a certificate substantially in the form of
Exhibit F-2
hereto given by the prospective transferee of
 such beneficial
22
interest and stating, among other things, that such transferee acquiring such beneficial interest
 in a Regulation S Global Note is a Regulation S non-U.S. Person located outside the United States and such transfer is being made pursuant to Regulation S of the Securities Act, then the Note Registrar will instruct the Clearing Agency to reduce
 the aggregate principal amount of such Global Note by the
aggregate principal amount of the interest in such Global Note to be transferred, increase the aggregate principal amount of the Regulation S Global Note specified in such
 instructions by an aggregate principal amount equal to such reduction in the aggregate principal amount of the Global Note and make the corresponding adjustments to the applicable participants’ accounts.
(D)
Other Exchanges
.  In the event that a Global
 Note or Regulation S Global Note is exchanged for one or more Definitive Notes pursuant to Section 2.12, such Notes may be exchanged for one another only in accordance with such procedures as are substantially consistent with the provisions above
 and any other applicable terms of this Indenture (including certification requirements intended to ensure that such transfers (i) are to the Seller or an Affiliate of the Seller, (ii) comply with Rule 144A, (iii) are to Regulation S non-U.S.
 Persons and otherwise comply with Regulation S, or (iv) pursuant to available exemptions from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and all other applicable securities laws, as the case may be) and as may be from time to time adopted
 by the Issuer and the Indenture Trustee.
Section 2.11
Notices to Clearing Agency
.  Whenever a notice or other communication to the Noteholders is required under this Indenture, unless and until any Definitive Notes shall
 have been issued to Note Owners pursuant to Section 2.12(a), the Indenture Trustee shall give all such notices and communications specified herein to be given to the Noteholders to the Clearing Agency, and shall have no obligation to the Note
 Owners.  If any Definitive Notes shall have been issued to Note Owners pursuant to Section 2.12(b), then the Indenture Trustee shall also give to the related Noteholders any such notices and communications specified herein to be given to

Section 2.12
Definitive Notes
.
(a)
If (i) Exeter advises the Indenture Trustee in writing that the Clearing Agency is no longer willing, qualified or able to properly
 discharge its responsibilities with respect to the Notes, and Exeter is unable to locate a qualified successor or (ii) after the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Majority Noteholders advise the Indenture Trustee through the Clearing Agency in
 writing that the continuation of a book-entry system through the Clearing Agency is no longer in the best interests of the Note Owners, then the Clearing Agency shall notify all Note Owners and the Indenture Trustee of the occurrence of any such
 event and of the availability of Definitive Notes to Note Owners requesting the same.  Upon surrender to the Indenture Trustee of the typewritten Note or Notes representing the Book-Entry Notes by the Clearing Agency, in accordance with this
 Section 2.12(a) and accompanied by registration instructions, the Issuer shall execute and the Indenture Trustee shall authenticate the Definitive Notes in accordance with the instructions of the Clearing Agency.  Additionally, Exeter may instruct
 the Indenture Trustee to issue a Definitive Note to the Seller or an Affiliate of the Seller, or to a Person acquiring a
23
Definitive Note from the Seller or an Affiliate of the Seller, in accordance with the applicable terms of this Section 2.12 and Section 2.4 hereof.
(b)
(i)
If Exeter provides notice to the Indenture Trustee in writing that the Seller or an Affiliate of the Seller is acquiring any Book-Entry Notes after the Closing Date and
that such Person has elected to
 exchange, at the time of such acquisition, such Book-Entry Notes for Definitive Notes of the same Class, such notice shall be provided no later than two (2) Business Days prior to such Person’s acquisition of such Notes and shall specify (i) the
 date of such acquisition and exchange (the “
DWAC Decrease Date
”), (ii) the initial principal amount of the Book-Entry Notes of such Class of Notes immediately prior to the DWAC Decrease Date (the “
Pre-DWAC Initial Principal Amount
”),
 (iii) the amount by which the Pre-DWAC Initial Principal Amount will be decreased in connection with issuance of the corresponding Definitive Notes (the “
DWAC Decrease Amount
”), (iv) the initial principal amount of the Book-Entry Notes of
 such Class of Notes, as decreased by the DWAC Decrease Amount (the “
Post-DWAC Initial Principal Amount
”), and (v) the DTC participant number of the transferor.  On the DWAC Decrease Date, the transferor of the Notes that are the subject of
 such exchange will initiate, or cause to be initiated, a DWAC with the Clearing Agency in order to decrease the Pre-DWAC Initial Principal Amount of the Book-Entry Notes of such Class of Notes by the DWAC Decrease Amount.  In connection with such
 DWAC Decrease Amount, the Indenture Trustee shall issue one or more Definitive Notes corresponding with such DWAC Decrease Amount to the Seller or such Affiliate, as applicable, in accordance with the instructions of Exeter and in accordance with
 Section 2.4 hereof.
(ii)
If Exeter provides notice to the Indenture Trustee in writing that the Seller or an Affiliate of the Seller is transferring any such
 Definitive Notes issued pursuant to Section 2.12(b) to another Person, the Indenture Trustee shall, in accordance with the instructions of Exeter and in accordance with the terms of Sections 2.4 and 2.10 hereof, as applicable, and together with any
 information, direction or certification from the related transferor or transferee that the Indenture Trustee reasonably requests in order to effectuate such transfer to a Person who is not the Seller or an Affiliate of the Seller, either (i) issue
 one or more Definitive Notes in respect of the Definitive Notes to be transferred, or (ii) in the event that the transferee desires that such Definitive Notes be exchanged for one or more Book-Entry Notes that are Global Notes or Regulation S
 Global Notes of the same Class of Notes, Exeter shall turn in such Definitive Notes to the Indenture Trustee for cancelation, and provide notice to the Indenture Trustee in writing no later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Seller’s or an
 Affiliate of the Seller’s transfer of such Definitive Notes and shall specify (i) the date of acquisition (the “
DWAC Increase Date
”), (ii) the related Pre-DWAC Initial
 Principal Amount, (iii) the amount by which the related Pre-DWAC Initial Principal Amount will be increased in connection with cancelation of such Definitive Notes (the “
DWAC Increase
 Amount
”), (iv) the related post-DWAC Initial Principal Amount, and (v) the DTC participant number of the transferee.  On the DWAC Increase Date, the transferee of the Notes that are the subject of such exchange will initiate a DWAC
 with the Clearing Agency in order to increase the related Pre-DWAC Initial Principal Amount of the Book-Entry Notes of such Class of Notes by the DWAC Increase Amount which shall correspond with the initial principal amount of the Definitive Notes
 turned into the Indenture Trustee for cancelation.
(c)
If Exeter provides notice to the Indenture Trustee in writing that (x) the Seller or an Affiliate of the Seller has acquired any
 Book-Entry Notes (other than any Global Notes or Regulation S Global Notes) after the Closing Date and (y) the Seller or such Affiliate of the
24
Seller proposes to transfer such Notes to another Person who is not the Seller or an Affiliate of the Seller, Exeter
 shall deliver to the Indenture Trustee appropriate documentation, in accordance with the terms of Sections 2.4 and 2.10, as applicable, and any information, direction or certification from the related transferor or transferee that the Indenture
 Trustee reasonably requests in order to effectuate such transfer to a Person who is not the Seller or an Affiliate of the Seller, evidencing
that such transfers are being made in accordance with transfer restrictions applicable to Global
 Notes or Regulation S Global Notes, and such transferred Notes shall for all purposes hereunder be Global Notes or Regulation S Global Notes, as applicable, from and after the transfer of such Notes to such other Person who is not the Seller or an
 Affiliate of the Seller.  None of the Issuer, the Note Registrar or the Indenture Trustee shall be liable for any delay in delivery of such instructions and may conclusively rely on, and shall be fully protected in relying on, such instructions.  The
 Issuer represents that any indebtedness issued hereunder is excluded from the definition of “covered security” under Treasury Regulation 1.6045-1(a)(15) because such indebtedness is subject to Internal Revenue Code section 1272(a)(6).
(d)
None of the Issuer, the Note Registrar or the Indenture Trustee shall be liable for following any instructions contemplated by this
 Section 2.12 including any delay in delivery of such instructions and may conclusively rely on, and shall be fully protected in relying on, such instructions, including the DWAC requests initiated through the Clearing Agency.  Upon the issuance of
 any Definitive Notes in accordance with the terms of this Section 2.12, the Indenture Trustee shall recognize the Holders of such Definitive Notes as Noteholders.  The Issuer represents that any indebtedness issued hereunder is excluded from the
 definition of “covered security” under Treasury Regulation 1.6045-1(a)(15) because such indebtedness is subject to Internal Revenue Code section 1272(a)(6).  Temporary Regulation S Global Notes may not be issued as Definitive Notes.

 Holder of such Note shall thereafter, as an unsecured general creditor, look only to the Issuer for payment thereof (but only to the extent of the amounts so paid to the Issuer), and all liability of the Indenture Trustee or such Note Paying Agent
 with respect to such trust money shall thereupon cease;
provided, however,

 do one or more of the following (subject to Section 5.5):
(i)
institute Proceedings in its own name and as trustee of an express trust for the collection of all amounts then payable

(I)
such Event of Default is of the type described in Section 5.1(i) or (ii), or
(II)
either
(x)
the Holders of 100% of the Outstanding Amount of the Notes consent thereto, or
(y)
the proceeds of such sale or liquidation distributable to the Noteholders are sufficient to discharge in full all amounts
 then due and unpaid upon such Notes for principal and interest, or
(z)
the Indenture Trustee determines that the Trust Estate will not continue to provide sufficient funds for the payment of
 principal of and interest on the Notes as they would have become due if the Notes had not been declared due and payable, and the Indenture Trustee provides prior written notice to the Issuer (who shall deliver such notice to the Rating Agencies)
 and obtains the consent of Holders of 66-2/3% of the Outstanding Amount of the Notes.
In determining such sufficiency or insufficiency with respect to clauses (y) and (z), the Indenture Trustee may, but need not, obtain

41
Independent investment banking or accounting firm of national reputation as to the feasibility of such proposed action and as to the sufficiency of the Trust Estate for such purpose.

 direction;
provided, however,
that, subject to Article VI, the Indenture Trustee need

 than 25% of the Outstanding Amount thereof;
provided, however,

 likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action.

The Indenture Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of any event or information, including any Default or Event of Default, unless
 a Responsible Officer of the Indenture Trustee has actual knowledge or receives written notice of such event or information. Absent actual knowledge or receipt of written notice in accordance with this Section, the Indenture Trustee may

 Indenture Trustee has received notice or has actual knowledge as described in this Section.  The Indenture Trustee’s receipt of delivery of any reports or other information publicly available does not constitute actual or constructive knowledge or
 notice to the Indenture Trustee unless the Indenture Trustee has an obligation to review its content. Knowledge of the Indenture Trustee shall not be attributed or imputed to Citibank, N.A.’s other roles in the transaction, and knowledge of the
 Backup Servicer (including the Backup Servicer in

its capacity as the successor Servicer if so appointed) shall not be attributed or imputed to the Indenture Trustee (in each case, other than instances

 Responsible Officer of the Indenture Trustee, the Indenture Trustee shall mail to each Noteholder notice of the Default within 30 days after such knowledge or notice occurs.  Except in the case of a Default in payment of principal of or interest on

 principal and interest due and paid on the Notes. The Indenture Trustee shall have the right to change the way such statements are distributed in order to make such distribution more convenient and/or more accessible to the above Holders and the

Section 6.7
Compensation and Indemnity
.
(a)
Pursuant to Section 5.7(a) and Section 8.3 of the Sale and Servicing Agreement, the Issuer shall pay, to the Indenture Trustee and the
 Backup Servicer (subject to any applicable caps) from time to time compensation for its services.  The Indenture Trustee’s compensation shall not be limited by any law on compensation of a trustee of an express trust.  The Issuer shall reimburse,
 the Indenture Trustee and the Backup Servicer (subject to any applicable caps) for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred or made by it, including costs of collection, in addition to the compensation for its services.  Such expenses shall
 include the reasonable compensation and expenses, disbursements and advances of the Indenture Trustee’s and the Backup Servicer’s agents, counsel, accountants and experts.  The Issuer shall indemnify the Indenture Trustee, the Backup Servicer
 (including the Backup Servicer in its capacity as the successor Servicer if so appointed), and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents against any and all losses, liabilities or expenses (including reasonable fees and expenses of
 outside counsel, which shall include any reasonable fees and expenses of outside counsel incurred in connection with (i) any enforcement of the indemnification obligation hereunder or (ii) the successful defense, in whole or in part, of any claim
 that the Indenture Trustee or Backup Servicer (including the Backup Servicer in its capacity as the successor Servicer if so appointed) breached its standard of care) incurred by each of them in connection with the acceptance or the administration
 of the trusts hereunder and the performance of its duties hereunder and under the Basic Documents.  The Indenture Trustee or the Backup Servicer (including the Backup Servicer in its capacity as the successor Servicer if so appointed) shall notify
 the Issuer and the Servicer
54
promptly of any claim for which it may seek indemnity.  Failure by the Indenture Trustee or the Backup Servicer (including the Backup Servicer in its
 capacity as the successor Servicer if so appointed) to so notify the Issuer and the Servicer shall not relieve the Issuer of its obligations hereunder or the Servicer of its obligations under Article XI of the Sale and Servicing Agreement.  The
 Issuer shall defend, or shall cause the Servicer to defend, the claim, and the Indenture Trustee or the Backup Servicer (including the Backup Servicer in its capacity as the successor Servicer if so appointed) may have separate counsel and the Issuer
 shall pay, or cause the Servicer to pay, the fees and expenses of such counsel.  Neither the Issuer nor the Servicer need to reimburse any expense or indemnify against any loss, liability or expense incurred by the Indenture Trustee or the Backup
 Servicer (including the Backup Servicer in its capacity as the successor Servicer if so appointed) through the Indenture Trustee’s or the Backup Servicer’s (including the Backup Servicer in its capacity as the successor Servicer if so appointed) own
 willful misconduct, gross negligence or bad faith.
(b)
The Issuer’s and the Servicer’s obligations to the Indenture Trustee or the Backup Servicer (including the Backup Servicer in its
 capacity as the successor Servicer if so appointed) pursuant to this Section shall survive the discharge or assignment of this Indenture or the earlier resignation or removal of the Indenture Trustee or the Backup Servicer (including the Backup
 Servicer in its capacity as the successor Servicer if so appointed).  When the Indenture Trustee or the Backup Servicer (including the Backup Servicer in its capacity as the successor Servicer if so appointed) incurs expenses after the occurrence
 of an Event of Default specified in Section 5.1(v) or (vi) with respect to the Issuer, the expenses are intended to constitute expenses of administration under Title 11 of the United States Code or any other applicable federal or State bankruptcy,
 insolvency or similar law.  Notwithstanding anything else set forth in this Indenture or the Basic Documents, the Indenture Trustee agrees that the obligations of the Issuer (but not the Servicer) to the Indenture Trustee hereunder and under the
 Basic Documents shall be recourse to the Trust Estate only and specifically shall not be recourse to the assets of any Certificateholder or Noteholder.  In addition, the Indenture Trustee agrees that its recourse (for its own account or the account
 of the Backup Servicer (including the Backup Servicer in its capacity as the successor Servicer if so appointed)) to the Issuer and the Trust Estate shall be limited to the right to receive the distributions referred to in Section 5.7(a) of the
 Sale and Servicing Agreement or Section 5.6 of this Indenture, as applicable.

 satisfaction of the Rating Agency Condition.  The successor Indenture Trustee shall mail a notice of its succession to the Noteholders.  The retiring Indenture Trustee shall promptly transfer all property held by it as Indenture Trustee to the

 of this Section shall not become effective until acceptance of appointment by the successor Indenture Trustee pursuant to Section 6.8 and payment of all fees and expenses owed to the outgoing Indenture Trustee.

 Section 6.7 shall continue for the benefit of the retiring Indenture Trustee.

 communicate with the Indenture Trustee and provide written notices and make written requests and written demands and give written directions to the Indenture Trustee through the procedures of the Clearing Agency and by notice to the Indenture
 Trustee. Any Note Owner must provide a written certification stating that the Note Owner is a beneficial owner of a Note, together with supporting documentation such as a trade confirmation, an account statement, a letter from a broker or dealer
 verifying ownership or another similar document evidencing ownership of a Note. The Indenture Trustee will not be required to take action in response to requests, demands or directions of a Noteholder or a Note Owner, other than to fulfill the

 resolution pursuant to Section 3.4 of the Sale and Servicing Agreement, unless the Noteholder or Note Owner has offered reasonable security or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee to protect it against the costs and expenses
 that it may incur in complying with the request, demand or direction.
(e)
A Noteholder (if the Notes are represented by Definitive Notes) or a Note Owner (if the Notes are represented by Book-Entry Notes) that
 wishes to communicate with other Noteholders or Note Owners, as applicable, about a possible exercise of rights under this Indenture or the other Basic Documents may send a request to the Issuer or the Servicer, on behalf of the Issuer, to include
 information regarding the communication in a Form 10-D to be filed by the Issuer with the Commission. Each request must include (i) the name of the requesting Noteholder or Note Owner, (ii) the method by which other Noteholders or Note Owners, as

 including a trade confirmation, account statement, letter from a broker or dealer or similar document. A Noteholder or Note Owner, as applicable, that delivers a request under this Section 7.2(e) will be deemed to have certified to the Issuer and
 the Servicer that its request to communicate with other Noteholders or Note Owners, as
63
applicable, relates solely to a possible exercise of rights under this Indenture or the other Basic Documents, and will not be used for other purposes.
 The Issuer will promptly deliver any such request to the Servicer. On receipt of a request, the Servicer will include, or will cause the Depositor (at the Servicer’s expense) to include, in the Form 10-D filed by the Issuer with the Commission for
 the Collection Period in which the request was received (A) a statement that the Issuer has received a request from a Noteholder or Note Owner, as applicable, that is interested in communicating with other Noteholders or Note Owners, as applicable,

 Review Receivables under the Asset Representations Review Agreement. In the case of a Note Owner, each written demand must be accompanied by a certification from that Person that it is a Note Owner, together with at least one form of documentation
 evidencing its ownership of a Note, including a trade confirmation, account statement, letter from a broker or dealer or similar document.  If Noteholders and Note Owners, as applicable, of at least 5% of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes
 (excluding the Outstanding Amount of any Notes that are held by the Sponsor or any of its Affiliates) demand a vote within 90 days of the filing of the Form 10-D reporting the occurrence of the Delinquency Trigger, the Indenture Trustee will
 promptly request such a vote of the Noteholders through the Clearing Agency, which vote will remain open until the 150th day after the filing of the related Form 10-D. If (i) a voting quorum of Noteholders holding at least 5% of the aggregate
 principal amount of the Notes (excluding the Outstanding Amount of any Notes that are held by the Sponsor or any of its Affiliates) participate in the related vote and (ii) Noteholders of a majority of the principal amount of Notes (excluding the
 Outstanding Amount of any Notes that are held by the Sponsor or any of its Affiliates) voted agree to an Asset Review, then the Indenture Trustee will send an Asset Review Notice to the Asset Representations Reviewer and the Servicer under the
 Asset Representations Review Agreement directing the Asset Representations Reviewer to conduct the Asset Review.

 security provided by the lien of this Indenture.
The Indenture Trustee may rely on an Opinion of Counsel of external counsel to the Issuer as to whether or not any Notes would be
 affected by any supplemental indenture and any such determination shall be conclusive upon the Holders of all Notes, whether theretofore or thereafter authenticated and delivered hereunder.  The Indenture Trustee’s reasonable costs and expenses

Other than with respect to the release of any Purchased Receivables or Liquidated Receivables, whenever any property or
 securities are to be released from the lien of this Indenture, the Issuer shall also furnish to the Indenture Trustee an Officer’s Certificate certifying or stating the opinion of each person signing such certificate as to the fair value (within 90
 days of such release) of the property or securities proposed to be released and stating that in the opinion of such person the proposed release will not impair the security under this Indenture in contravention of the provisions hereof.
(iv)
Whenever the Issuer is required to furnish to the Indenture Trustee an Officer’s Certificate certifying or stating the
 opinion of any signer thereof as to the matters described in clause (iii) above, the Issuer shall also furnish to the Indenture Trustee an Independent Certificate as to the same matters if the fair value of the property or securities and of all
 other property other than Purchased Receivables and Liquidated Receivables, or securities released from the lien of this Indenture since the commencement of the then current calendar year, as set forth in the certificates required by clause (iii)
 above and this clause (iv), equals 10% or more of the Outstanding Amount of the Notes, but such certificate need not be furnished in the case of any release of property or securities if the fair value thereof as set forth in the related Officer’s
 Certificate is less than $25,000 or less than 1 percent of the then Outstanding Amount of the Notes.
(v)
Notwithstanding Section 2.9 or any other provision of this Section, the Issuer may (or may cause the Holding Trust to)

73
Section 11.2
Form of Documents Delivered to Indenture Trustee
.  In any case where several matters are required to be certified by, or covered by an opinion of, any specified Person,
 it is not necessary that all such matters be certified by, or covered by the opinion of, only one such Person, or that they be so certified or covered by only one document, but one such Person may certify or give an opinion with respect to some
 matters and one or more other such Persons as to other matters, and any such Person may certify or give an opinion as to such matters in one or several documents.
Any certificate or opinion of an Authorized Officer of the Issuer may be based, insofar as it relates to legal matters, upon a
 certificate or opinion of, or representations by, counsel, unless such officer knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know, that the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to the matters upon which his or her certificate
 or opinion is based are erroneous.  Any such certificate of an Authorized Officer or Opinion of Counsel may be based, insofar as it relates to factual matters, upon a certificate or opinion of, or representations by, an officer or officers of the
 Servicer, the Seller or the Issuer, stating that the information with respect to such factual matters is in the possession of the Servicer, the Seller or the Issuer, unless such counsel knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know, that
 the certificate or opinion or representations with respect to such matters are erroneous.
Where any Person is required to make, give or execute two or more applications, requests, consents, certificates, statements, opinions
 or other instruments under this Indenture, they may, but need not, be consolidated and form one instrument.
Whenever in this Indenture, in connection with any application or certificate or report to the Indenture Trustee, it is provided that
 the Issuer shall deliver any document as a condition of the granting of such application, or as evidence of the Issuer’s compliance with any term hereof, it is intended that the truth and accuracy, at the time of the granting of such application or
 at the effective date of such certificate or report (as the case may be), of the facts and opinions stated in such document shall in such case be conditions precedent to the right of the Issuer to have such application granted or to the sufficiency
 of such certificate or report.  The foregoing shall not, however, be construed to affect the Indenture Trustee’s right to rely upon the truth and accuracy of any statement or opinion contained in any such document as provided in Article VI.
Section 11.3
Acts of Noteholders
.
(a)
Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided by this Indenture to be given or taken
 by Noteholders may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such Noteholders in person or by agents duly appointed in writing; and except as herein otherwise expressly provided such action
 shall become effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Indenture Trustee, and, where it is hereby expressly required, to the Issuer.  Such instrument or instruments (and the action embodied therein and evidenced thereby)
 are herein sometimes referred to as the “
Act
” of the Noteholders signing such instrument or instruments.  Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing
 any such agent shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to Section 6.1) conclusive in favor of the Indenture Trustee and the Issuer, if made in the manner provided in this Section.  In the event the Indenture Trustee shall
 receive conflicting or inconsistent requests and indemnity from two or
74
more groups of Noteholders, each representing less than a majority of the Outstanding Amount of the Notes or the Majority Noteholders, the Indenture
 Trustee in its sole discretion may determine what action, if any, shall be taken, notwithstanding any other provisions of this Indenture.
(b)
The fact and date of the execution by any person of any such instrument or writing may be proved in any customary manner of the
 Indenture Trustee.
(c)
The ownership of Notes shall be proved by the Note Register.
(d)
Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action by the Holder of any Notes shall bind the Holder
 of every Note issued upon the registration thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof, in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Indenture Trustee or the Issuer in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such
 action is made upon such Note.
Section 11.4
Notices, etc., to Indenture Trustee, Issuer and Rating Agencies
.  Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or Act of Noteholders or other
 documents provided or permitted by this Indenture to be made upon, given or furnished to or filed with:
(a)
The Indenture Trustee by any Noteholder or by the Issuer shall be sufficient for every purpose hereunder if personally delivered,
 delivered by overnight courier or mailed certified mail, return receipt requested and shall be deemed to have been duly given upon receipt to the Indenture Trustee at its Corporate Trust Office, or
(b)
The Issuer by the Indenture Trustee or by any Noteholder shall be sufficient for every purpose hereunder if personally delivered,
 delivered by overnight courier or mailed certified mail, return receipt requested and shall deemed to have been duly given upon receipt to the Issuer addressed to: Exeter Automobile Receivables Trust 2025-5, in care of Wilmington Trust Company,
 Rodney Square North, 1100 North Market Street, Wilmington, Delaware 19890-0001, Attention: Corporate Trust Administration, with a copy to Exeter Automobile Receivables Trust 2025-5, c/o Exeter Finance LLC, 2101 W. John Carpenter Freeway, Irving,
 Texas 75063, Attention: Chief Financial Officer, and a copy to Exeter Automobile Receivables Trust 2025-5, c/o Exeter Finance LLC, 2101 W. John Carpenter Freeway, Irving, Texas 75063, Attention: Chief Legal Officer, or at any other address
 previously furnished in writing to the Indenture Trustee by Issuer.  The Issuer shall promptly transmit any notice received by it from the Noteholders to the Indenture Trustee.
(c)
Notices required to be given to the Rating Agencies shall be provided by the Issuer in writing, personally delivered, electronically
 delivered, delivered by overnight courier or mailed certified mail, return receipt requested to (i) in the case of Moody’s, to Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., 7 World Trade Center, 250 Greenwich Street, New York, New York 10007, Attention: Asset
 Backed Surveillance or (ii) in the case of S&P, at the following address: S&P Global Ratings, 55 Water Street, New York, New York 10041-0003, Attention: ABS Surveillance Group; or as to each of the foregoing, at such other address as shall
 be designated by written notice to the other parties.
75
Section 11.5
Notices to Noteholders; Waiver
.  Where this Indenture provides for notice to Noteholders of any event, such notice shall be sufficiently given (unless otherwise herein
 expressly provided) if in writing and mailed, first-class, postage prepaid to each Noteholder affected by such event, at his address as it appears on the Note Register, not later than the latest date, and not earlier than the earliest date,
 prescribed for the giving of such notice.  In any case where notice to Noteholders is given by mail, neither the failure to mail such notice nor any defect in any notice so mailed to any particular Noteholder shall affect the sufficiency of such
 notice with respect to other Noteholders, and any notice that is mailed in the manner here in provided shall conclusively be presumed to have been duly given.
Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by any Person entitled to receive such
 notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice.  Waivers of notice by Noteholders shall be filed with the Indenture Trustee but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any
 action taken in reliance upon such a waiver.
In case, by reason of the suspension of regular mail service as a result of a strike, work stoppage or similar activity, it shall be
 impractical to mail notice of any event to Noteholders when such notice is required to be given pursuant to any provision of this Indenture, then any manner of giving such notice as shall be satisfactory to the Indenture Trustee shall be deemed to be
 a sufficient giving of such notice.
Where this Indenture provides for notice to the Rating Agencies, failure to give such notice shall not affect any other rights or
 obligations created hereunder, and shall not under any circumstance constitute a Default or Event of Default.
Section 11.6
Conflict with Trust Indenture Act
.  If any provision hereof limits, qualifies or conflicts with another provision hereof that is required to be included in this
 Indenture by any of the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act, such required provision shall control.
The provisions of TIA §§ 310 through 317 that impose duties on any person (including the provisions automatically deemed included
 herein unless expressly excluded by this Indenture) are a part of and govern this Indenture, whether or not physically contained herein.
Section 11.7
Patriot Act
.  The parties hereto acknowledge that in accordance with the Customer Identification Program (CIP) requirements under the U.S.A. Patriot Act and its
 implementing regulations, the Indenture Trustee, in order to help fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering, is required to obtain, verify, and record information that identifies each person or legal entity that establishes a relationship
 or opens an account with the Indenture Trustee. Each party hereby agrees that it shall provide the Indenture Trustee with such information as the Indenture Trustee may reasonably request that will help the Indenture Trustee to identify and verify
 each party’s identity, including without limitation each party’s name, physical address, tax identification number, organizational documents, certificate of good standing, license to do business, or other pertinent identifying information.
76

 right, remedy or claim under this Indenture.
Section 11.12
Legal Holidays
.  In any case where the date on which any payment is due shall not be a Business Day,
 then (notwithstanding any other provision of the Notes or this Indenture) payment need not be made on such date, but may be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if made on the date on which nominally due, and
 no interest shall accrue for the period from and after any such nominal date.
Section 11.13
GOVERNING LAW AND SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION
.  THIS INDENTURE SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, AND THIS INDENTURE AND ALL MATTERS ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN ANY WAY TO THIS

 no liability with respect to, any faxed, scanned, or photocopied manual signature, or other electronic signature, of any other party and shall have no duty to investigate, confirm or otherwise verify the validity or authenticity thereof. This
 Indenture may be executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but such counterparts shall, together, constitute one and the same instrument.  For the avoidance of doubt, original manual signatures shall be
 used for execution or indorsement of writings and authentication of Notes when required under the UCC or other Signature Law due to the character or intended character of the writings.
Section 11.16

 any such partner, owner or beneficiary shall be fully liable, to the extent provided by applicable law, for any unpaid consideration for stock, unpaid capital contribution or failure to pay any installment or call owing to such entity. For all
 purposes of this Indenture, in the performance of any duties or obligations of the Issuer hereunder, the Owner Trustee shall be subject to, and entitled to the benefits of, the terms and provisions of the Trust Agreement.

The Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes and the Class E Notes (together, the “

Principal of the Class A-3 Notes will be payable on each Distribution Date in an amount described on the face hereof. “

 to Notes registered on the Record Date in the name of the nominee of the Clearing Agency (initially, such nominee to be Cede & Co.), payments will be made by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the account designated by such nominee. 
 Any reduction in the principal amount of this Note (or any one or more Predecessor Notes) effected by any payments made on any Distribution Date shall be binding upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of
 transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or in lieu hereof, whether or not noted hereon.  If funds are expected to be available, as provided in the Indenture, for payment in full of the then remaining unpaid principal amount of this Note on a

 aggregate principal amount will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.  No service charge will be charged for any registration of transfer or exchange of this Note, but the transferor may be required to pay a sum sufficient to cover
 any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any such registration of transfer or exchange.
Each Noteholder or Note Owner, by acceptance of a Note or, in the case of a Note Owner, a beneficial interest in a Note covenants and

 exchange hereof or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.  The Indenture also permits the Indenture Trustee to amend or waive certain terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture without the

 (the “

 hereby made for a statement of the respective rights and obligations thereunder of the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and the Holders of the Notes.  The Notes are subject to all terms of the Indenture.  All terms used in this Note that are defined in

The Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes and the Class E Notes (together, the “
Notes
”) are and will be equally and ratably secured by the collateral pledged as security therefor as provided in the Indenture.
Principal of the Class C Notes will be payable on each Distribution Date in an amount described on the face hereof. “
Distribution Date
” means the fifteenth day of each month, or, if any such date is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day, commencing December 15, 2025.  If Exeter is

Distribution Date

Payments of interest on this Note due and payable on each Distribution Date, together with the installment of principal, if any, to
 the extent not in full payment of this Note, shall be made to the Person whose name appears as the Holder of this Note (or one or more Predecessor Notes) on the Note Register as of the close of business on each Record Date, except that with respect
 to Notes registered on the Record Date in the name of the nominee of the Clearing Agency (initially, such nominee to be Cede & Co.), payments will be made by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the account designated by such nominee. 
 Any reduction in the principal amount of this Note (or any one or more Predecessor Notes) effected by any payments made on any Distribution Date shall be binding upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of
 transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or in lieu hereof, whether or not noted hereon.  If funds are expected to be available, as provided in the Indenture, for payment in full of the then remaining unpaid principal amount of this Note on a
 Distribution Date, then the
C-1-5
Indenture Trustee, in the name of and on behalf of the Issuer, will notify the Person who was the Holder hereof as of the Record Date preceding such
 Distribution Date by notice mailed prior to such Distribution Date and the amount then due and payable shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of this Note at the Indenture Trustee’s principal Corporate Trust Office or at the office of
 the Indenture Trustee’s agent appointed for such purposes located in Jersey City, New Jersey.

 aggregate principal amount will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.  No service charge will be charged for any registration of transfer or exchange of this Note, but the transferor may be required to pay a sum sufficient to cover
 any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any such registration of transfer or exchange.
Each Noteholder or Note Owner, by acceptance of a Note or, in the case of a Note Owner, a beneficial interest in a Note covenants and
 agrees (i) that no recourse may be taken, directly or indirectly, with respect to the obligations of the Issuer, the Holding Trust, the Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee on the Notes or under the Indenture or any certificate or other writing

 beneficiary, agent, officer, director, manager or employee of the Seller, the Servicer, the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity, any holder of a beneficial interest in the Issuer, the Holding Trust, the Seller, the
 Servicer, the Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee or of any successor or assign of the Seller, the Servicer, the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity, except as any such Person may have expressly agreed (it being

 consideration for stock, unpaid capital contribution or failure to pay any installment or call owing to such entity, and (ii) to treat the Notes that are owned or beneficially owned by a Person other than a Certificateholder, or an Affiliate of a
 Certificateholder, as indebtedness for purposes of U.S. federal income, state and local income and franchise and any other income taxes.

 percentages of the Outstanding Amount of the Notes, on behalf of the Holders of all the Notes, to waive compliance by the Issuer with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences.  Any such
 consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note (or any one of more Predecessor Notes) shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in
 exchange hereof or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.  The Indenture also permits the Indenture Trustee to amend or waive certain terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture without the
 consent of Holders of the Notes issued thereunder.

Issuer
” as used in this Note includes any
 successor to the Issuer under the Indenture.

This Note is one of a duly authorized issue of Notes of the Issuer, designated as its Class E [__]% Asset Backed Notes (herein called
 the “
Class E Notes
”), all issued under an Indenture dated as of October 21, 2025 (such indenture, as supplemented or amended, is herein called the “
Indenture
”), among the Issuer, Exeter Holdings Trust 2025-5 (the “
Holding Trust
”) and Citibank, N.A., as indenture trustee
 (the “
Indenture Trustee
,” which term includes any successor Indenture Trustee under the Indenture) to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is
 hereby made for a statement of the respective rights and obligations thereunder of the Issuer, the Indenture Trustee and the Holders of the Notes.  The Notes are subject to all terms of the Indenture.  All terms used in this Note that are defined in
 the Indenture, as supplemented or amended, shall have the meanings assigned to them in or pursuant to the Indenture, as so supplemented or amended.
The Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes and the Class E Notes (together, the “
Notes
”) are and will be equally and ratably secured by the collateral pledged as security therefor as provided in the Indenture.
Principal of the Class E Notes will be payable on each Distribution Date in an amount described on the face hereof. “
Distribution Date
” means the fifteenth day of each month, or, if any such date is not a Business Day, the next succeeding Business Day, commencing December 15, 2025.  If Exeter is

Distribution Date
,” shall be deemed to include the Final Scheduled
 Distribution Date.
As described above, the entire unpaid principal amount of this Note shall be due and payable on the earlier of the Final Scheduled
 Distribution Date and the Redemption Date, if any, pursuant to the Indenture.  As described above, a portion of the unpaid principal balance of this Note shall be due and payable on the Redemption Date, if any.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the

 provided in the Indenture.  All principal payments on the Class E Notes shall be made pro rata to the Class E Noteholders entitled thereto.
Payments of interest on this Note due and payable on each Distribution Date, together with the installment of principal, if any, to
 the extent not in full payment of this Note, shall be made to the Person whose name appears as the Holder of this Note (or one or more Predecessor Notes) on the Note Register as of the close of business on each Record Date, except that with respect
 to Notes registered on the Record Date in the name of the nominee of the Clearing Agency (initially, such nominee to be Cede & Co.), payments will be made by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the account designated by such nominee. 
 Any reduction in the principal amount of this Note (or any one or more Predecessor Notes) effected by any payments made on any Distribution Date shall be binding upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of
 transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or in lieu hereof, whether or not noted hereon.  If funds are expected to be available, as provided in the Indenture, for payment in full of the then remaining unpaid principal amount of this Note on a
 Distribution Date, then the
E-2-8
Indenture Trustee, in the name of and on behalf of the Issuer, will notify the Person who was the Holder hereof as of the Record Date preceding such
 Distribution Date by notice mailed prior to such Distribution Date and the amount then due and payable shall be payable only upon presentation and surrender of this Note at the Indenture Trustee’s principal Corporate Trust Office or at the office of
 the Indenture Trustee’s agent appointed for such purposes located in Jersey City, New Jersey.
The Issuer shall pay interest on overdue installments of interest at the Class E Interest Rate to the extent lawful.

 Note Register upon surrender of this Note for registration of transfer at the office or agency designated by the Issuer pursuant to the Indenture, (i) duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the

 aggregate principal amount will be issued to the designated transferee or transferees.  No service charge will be charged for any registration of transfer or exchange of this Note, but the transferor may be required to pay a sum sufficient to cover
 any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any such registration of transfer or exchange.
Each Noteholder or Note Owner, by acceptance of a Note or, in the case of a Note Owner, a beneficial interest in a Note covenants and
 agrees (i) that no recourse may be taken, directly or indirectly, with respect to the obligations of the Issuer, the Holding Trust, the Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee on the Notes or under the Indenture or any certificate or other writing
 delivered in connection therewith, against (a) the Seller, the Servicer, the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity, (b) any owner of a beneficial interest in the Issuer or the Holding Trust or (c) any partner, owner,
 beneficiary, agent, officer, director, manager or employee of the Seller, the Servicer, the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity, any holder of a beneficial interest in the Issuer, the Holding Trust, the Seller, the
 Servicer, the Owner Trustee or the Indenture Trustee or of any successor or assign of the Seller, the Servicer, the Indenture Trustee or the Owner Trustee in its individual capacity, except as any such Person may have expressly agreed (it being
 understood that the Indenture Trustee and the Owner Trustee have no such obligations in their individual capacity) and except that any such partner, owner or beneficiary shall be fully liable, to the extent provided by applicable law, for any unpaid
 consideration for stock, unpaid capital contribution or failure to pay any installment or call owing to such entity, and (ii) to treat the Notes that are owned or beneficially owned by a Person other than a Certificateholder, or an Affiliate of a
 Certificateholder, as indebtedness for purposes of U.S. federal income, state and local income and franchise and any other income taxes.

 Issuer or the Indenture Trustee may treat the Person in

 obligations of the Issuer and the rights of the Holders of the Notes under the Indenture at any time by the Issuer with the consent of the Majority Noteholders.  The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Noteholders representing specified
 percentages of the Outstanding Amount of the Notes, on behalf of the Holders of all the Notes, to waive compliance by the Issuer with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences.  Any such
 consent or waiver by the Holder of this Note (or any one of more Predecessor Notes) shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in
 exchange hereof or in lieu hereof whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Note.  The Indenture also permits the Indenture Trustee to amend or waive certain terms and conditions set forth in the Indenture without the
 consent of Holders of the Notes issued thereunder.
The term “
Issuer
” as used in this Note includes any
 successor to the Issuer under the Indenture.

The Class A Notes, the Class B Notes, the Class C Notes, the Class D Notes and the Class E Notes (together, the “

 Any reduction in the principal amount of this Note (or any one or more Predecessor Notes) effected by any payments made on any Distribution Date shall be binding upon all future Holders of this Note and of any Note issued upon the registration of
 transfer hereof or in exchange hereof or in lieu hereof, whether or not noted hereon.  If funds are expected to be available, as provided in the Indenture, for payment in full of the then remaining unpaid principal amount of this Note on a
 Distribution Date, then the
