NOW, THEREFORE
, in
consideration of the mutual agreements herein contained, the parties hereto agree as follows:
1.
Appointment of Warrant Agent
. The Company hereby appoints
the Warrant Agent to act as agent for the Company for the Warrants, and the Warrant Agent hereby accepts such appointment and agrees
to perform the same in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.
2.
Warrants
.
2.1
Form of Warrant
. Each Warrant shall be issued in registered
form only, and, if a physical certificate is issued, shall be in substantially the form of
Exhibit B
hereto, the provisions of
which are incorporated herein and shall be signed by, or bear the facsimile signature of, the Chairperson of the Company’s board
of directors (the “
Board
”), President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Secretary or other
principal officer of the Company. In the event the person whose facsimile signature has been placed upon any Warrant shall have ceased
to serve in the capacity in which such person signed the Warrant before such Warrant is issued, it may be issued with the same effect
as if he or she had not ceased to be such at the date of issuance. All of the Public Warrants shall initially be represented by one or
more book-entry certificates (each, a “
Book-Entry Warrant Certificate
”).
2.2
Effect of Countersignature
. If a physical certificate
is issued, unless and until countersigned by the Warrant Agent pursuant to this Agreement, a Warrant certificate shall be invalid and
of no effect and may not be exercised by the holder thereof.
2.3
Registration
.
2.3.1
Warrant Register
. The Warrant Agent shall maintain books
(the “
Warrant Register
”) for the registration of original issuance and the registration of transfer of the
Warrants. Upon the initial issuance of the Warrants, the Warrant Agent shall issue and register the Warrants in the names of the respective
holders thereof in such denominations and otherwise in accordance with instructions delivered to the Warrant Agent by the Company. All
of the Public Warrants shall initially be represented by one or more Book-Entry Warrant Certificates deposited with The Depository Trust
Company (the “
Depositary
”) and registered in the name of Cede & Co., a nominee of the Depositary. Ownership
of beneficial interests in the Public Warrants shall be shown on, and the transfer of such ownership shall be effected through, records
maintained by (i) the Depositary or its nominee for each Book-Entry Warrant Certificate, or (ii) institutions that have accounts with
the Depositary (each such institution, with respect to a Warrant in its account, a “
Participant
”).
If the Depositary subsequently ceases
to make its book-entry settlement system available for the Public Warrants, the Company may instruct the Warrant Agent regarding making
other arrangements for book-entry settlement. In the event that the Public Warrants are not eligible for, or it is no longer necessary
to have the Public Warrants available in, book-entry form, the Warrant Agent shall provide written instructions to the Depositary to deliver
to the Warrant Agent for cancellation each Book-Entry Warrant Certificate, and the Company shall instruct the Warrant Agent to deliver
to the Depositary definitive certificates in physical form evidencing such Warrants (“
Definitive Warrant Certificate
”).
Such Definitive Warrant Certificate shall be in the form annexed hereto as
Exhibit B
, with appropriate insertions, modifications
and omissions, as provided above.
2.3.2
Registered Holder
. Prior to due presentment for registration
of transfer of any Warrant, the Company and the Warrant Agent may deem and treat the person in whose name such Warrant is registered
in the Warrant Register (the “
Registered Holder
”) as the absolute owner of such Warrant and of each Warrant
represented thereby (notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing on a Definitive Warrant Certificate made by anyone other
than the Company or the Warrant Agent), for the purpose of any exercise thereof, and for all other purposes, and neither the Company
nor the Warrant Agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.

2.4
Detachability of Warrants
. The Class A Shares and Public
Warrants comprising the Units shall begin separate trading on the 52nd day following the date of the Prospectus or, if such 52nd day
is not on a day, other than a Saturday, Sunday or federal holiday, on which banks in New York City are generally open for normal business
(a “
Business Day
”), then on the immediately succeeding Business Day following such date, or earlier (the “
Detachment
Date
”) with the consent of Clear Street, LLC, as representative of the several underwriters, but in no event shall the
Class A Shares and the Public Warrants comprising the Units be separately traded until the Company issues a press release and files with
the Commission a Current Report on Form 8-K announcing when such separate trading shall begin. Holders of Warrants shall contact the
Transfer Agent in order to effect such separation.
2.5
No Fractional Warrants Other Than as Part of Units
. The
Company shall not issue fractional Warrants other than as part of the Units, each of which is comprised of one Class A Share and one-third
of one Public Warrant. If, upon the detachment of Public Warrants from the Units or otherwise, a holder of Warrants would be entitled
to receive a fractional Warrant, the Company shall round down to the nearest whole number the number of Warrants to be issued to such
holder.
2.6
Private Placement Warrants and Working Capital Warrants
.
The Private Placement Warrants and Working Capital Warrants shall be identical to the Public Warrants, except that until the date that
is thirty (30) days after the completion by the Company of an initial Business Combination the Private Placement Warrants and the Working
Capital Warrants may not be transferred, assigned or sold by the holders thereof, other than:
2.6.1
to the Company’s officers or directors, any affiliate or family member of any of the Company’s
officers or directors, any members or partners of the Sponsor or their affiliates, any affiliates of the Sponsor, or any employees of
such affiliates;

2.6.3
in the case of an individual, by virtue of the laws of descent and distribution upon death of such person;
2.6.4
in the case of an individual, pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order;
2.6.5
by private sales or transfers made in connection with any forward purchase agreement or similar arrangement,
in connection with an extension of the timeframe for the Company to consummate a Business Combination or in connection with the consummation
of an initial Business Combination at prices no greater than the price at which the Warrants were originally purchased;
2.6.6
by pro rata distributions from the Sponsor to its respective members, partners or stockholders pursuant
to the Sponsor’s limited liability company agreement or other charter documents;
2.6.7
by virtue of the laws of the Cayman Islands or the limited liability company agreement of the Sponsor
upon dissolution of the Sponsor;
2.6.8
in the event of the Company’s liquidation prior to the consummation of a Business Combination;
2.6.9
to a nominee or custodian of a person or entity to whom a disposition or transfer would be permissible
under
subsections 2.6.1
through
2.6.7
above;
2.6.10
to the Company for no value for cancellation in connection with the consummation of an initial Business
Combination; and
2.6.11
in the event that, subsequent to the consummation of an initial Business Combination, the Company completes
a liquidation, merger, share exchange or other similar transaction which results in all of its shareholders having the right to exchange
their Class A Shares for cash, securities or other property;
provided
,
however
, that, in the case of
subsections 2.6.1
through
2.6.7
, and
2.6.9
these transferees (the “
Permitted Transferees
”) enter into a written
agreement with the Company agreeing to be bound by the transfer restrictions in this Agreement and the other restrictions contained in
the letter agreement, dated as of the date hereof, by and among the Company, the Sponsor, and the Company’s officers and directors.

3.1
Warrant Price
. Each Warrant shall entitle the Registered
Holder thereof, subject to the provisions of such Warrant and of this Agreement, including without limitation,

,
to purchase from the Company the number of Class A Shares stated therein, at the price of $11.50 per share, subject to the adjustments
provided in
Section 4
hereof and in the last sentence of this
Section 3.1
. The term “
Warrant Price
”
as used in this Agreement shall mean the price per share (including in cash or by payment of Warrants pursuant to a “cashless exercise,”
to the extent permitted hereunder) described in the prior sentence at which the Class A Shares may be purchased at the time a Warrant
is exercised. The Company in its sole discretion may lower the Warrant Price at any time prior to the Expiration Date (as defined below)
for a period of not less than twenty (20) Business Days (unless otherwise required by the Commission, any national securities exchange
on which the Warrants are listed or applicable law),
provided
, that the Company shall provide at least three (3) days’ prior
written notice of such reduction to Registered Holders of the Warrants and,
provided further
that any such reduction shall be
identical among all of the Warrants.
3.2
Duration of Warrants
. A Warrant may be exercised only
during the period (the “
Exercise Period
”) (A) commencing on the date that is thirty (30) days after the first
date on which the Company completes a Business Combination, and terminating on the earliest to occur of: (x) 5:00 p.m., New York City
time on the date that is five (5) years after the date on which the Company completes its initial Business Combination, (y) the liquidation
of the Company, and (z) with respect to a redemption pursuant to
Section 6.1
hereof, 5:00 p.m., New York City time on the Redemption
Date (as defined below) as provided in
Section 6.2
hereof (the “
Expiration Date

provided
,
however
, that the exercise of any Warrant shall be subject to the satisfaction of any applicable conditions, as set forth in
subsection

below, with respect to an effective registration statement or a valid exemption therefrom being available. Each outstanding
Warrant not exercised on or before the Expiration Date shall become void, and all rights thereunder and all rights in respect thereof
under this Agreement shall cease at 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the Expiration Date. The Company in its sole discretion may extend
the duration of the Warrants by delaying the Expiration Date;
provided
, that the Company shall provide at least twenty (20) days
prior written notice of any such extension to Registered Holders of the Warrants and,
provided further
that any such extension
shall be identical in duration among all the Warrants.
3.3
Exercise of Warrants
.
3.3.1
Payment
. Subject to the provisions of the Warrant and
this Agreement, including without limitation,
subsection 3.3.5
, a Warrant may be exercised by the Registered Holder thereof by
delivering to the Warrant Agent at its corporate trust department (i) the Definitive Warrant Certificate evidencing the Warrants to be
exercised, or, in the case of a Book-Entry Warrant Certificate, the Warrants to be exercised (the “
Book-Entry Warrants
”)
on the records of the Depositary to an account of the Warrant Agent at the Depositary designated for such purposes in writing by the
Warrant Agent to the Depositary from time to time, (ii) an election to purchase (“
Election to Purchase
”) Class
A Shares pursuant to the exercise of a Warrant, properly completed and executed by the Registered Holder on the reverse of the Definitive
Warrant Certificate or, in the case of a Book-Entry Warrant Certificate, properly delivered by the Participant in accordance with the
Depositary’s procedures, and (iii) payment in full of the Warrant Price for each Class A Share as to which the Warrant is exercised
and any and all applicable taxes due in connection with the exercise of the Warrant, the exchange of the Warrant for the Class A Shares
and the issuance of such Class A Shares, as follows:
(a)
in lawful money of the United States, in good bank draft or good certified check payable to the order
of the Warrant Agent or by wire transfer of immediately available funds;
-
4
-
(b)
in the event of a redemption pursuant to
Section 6
hereof in which the Company’s board of
directors (the “
Board
”) has elected to require all holders of the Warrants to exercise such Warrants on a “cashless
basis,” by surrendering the Warrants for that number of Class A Shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the product
of the number of Class A Shares underlying the Warrants, multiplied by the excess of the “Fair Market Value”, as defined in
this
subsection 3.3.1(b)
, over the Warrant Price by (y) the Fair Market Value. Solely for purposes of this
subsection 3.3.1(b)
and
Section 6.3
, the “
Fair Market Value
” shall mean the average reported closing price of the Class A
Shares for the ten (10) trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the
holders of the Warrants, pursuant to
Section 6
hereof; or
(c)
on a cashless basis as provided in
Section 7.4
hereof.
3.3.2
Issuance of Class A Shares on Exercise
. As soon as practicable
after the exercise of any Warrant and the clearance of the funds in payment of the Warrant Price (if payment is pursuant to
subsection
3.3.1(a)
), the Company shall issue to the Registered Holder of such Warrant a book-entry position or certificate, as applicable,
for the number of Class A Shares to which he, she or it is entitled, registered in such name or names as may be directed by him, her
or it, and if such Warrant shall not have been exercised in full, a new book-entry position or countersigned Warrant, as applicable,
for the number of Class A Shares as to which such Warrant shall not have been exercised. If fewer than all the Warrants evidenced by
a Book-Entry Warrant Certificate are exercised, a notation shall be made to the records maintained by the Depositary, its nominee for
each Book-Entry Warrant Certificate, or a Participant, as appropriate, evidencing the balance of the Warrants remaining after such exercise.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated to deliver any Class A Shares pursuant to the exercise of a Warrant
and shall have no obligation to settle such Warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to
the Class A Shares underlying the Public Warrants is then effective and a prospectus relating thereto is current, subject to the Company’s
satisfying its obligations under
Section 7.4
or a valid exemption from registration is available. No Warrant shall be exercisable
and the Company shall not be obligated to issue Class A Shares upon exercise of a Warrant unless the Class A Shares issuable upon such
Warrant exercise have been registered, qualified or deemed to be exempt from registration or qualification under the securities laws
of the state of residence of the Registered Holder of the Warrants. In the event that the conditions in the two immediately preceding
sentences are not satisfied with respect to a Warrant, the holder of such Warrant shall not be entitled to exercise such Warrant. In
no event will the Company be required to net cash settle the Warrant exercise. The Company may require holders of Public Warrants to
settle the Warrant on a “cashless basis” pursuant to
Section 7.4
. If, by reason of any exercise of Warrants on a “cashless
basis,” the holder of any Warrant would be entitled, upon the exercise of such Warrant, to receive a fractional interest in a Class
A Share, the Company shall round down to the nearest whole number, the number of Class A Shares to be issued to such holder.
3.3.3
Valid Issuance
. All Class A Shares issued upon the proper
exercise of a Warrant in conformity with this Agreement shall be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.
3.3.4
Date of Issuance
. Each person in whose name any book-entry
position or certificate, as applicable, for Class A Shares is issued shall for all purposes be deemed to have become the holder of record
of such Class A Shares on the date on which the Warrant, or book-entry position representing such Warrant, was surrendered and payment
of the Warrant Price was made, irrespective of the date of delivery of such certificate in the case of a certificated Warrant, except
that, if the date of such surrender and payment is a date when the share transfer books of the Company or book-entry system of the Warrant
Agent are closed, such person shall be deemed to have become the holder of such Class A Shares at the close of business on the next succeeding
date on which the share transfer books or book-entry system are open.

-
3.3.5
Maximum Percentage
. A holder of a Warrant may notify
the Company in writing in the event it elects to be subject to the provisions contained in this
subsection 3.3.5
; however, no
holder of a Warrant shall be subject to this
subsection 3.3.5
unless he, she or it makes such election. If the election is made
by a holder, the Warrant Agent shall not effect the exercise of the holder’s Warrant, and such holder shall not have the right
to exercise such Warrant, to the extent that after giving effect to such exercise, such person (together with such person’s affiliates)
or any “group” of which the holder or its affiliate is a member, would beneficially own in excess of 4.9% or 9.8% (or such
other amount as a holder may specify) (the “
Maximum Percentage
”) of the Class A Shares outstanding immediately
after giving effect to such exercise. For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the aggregate number of Class A Shares beneficially owned
by such person and its affiliates, or any group of which such person and its affiliates is a member, shall include the number of Class
A Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrant with respect to which the determination of such sentence is being made, but shall exclude
Class A Shares that would be issuable upon (x) exercise of the remaining, unexercised portion of the Warrant beneficially owned by such
person and its affiliates, or any group of which any such person or its affiliates is a member, and (y) exercise or conversion of the
unexercised or unconverted portion of any other securities of the Company beneficially owned by such person and its affiliates, or any
group of which such person or its affiliates is a member (including, without limitation, any convertible notes or convertible preferred
shares or warrants) subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained herein. Except as set forth
in the preceding sentence, for purposes of this paragraph, beneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “
Exchange Act
”), and the applicable regulations of
the Commission. For purposes hereof, “group” has the meaning set forth in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and applicable
regulations of the Commission, and the percentage held by the holder shall be determined in a manner consistent with the provisions of
Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act. To the extent that a holder makes the election described in this
subsection 3.3.5
, the Warrant
Agent shall not effect the exercise of the holder’s Warrant, and such holder shall not have the right to exercise such Warrant
unless it provides to the Warrant Agent in its Election to Purchase, a certification that, upon after giving effect to such exercise,
such person (together with such person’s affiliates) or any “group” of which such holder or its affiliates is a member,
would not beneficially own in excess of the Maximum Percentage of the Class A Shares outstanding immediately after giving effect to such
exercise as determined in accordance with this
subsection 3.3.5
. For purposes of the Warrant, in determining the number of outstanding
Class A Shares, the holder may rely on the number of outstanding Class A Shares as reflected in (1) the Company’s most recent Annual
Report on Form 10-K, Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, Current Report on Form 8-K or other public filing with the Commission as the case
may be, (2) a more recent public announcement by the Company or (3) any other notice by the Company or the Transfer Agent setting forth
the number of Class A Shares outstanding. For any reason at any time, upon the written request of the holder of the Warrant, the Company
shall, within two (2) Business Days, confirm orally and in writing to such holder the number of Class A Shares then outstanding. In any
case, the number of outstanding Class A Shares shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of equity securities
of the Company by the holder and its affiliates since the date as of which such number of outstanding Class A Shares was reported. By
written notice to the Company, the holder of a Warrant may from time to time increase or decrease the Maximum Percentage applicable to
such holder to any other percentage specified in such notice;
provided
,
however
, that any such increase shall not be effective
until the sixty-first (61st) day after such notice is delivered to the Company.
4.
Adjustments
.
4.1
Share Capitalizations
.
4.1.1
Sub-division
. If after the date hereof, and subject to
the provisions of
Section 4.6
below, the number of outstanding Class A Shares is increased by a share capitalization payable in
Class A Shares, or by a sub-division of Class A Shares or other similar event, then, on the effective date of such share capitalization,
sub-division or similar event, the number of Class A Shares issuable on exercise of each Warrant shall be increased in proportion to
such increase in the outstanding Class A Shares. A rights offering made to all or substantially all holders of the Class A Shares entitling
holders to purchase Class A Shares at a price less than the “Historical Fair Market Value” (as defined below) shall be deemed
a share capitalization of a number of Class A Shares equal to the product of (i) the number of Class A Shares actually sold in such rights
offering (or issuable under any other equity securities sold in such rights offering that are convertible into or exercisable for Class
A Shares) and (ii) one (1) minus the quotient of (x) the price per Class A Share paid in such rights offering divided by (y) the Historical
Fair Market Value. For purposes of this
subsection 4.1.1
, (i) if the rights offering is for securities convertible into or exercisable
for Class A Shares, in determining the price payable for Class A Shares, there shall be taken into account any consideration received
for such rights, as well as any additional amount payable upon exercise or conversion and (ii) “
Historical Fair Market Value
”
means the volume weighted average price of the Class A Shares as reported during the ten (10) trading day period ending on the trading
day prior to the first date on which the Class A Shares trade on the applicable exchange or in the applicable market, regular way, without
the right to receive such rights. No Class A Shares shall be issued at less than their par value.
-

-
4.1.2
Extraordinary Dividends
. If the Company, at any time
while the Warrants are outstanding and unexpired, shall pay a dividend or make a distribution in cash, securities or other assets to
all or substantially all of the holders of Class A Shares on account of such Class A Shares (or other shares of the Company’s share
capital into which the Warrants are convertible), other than (a) as described in
subsection 4.1.1
above, (b) Ordinary Cash Dividends
(as defined below), (c) to satisfy the redemption rights of the holders of Class A Shares in connection with a proposed initial Business
Combination, (d) to satisfy the redemption rights of the holders of Class A Shares in connection with a shareholder vote to amend the
Company’s amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (as amended from time to time, the “
Charter
”)
(A) to modify the substance or timing of the Company’s obligation to allow redemption in connection with the Company’s initial
business combination or to redeem 100% of the Class A Shares included in the Units sold in the Offering (the “
Public Shares
”)
if the Company does not complete the Business Combination within the period set forth in the Charter or (B) with respect to any other
material provisions relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-initial Business Combination activity or (e) in connection with the
redemption of Public Shares upon the failure of the Company to complete its initial Business Combination and any subsequent distribution
of its assets upon its liquidation (any such non-excluded event being referred to herein as an “
Extraordinary Dividend
”),
then the Warrant Price shall be decreased, effective immediately after the effective date of such Extraordinary Dividend, by the amount
of cash and/or the fair market value (as determined by the Board, in good faith) of any securities or other assets paid on each Class
A Share in respect of such Extraordinary Dividend. For purposes of this
subsection 4.1.2
, “
Ordinary Cash Dividends
”
means any cash dividend or cash distribution which, when combined on a per share basis, with the per share amounts of all other cash
dividends and cash distributions paid on the Class A Shares during the 365-day period ending on the date of declaration of such dividend
or distribution (as adjusted to appropriately reflect any of the events referred to in other subsections of this
Section 4
and
excluding cash dividends or cash distributions that resulted in an adjustment to the Warrant Price or to the number of Class A Shares
issuable on exercise of each Warrant) does not exceed $0.50 (being 5% of the offering price of the Units in the Offering) but only with
respect to the amount of the aggregate cash dividends or cash distributions equal to or less than $0.50. Solely for purposes of illustration,
if the Company, at a time while the Warrants are outstanding and unexpired, pays a cash dividend of $0.35 and previously paid an aggregate
of $0.40 of cash dividends and cash distributions on the Class A Shares during the 365-day period ending on the date of declaration of
such $0.35 dividend, then the Warrant Price will be decreased, effectively immediately after the effective date of such $0.35 dividend,
by $0.25 (the absolute value of the difference between $0.75 (the aggregate amount of all cash dividends and cash distributions paid
or made in such 365-day period, including such $0.35 dividend) and $0.50 (the greater of (x) $0.50 and (y) the aggregate amount of all
cash dividends and cash distributions paid or made in such 365-day period prior to such $0.35 dividend)).
4.2
Aggregation of Shares
. If after the date hereof, and
subject to the provisions of
Section 4.6
hereof, the number of outstanding Class A Shares is decreased by a consolidation, combination,
reverse share sub-division or reclassification of Class A Shares or other similar event, then, on the effective date of such consolidation,
combination, reverse share sub-division, reclassification or similar event, the number of Class A Shares issuable on exercise of each
Warrant shall be decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding Class A Shares.

4.3
Adjustments in Warrant Price
.
4.3.1
Whenever the number of Class A Shares purchasable upon the exercise of the Warrants is adjusted, as provided
in
subsection 4.1.1
or
Section 4.2
above, the Warrant Price shall be adjusted (to the nearest cent) by multiplying such
Warrant Price immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction (x) the numerator of which shall be the number of Class A Shares purchasable
upon the exercise of the Warrants immediately prior to such adjustment, and (y) the denominator of which shall be the number of Class
A Shares so purchasable immediately thereafter.
4.3.2
If (x) the Company issues additional Class A Shares or equity-linked securities for capital raising purposes
in connection with the closing of the initial Business Combination at an issue price or effective issue price of less than $9.20 per Class
A Share (with such issue price or effective issue price to be determined in good faith by the Board and, in the case of any such issuance
to the initial shareholders (as defined in the Prospectus) or their affiliates, without taking into account any Class B Ordinary Shares
(as defined below) held by such shareholders or their affiliates, as applicable, prior to such issuance (the “
Newly Issued
Price
”)), (y) the aggregate gross proceeds from such issuances represent more than 60% of the total equity proceeds, and
interest thereon, available for funding the initial Business Combination on the date of the consummation of the initial Business Combination
(net of redemptions), and (z) the volume weighted average trading price of the Class A Shares during the 20 trading day period starting
on the trading day prior to the day on which the Company consummates the Business Combination (such price, the “
Market Value
”)
is below $9.20 per share, the Warrant Price shall be adjusted (to the nearest cent) to be equal to 115% of the higher of the Market Value
and the Newly Issued Price, the $18.00 per share redemption trigger price described in
Section 6.1
below shall be adjusted (to
the nearest cent) to be equal to 180% of the higher of the Market Value and the Newly Issued Price.
4.4
Replacement of Securities upon Reorganization, etc.
In case of any reclassification or reorganization of the outstanding Class A Shares (other than a change covered by
subsections 4.1.1
,
4.1.2
or
Section 4.2
hereof or that solely affects the par value of such Class A Shares), or in the case of any merger
or consolidation of the Company with or into another entity or conversion of the Company as another entity (other than a consolidation
or merger in which the Company is the continuing corporation and is not a subsidiary of another entity whose shareholders did not own
all or substantially all of the Class A Shares of the Company in substantially the same proportions immediately before such transaction
and that does not result in any reclassification or reorganization of the outstanding Class A Shares), or in the case of any sale or
conveyance to another entity of the assets or other property of the Company as an entirety or substantially as an entirety in connection
with which the Company is dissolved, the holders of the Warrants shall thereafter have the right to purchase and receive, upon the basis
and upon the terms and conditions specified in the Warrants and in lieu of the Class A Shares of the Company immediately theretofore
purchasable and receivable upon the exercise of the rights represented thereby, the kind and amount of shares or other securities or
property (including cash) receivable upon such reclassification, reorganization, merger or consolidation, or upon a dissolution following
any such sale or transfer, that the holder of the Warrants would have received if such holder had exercised his, her or its Warrant(s)
immediately prior to such event (the “
Alternative Issuance
”);
provided
,
however
, that (i) if
the holders of the Class A Shares were entitled to exercise a right of election as to the kind or amount of securities, cash or other
assets receivable upon such consolidation or merger, then the kind and amount of securities, cash or other assets constituting the Alternative
Issuance for which each Warrant shall become exercisable shall be deemed to be the weighted average of the kind and amount received per
share by the holders of the Class A Shares in such consolidation or merger that affirmatively make such election, and (ii) if a tender,
exchange or redemption offer shall have been made to and accepted by the holders of the Class A Shares (other than a tender, exchange
or redemption offer made by the Company in connection with redemption rights held by shareholders of the Company as provided for in the
Charter or as a result of the redemption of Class A Shares by the Company if a proposed initial Business Combination is presented to
the shareholders of the Company for approval) under circumstances in which, upon completion of such tender or exchange offer, the maker
thereof, together with members of any group (within the meaning of Rule 13d-5(b)(1) under the Exchange Act (or any successor rule)) of
which such maker is a part, and together with any affiliate or associate of such maker (within the meaning of Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange
Act (or any successor rule)) and any members of any such group of which any such affiliate or associate is a part, own beneficially (within
the meaning of Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act (or any successor rule)) more than 65% of the voting power of the Company’s outstanding
equity securities (including with respect to the election of directors), the holder of a Warrant shall be entitled to receive as the
Alternative Issuance, the weighted average of the amount of cash, securities or other property to which such holder would actually have
been entitled as a shareholder if such Warrant holder had exercised the Warrant prior to the expiration of such tender or exchange offer,
accepted such offer and participated in such tender or exchange offer on a pro rata basis with all other holders of Class A Shares, subject
to adjustments (from and after the consummation of such tender or exchange offer) as nearly equivalent as possible to the adjustments
provided for in this
Section 4
. If any reclassification or reorganization also results in a change in Class A Shares covered by
subsection 4.1.1
, then such adjustment shall be made pursuant to
subsection 4.1.1
or
Sections 4.2
,
4.3
and
this
Section 4.4
. The provisions of this
Section 4.4
shall similarly apply to successive reclassifications, reorganizations,
mergers or consolidations, sales or other transfers. In no event will the Warrant Price be reduced to less than the par value per share
issuable upon exercise of the Warrant.
-

-
4.5
Notices of Changes in Warrant
. Upon every adjustment
of the Warrant Price or the number of Class A Shares issuable upon exercise of a Warrant, the Company shall give written notice thereof
to the Warrant Agent, which notice shall state the Warrant Price resulting from such adjustment and the increase or decrease, if any,
in the number of Class A Shares purchasable at such price upon the exercise of a Warrant, setting forth in reasonable detail the method
of calculation and the facts upon which such calculation is based. Upon the occurrence of any event specified in
Sections 4.1
,
4.2
,
4.3
or
4.4
, the Company shall give written notice of the occurrence of such event to each holder of a Warrant,
at the last address set forth for such holder in the Warrant Register, of the record date or the effective date of the event. Failure
to give such notice, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of such event.
4.6
No Fractional Shares
. Notwithstanding any provision contained
in this Agreement to the contrary, the Company shall not issue fractional Class A Shares upon the exercise of Warrants. If, by reason
of any adjustment made pursuant to this
Section 4
, the holder of any Warrant would be entitled, upon the exercise of such Warrant,
to receive a fractional interest in a share, the Company shall, upon such exercise, round down to the nearest whole number the number
of Class A Shares to be issued to such holder.
4.7
Form of Warrant
. The form of Warrant need not be changed
because of any adjustment pursuant to this
Section 4
, and Warrants issued after such adjustment may state the same Warrant Price
and the same number of Class A Shares as is stated in the Warrants initially issued pursuant to this Agreement;
provided
,
however
,
that the Company may at any time in its sole discretion make any change in the form of Warrant that the Company may deem appropriate
and that does not affect the substance thereof, and any Warrant thereafter issued or countersigned, whether in exchange or substitution
for an outstanding Warrant or otherwise, may be in the form as so changed.
4.8
Other Events
. In case any event shall occur affecting
the Company as to which none of the provisions of the preceding subsections of this
Section 4
are strictly applicable, but which
would require an adjustment to the terms of the Warrants in order to (i) avoid an adverse impact on the Warrants and (ii) effectuate
the intent and purpose of this
Section 4
, then, in each such case, the Company shall appoint a firm of independent public accountants,
investment banking or other appraisal firm of recognized national standing, which shall give its opinion as to whether or not any adjustment
to the rights represented by the Warrants is necessary to effectuate the intent and purpose of this
Section 4
and, if they determine
that an adjustment is necessary, the terms of such adjustment. The Company shall adjust the terms of the Warrants in a manner that is
consistent with any adjustment recommended in such opinion. For the avoidance of doubt, all adjustments made pursuant to this
Section
4.8
shall be made equally to all outstanding Warrants.
4.9
No Adjustment
. For the avoidance of doubt, no adjustment
shall be made to the terms of the Warrants solely as a result of an adjustment to the conversion ratio of the Company’s Class B
ordinary shares (the “
Class B Ordinary Shares
”) into Class A Shares or the conversion of the Class B Ordinary
Shares into Class A Shares, in each case, pursuant to the Charter.

5.
Transfer and Exchange of Warrants
.
5.1
Registration of Transfer
. The Warrant Agent shall register
the transfer, from time to time, of any outstanding Warrant upon the Warrant Register, upon surrender of such Warrant for transfer, in
the case of a certificated Warrant, properly endorsed with signatures properly guaranteed and accompanied by appropriate instructions
for transfer. Upon any such transfer, a new Warrant representing an equal aggregate number of Warrants shall be issued and the old Warrant
shall be cancelled by the Warrant Agent. In the case of certificated Warrants, the Warrants so cancelled shall be delivered by the Warrant
Agent to the Company from time to time upon request.
5.2
Procedure for Surrender of Warrants
. Warrants may be
surrendered to the Warrant Agent, together with a written request for exchange or transfer, and thereupon the Warrant Agent shall issue
in exchange therefor one or more new Warrants as requested by the Registered Holder of the Warrants so surrendered, representing an equal
aggregate number of Warrants;
provided
,
however
, that except as otherwise provided herein or in any Book-Entry Warrant
Certificate or Definitive Warrant Certificate, each Book-Entry Warrant Certificate and Definitive Warrant Certificate may be transferred
only in whole and only to the Depositary, to another nominee of the Depositary, to a successor depository, or to a nominee of a successor
depository;
provided further
,
however
, that in the event that a Warrant surrendered for transfer bears a restrictive legend
(as in the case of the Private Placement Warrants and the Working Capital Warrants), the Warrant Agent shall not cancel such Warrant
and issue new Warrants in exchange thereof until the Warrant Agent has received an opinion of counsel for the Company stating that such
transfer may be made and indicating whether the new Warrants must also bear a restrictive legend.
5.3
Fractional Warrants
. The Warrant Agent shall not be required
to effect any registration of transfer or exchange which shall result in the issuance of a warrant certificate or book-entry position
for a fraction of a warrant, except as part of the Units.
5.4
Service Charges
. No service charge shall be made for
any exchange or registration of transfer of Warrants.
5.5
Warrant Execution and Countersignature
. The Warrant
Agent is hereby authorized to countersign and to deliver, in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the Warrants required to be
issued pursuant to the provisions of this
Section 5
, and the Company, whenever required by the Warrant Agent, shall supply the
Warrant Agent with Warrants duly executed on behalf of the Company for such purpose.
5.6
Transfer of Warrants
. Prior to the Detachment Date,
the Public Warrants may be transferred or exchanged only together with the Unit in which such Warrant is included, and only for the purpose
of effecting, or in conjunction with, a transfer or exchange of such Unit. Furthermore, each transfer of a Unit on the register relating
to such Units shall operate also to transfer the Warrants included in such Unit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this
Section 5.6
shall have no effect on any transfer of Warrants on and after the Detachment Date.
6.
Redemption
.
6.1
Redemption of Warrants for Cash
. All, but not less
than all, of the outstanding Warrants may be redeemed (in whole and not in part), at the option of the Company, at any time during the
Exercise Period, at the office of the Warrant Agent, upon notice to the Registered Holders of the Warrants, as described in
Section
6.2
below, at a Redemption Price (as defined below) of $0.01 per Warrant;
provided
that (a) the Reference Value equals or
exceeds $18.00 per share (subject to adjustment in compliance with
Section 4
hereof) and (b) there is an effective registration
statement covering the Class A Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants, and a current prospectus relating thereto, available throughout
the Measurement Period and the 30-day Redemption Period (each as defined in
Section 6.2
below).

-
6.2
Date Fixed for, and Notice of, Redemption; Redemption
Price; Reference Value
. In the event that the Company elects to redeem the Warrants pursuant to
Section 6.1
, the Company shall
fix a date for the redemption (the “
Redemption Dat
e
”). Notice of redemption shall be mailed by first
class mail, postage prepaid, by the Company not less than thirty (30) days prior to the Redemption Date (such period, the “
Redemption
Period
”) to the Registered Holders of the Warrants to be redeemed at their last addresses as they shall appear on the registration
books. Any notice mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given whether or not the Registered
Holder received such notice. As used in this Agreement, (a) “
Redemption Price
” shall mean the price per Warrant
at which any Warrants are redeemed pursuant to
Sections 6.1
and (b) “
Reference Value
” shall mean the
last reported sales price of the Class A Shares for any twenty (20) trading days within the thirty (30) trading-day period commencing
at least 30 days after the completion of the initial Business Combination and ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which
notice of the redemption is given (the “
Measurement Period
”).
6.3
Exercise After Notice of Redemption
. The Warrants
may be exercised, for cash (or on a “cashless basis” in accordance with
Section 3
of this Agreement) at any time after
notice of redemption shall have been given by the Company pursuant to
Section 6.2
hereof and prior to the Redemption Date. In
the event the Company determines to require all holders of Warrants to exercise their Warrants on a “cashless basis” pursuant
to
subsection 3.3.1(b)
, the notice of redemption will contain the information necessary to calculate the number of Class A Shares
to be received upon exercise of the Warrants, including the “Fair Market Value” (as such term is defined in
subsection
3.3.1(b)
hereof) in such case. On and after the Redemption Date, the record holder of the Warrants shall have no further rights except
to receive, upon surrender of the Warrants, the Redemption Price.
7.
Other Provisions Relating to Rights of Holders of Warrants
.
7.1
No Rights as Shareholder
. A Warrant does not entitle
the Registered Holder thereof to any of the rights of a shareholder of the Company, including, without limitation, the right to receive
dividends, or other distributions, exercise any preemptive rights to vote or to consent or to receive notice as shareholders in respect
of the meetings of shareholders or the election of directors of the Company or any other matter.
7.2
Lost, Stolen, Mutilated, or Destroyed Warrants
. If
any Warrant is lost, stolen, mutilated, or destroyed, the Company and the Warrant Agent may on such terms as to indemnity or otherwise
as they may in their discretion impose (which shall, in the case of a mutilated Warrant, include the surrender thereof), issue a new
Warrant of like denomination, tenor, and date as the Warrant so lost, stolen, mutilated, or destroyed. Any such new Warrant shall constitute
a substitute contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the allegedly lost, stolen, mutilated, or destroyed Warrant shall
be at any time enforceable by anyone.
7.3
Reservation of Class A Shares
. The Company shall at
all times reserve and keep available a number of its authorized but unissued Class A Shares that shall be sufficient to permit the exercise
in full of all outstanding Warrants issued pursuant to this Agreement.
-

-
7.4
Registration of Class A Shares; Cashless Exercise at Company’s
Option
.
7.4.1
Registration of the Class A Shares
. The Company agrees
that as soon as practicable, but in no event later than twenty (20) Business Days after the closing of its initial Business Combination,
it shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to file with the Commission a post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement,
or a new registration statement registering, under the Securities Act, the issuance of the Class A Shares issuable upon exercise of the
Warrants. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the same to become effective and to maintain the effectiveness
of such post-effective amendment or registration statement, and a current prospectus relating thereto, until the expiration or redemption
of the Warrants in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. If any such post-effective or registration statement has not been
declared effective by the sixtieth (60th) Business Day following the closing of the initial Business Combination, holders of the Warrants
shall have the right, during the period beginning on the sixty-first (61st) Business Day after the closing of the initial Business Combination
and ending upon such post-effective amendment or registration statement being declared effective by the Commission, and during any other
period when the Company shall fail to have maintained an effective registration statement covering the Class A Shares issuable upon exercise
of the Warrants, to exercise such Warrants on a “cashless basis,” by exchanging the Warrants (in accordance with Section
3(a)(9) of the Securities Act (or any successor rule) or another exemption) for that number of Class A Shares equal to the quotient obtained
by dividing (x) the product of the number of Class A Shares underlying the Warrants, multiplied by the excess of the “Fair Market
Value” (as defined below) over the Warrant Price by (y) the Fair Market Value. Solely for purposes of this
subsection 7.4.1
,
“Fair Market Value” shall mean the average reported closing price of the Class A Shares as reported during the ten (10) trading
day period ending on the third (3rd) trading day prior to the date that notice of exercise is received by the Warrant Agent from the
holder of such Warrants or its securities broker or intermediary. The date that notice of “cashless exercise” is received
by the Warrant Agent shall be conclusively determined by the Warrant Agent. In connection with the “cashless exercise” of
a Public Warrant, the Company shall, upon request, provide the Warrant Agent with an opinion of counsel for the Company (which shall
be an outside law firm with securities law experience) stating that (i) the exercise of the Warrants on a “cashless basis”
in accordance with this
subsection 7.4.1
is not required to be registered under the Securities Act and (ii) the Class A Shares
issued upon such exercise shall be freely tradable under United States federal securities laws by anyone who is not an affiliate (as
such term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act (or any successor rule)) of the Company and, accordingly, shall not be required
to bear a restrictive legend. Except as provided in
subsection 7.4.2
, for the avoidance of any doubt, unless and until all of
the Warrants have been exercised or have expired, the Company shall continue to be obligated to comply with its registration obligations
under the first three sentences of this
subsection 7.4.1
.
7.4.2
Cashless Exercise at Company’s Option
. If the
Class A Shares are at the time of any exercise of a Warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that they satisfy the definition
of “covered securities” under Section 18(b)(1) of the Securities Act (or any successor rule), the Company may, at its option,
require holders of Warrants who exercise their Warrants to exercise such Public Warrants on a “cashless basis” in accordance
with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities Act (or any successor rule) as described in
subsection 7.4.1
and (i) in the event the Company
so elects, the Company shall not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement for the registration, under the Securities
Act, of the Class A Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary or (ii)
if the Company does not so file or maintain such registration statement, the Company agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts
to register or qualify for sale the Class A Shares issuable upon exercise of the Public Warrants under the applicable blue sky laws of
the state of residence of the exercising Public Warrant holder to the extent an exemption is not available.

Concerning the Warrant Agent and Other Matters
.
8.1
Payment of Taxes
. The Company shall from time to time
promptly pay all taxes and charges that may be imposed upon the Company or the Warrant Agent in respect of the issuance or delivery of
Class A Shares upon the exercise of the Warrants, but the Company shall not be obligated to pay any transfer taxes in respect of the
Warrants or such Class A Shares.
8.2
Resignation, Consolidation, or Merger of Warrant Agent
.
8.2.1
Appointment of Successor Warrant Agent
. The Warrant
Agent, or any successor to it hereafter appointed, may resign its duties and be discharged from all further duties and liabilities hereunder
after giving sixty (60) days’ notice in writing to the Company. If the office of the Warrant Agent becomes vacant by resignation
or incapacity to act or otherwise, the Company shall appoint in writing a successor Warrant Agent in place of the Warrant Agent. If the
Company shall fail to make such appointment within a period of thirty (30) days after it has been notified in writing of such resignation
or incapacity by the Warrant Agent or by the holder of a Warrant (who shall, with such notice, submit his, her or its Warrant for inspection
by the Company), then the holder of any Warrant may apply to the Supreme Court of the State of New York for the County of New York for
the appointment of a successor Warrant Agent at the Company’s cost. Any successor Warrant Agent, whether appointed by the Company
or by such court, shall be a corporation or other entity organized and existing under the laws of the State of New York, in good standing
and having its principal office in the Borough of Manhattan, City and State of New York, and authorized under such laws to exercise corporate
trust powers and subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authority. After appointment, any successor Warrant Agent
shall be vested with all the authority, powers, rights, immunities, duties, and obligations of its predecessor Warrant Agent with like
effect as if originally named as Warrant Agent hereunder, without any further act or deed; but if for any reason it becomes necessary
or appropriate, the predecessor Warrant Agent shall execute and deliver, at the expense of the Company, an instrument transferring to
such successor Warrant Agent all the authority, powers, and rights of such predecessor Warrant Agent hereunder; and upon request of any
successor Warrant Agent the Company shall make, execute, acknowledge, and deliver any and all instruments in writing for more fully and
effectually vesting in and confirming to such successor Warrant Agent all such authority, powers, rights, immunities, duties, and obligations.
8.2.2
Notice of Successor Warrant Agent
. In the event a
successor Warrant Agent shall be appointed, the Company shall give notice thereof to the predecessor Warrant Agent and the Transfer Agent
for the Class A Shares not later than the effective date of any such appointment.
8.2.3

. Any entity
into which the Warrant Agent may be merged or with which it may be consolidated or any entity resulting from any merger or consolidation
to which the Warrant Agent shall be a party shall be the successor Warrant Agent under this Agreement without any further act.
8.3
Fees and Expenses of Warrant Agent
.
8.3.1
Remuneration
. The Company agrees to pay the Warrant
Agent reasonable remuneration for its services as such Warrant Agent hereunder and shall, pursuant to its obligations under this Agreement,
reimburse the Warrant Agent upon demand for all expenditures that the Warrant Agent may reasonably incur in the execution of its duties
hereunder.
8.3.2
Further Assurances
. The Company agrees to perform,
execute, acknowledge, and deliver or cause to be performed, executed, acknowledged, and delivered all such further and other acts, instruments,
and assurances as may reasonably be required by the Warrant Agent for the carrying out or performing of the provisions of this Agreement.

8.4
Liability of Warrant Agent
.
8.4.1
Reliance on Company Statement
. Whenever in the performance
of its duties under this Agreement, the Warrant Agent shall deem it necessary or desirable that any fact or matter be proved or established
by the Company prior to taking or suffering any action hereunder, such fact or matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein
specifically prescribed) may be deemed to be conclusively proved and established by a statement signed by the Chief Executive Officer,
Chief Financial Officer, President, Executive Vice President, Vice President, Secretary or Chairman of the Board of the Company and delivered
to the Warrant Agent. The Warrant Agent may rely upon such statement for any action taken or suffered in good faith by it pursuant to
the provisions of this Agreement.
8.4.2
Indemnity
. The Warrant Agent shall be liable hereunder
only for its own gross negligence, willful misconduct, fraud or bad faith. The Company agrees to indemnify the Warrant Agent and save
it harmless against any and all liabilities, including judgments, out of pocket costs and reasonable outside counsel fees, for anything
done or omitted by the Warrant Agent in the execution of this Agreement, except as a result of the Warrant Agent’s gross negligence,
willful misconduct, fraud or bad faith.
8.4.3
Exclusions
. The Warrant Agent shall have no responsibility
with respect to the validity of this Agreement or with respect to the validity or execution of any Warrant (except its countersignature
thereof). The Warrant Agent shall not be responsible for any breach by the Company of any covenant or condition contained in this Agreement
or in any Warrant. The Warrant Agent shall not be responsible to make any adjustments required under the provisions of
Section 4
hereof or responsible for the manner, method, or amount of any such adjustment or the ascertaining of the existence of facts that would
require any such adjustment; nor shall it by any act hereunder be deemed to make any representation or warranty as to the authorization
or reservation of any Class A Shares to be issued pursuant to this Agreement or any Warrant or as to whether any Class A Shares shall,
when issued, be valid and fully paid and non-assessable.
8.5
Acceptance of Agency
. The Warrant Agent hereby accepts
the agency established by this Agreement and agrees to perform the same upon the terms and conditions herein set forth and among other
things, shall account promptly to the Company with respect to Warrants exercised and concurrently account for, and pay to the Company,
all monies received by the Warrant Agent for the purchase of Class A Shares through the exercise of the Warrants.
8.6
Waiver
. The Warrant Agent has no right of set-off
or any other right, title, interest or claim of any kind (“
Claim
”) in, or to any distribution of, the Trust
Account (as defined in that certain Investment Management Trust Agreement, dated as of the date hereof, by and between the Company and
the Warrant Agent as trustee thereunder) and hereby agrees not to seek recourse, reimbursement, payment or satisfaction for any Claim
against the Trust Account for any reason whatsoever. The Warrant Agent hereby irrevocably waives any and all Claims against the Trust
Account, including any monies therein or any distribution therefrom, and any and all rights to seek access to the Trust Account.

Applicable Law and Exclusive Forum
. The validity,
interpretation, and performance of this Agreement and of the Warrants shall be governed in all respects by the laws of the State of New
York, without giving effect to conflicts of law principles that would result in the application of the substantive laws of another jurisdiction.
The Company hereby agrees that any action, proceeding or claim against it arising out of or relating in any way to this Agreement shall
be brought and enforced in the courts of the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York,
and irrevocably submits to such jurisdiction, which jurisdiction shall be the exclusive forum for any such action, proceeding or claim.
The Company hereby waives any objection to such exclusive jurisdiction and that such courts represent an inconvenient forum. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the provisions of this paragraph will not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange
Act or any other claim for which the federal district courts of the United States of America are the sole and exclusive forum. Any person
or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in the Warrants shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the
forum provisions in this
Section 9.3
. If any action, the subject matter of which is within the scope the forum provisions above,
is filed in a court other than a court located within the State of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern District
of New York (a “
foreign action
”) in the name of any warrant holder, such warrant holder shall be deemed to
have consented to: (x) the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located within the State of New York or the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York in connection with any action brought in any such court to enforce the forum provisions
(an “
enforcement action
”), and (y) having service of process made upon such warrant holder in any such enforcement
action by service upon such warrant holder’s counsel in the foreign action as agent for such warrant holder.

Warrant Certificate
This Warrant Certificate certifies that                    , or registered
assigns, is the registered holder of warrants evidenced hereby (the “
Warrants
” and each, a “
Warrant
”)
to purchase Class A Ordinary Shares, $0.0001 par value per share (the “
Ordinary Shares
”), of Praetorian Acquisition
Corp., a Cayman Islands exempted company (the “
Company
”). Each whole Warrant entitles the holder, upon exercise during
the period set forth in the Warrant Agreement referred to below, to receive from the Company that number of fully paid and non-assessable
Ordinary Shares as set forth below, at the exercise price (the “
Warrant Price
”) as determined pursuant to the Warrant
Agreement, payable in lawful money (or through “cashless exercise” as provided for in the Warrant Agreement) of the United
States of America upon surrender of this Warrant Certificate and payment of the Warrant Price at the office or agency of the Warrant Agent
referred to below, subject to the conditions set forth herein and in the Warrant Agreement. Defined terms used in this Warrant Certificate
but not defined herein shall have the meanings given to them in the Warrant Agreement.
Each whole Warrant is initially exercisable for
one fully paid and non-assessable Ordinary Share. No fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of any Warrant. If, upon the exercise
of Warrants, a holder would be entitled to receive a fractional interest in an Ordinary Share, the Company will, upon exercise, round
down to the nearest whole number the number of Ordinary Shares to be issued to the Warrant holder. The number of Ordinary Shares issuable
upon exercise of the Warrants is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events set forth in the Warrant Agreement.
The initial Warrant Price per Ordinary Share for
any Warrant is equal to $11.50 per share. The Warrant Price is subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of certain events set forth in
the Warrant Agreement.
Subject to the conditions set forth in the Warrant
Agreement, the Warrants may be exercised only during the Exercise Period and to the extent not exercised by the end of such Exercise Period,
such Warrants shall become void. The Warrants may be redeemed, subject to certain conditions, as set forth in the Warrant Agreement. In
addition, and notwithstanding anything else in this Warrant Certificate or the Warrant Agreement, to the extent that the holder of a Warrant
has delivered a notice contemplated by
subsection 3.5.5
of the Warrant Agreement, neither the Company nor the Warrant Agent shall
issue to Holder, and Holder may not acquire, any right it might have to acquire, a number of Ordinary Shares upon exercise of any Warrant
to the extent that, upon such exercise, the number of Ordinary Shares then beneficially owned by Holder would exceed the Maximum Percentage
of Ordinary Shares outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise as determined in accordance with
subsection 3.3.5
of the Warrant Agreement.
Reference is hereby made to the further provisions
of this Warrant Certificate set forth on the reverse hereof and such further provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as
though fully set forth at this place.
This Warrant Certificate shall not be valid unless
countersigned by the Warrant Agent, as such term is used in the Warrant Agreement.

[Reverse]
The Warrants evidenced by this Warrant Certificate
are part of a duly authorized issue of Warrants entitling the holder on exercise to receive Ordinary Shares and are issued or to be issued
pursuant to a Warrant Agreement dated as of [●], 2025 (the “
Warrant Agreement
”), duly executed and delivered
by the Company to Odyssey Transfer and Trust Company, a Minnesota corporation, as warrant agent (the “
Warrant Agent
”),
which Warrant Agreement is hereby incorporated by reference in and made a part of this instrument and is hereby referred to for a description
of the rights, limitation of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Warrant Agent, the Company and the holders (the
words “
holders
” or “
holder
” meaning the Registered Holders or Registered Holder, respectively) of
the Warrants. A copy of the Warrant Agreement may be obtained by the holder hereof upon written request to the Company. Defined terms
used in this Warrant Certificate but not defined herein shall have the meanings given to them in the Warrant Agreement.
Warrants may be exercised at any time during the
Exercise Period set forth in the Warrant Agreement. The holder of Warrants evidenced by this Warrant Certificate may exercise them by
surrendering this Warrant Certificate, with the form of election to purchase set forth hereon properly completed and executed, together
with payment of the Warrant Price as specified in the Warrant Agreement (or through “cashless exercise” as provided for in
the Warrant Agreement) at the principal corporate trust office of the Warrant Agent. In the event that upon any exercise of Warrants evidenced
hereby the number of Warrants exercised shall be less than the total number of Warrants evidenced hereby, there shall be issued to the
holder hereof or his, her or its assignee, a new Warrant Certificate evidencing the number of Warrants not exercised.
Notwithstanding anything else in this Warrant
Certificate or the Warrant Agreement, no Warrant may be exercised unless at the time of exercise (i) a registration statement covering
the Ordinary Shares to be issued upon exercise is effective under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and (ii) a prospectus thereunder
relating to the Ordinary Shares is current, except through “cashless exercise” as provided for in the Warrant Agreement.
The Warrant Agreement provides that upon the occurrence
of certain events the number of Ordinary Shares issuable upon the exercise of the Warrants set forth on the face hereof may, subject to
certain conditions, be adjusted. If, upon exercise of a Warrant, the holder thereof would be entitled to receive a fractional interest
in an Ordinary Share, the Company shall, upon exercise, round down to the nearest whole number of Ordinary Shares to be issued to the
holder of the Warrant.
Warrant Certificates, when surrendered at the
principal corporate trust office of the Warrant Agent by the Registered Holder thereof in person or by legal representative or attorney
duly authorized in writing, may be exchanged, in the manner and subject to the limitations provided in the Warrant Agreement, but without
payment of any service charge, for another Warrant Certificate or Warrant Certificates of like tenor evidencing in the aggregate a like
number of Warrants.
Upon due presentation for registration of transfer
of this Warrant Certificate at the office of the Warrant Agent, a new Warrant Certificate or Warrant Certificates of like tenor and evidencing
in the aggregate a like number of Warrants shall be issued to the transferee(s) in exchange for this Warrant Certificate, subject to the
limitations provided in the Warrant Agreement, without charge except for any tax or other governmental charge imposed in connection therewith.
The Company and the Warrant Agent may deem and
treat the Registered Holder(s) hereof as the absolute owner(s) of this Warrant Certificate (notwithstanding any notation of ownership
or other writing hereon made by anyone), for the purpose of any exercise hereof, of any distribution to the holder(s) hereof, and for
all other purposes, and neither the Company nor the Warrant Agent shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. Neither the Warrants
nor this Warrant Certificate entitles any holder hereof to any rights of a shareholder of the Company.
