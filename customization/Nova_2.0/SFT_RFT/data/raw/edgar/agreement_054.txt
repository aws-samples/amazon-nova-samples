applicable, or any similarly situated businesses in any jurisdiction in which the Borrower or any Subsidiary does business, as applicable.
(b) with respect to any Default or Event of Default, the words “exists,” “is continuing” or similar expressions with
respect thereto shall mean that the Default or Event of Default has occurred and has not yet been cured or waived. In the case of any cure or waiver, the Borrower, the applicable Loan Parties, the Lenders and the Administrative Agent shall be
restored to their former positions and rights hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, and any Default or Event of Default cured or waived shall be deemed to be cured and not continuing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no such
cure or waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon. For the avoidance of doubt, if (i) any Default or Event of Default under this Agreement (a “
Subject
Default
”) occurs under any covenant or obligation under any Loan Documents (other than, for the avoidance of doubt, Event of Default arising under
Section
7.01(a)
or any Event of Default under
Section
6.12
), (ii) the Borrower has delivered any notice required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent promptly upon obtaining actual knowledge that such Subject Default exists,
80
(iii)(A) the event, condition or inaction giving rise to such Subject Default no longer exists and is not continuing, including as a result of the Borrower or applicable Subsidiary having
taken the required action giving rise to such Subject Default or (B) such Subject Default shall otherwise have been cured or waived, and (iv) there has not been any acceleration of Loans or Obligations following such Subject Default, then
such Subject Default and each other Default or Event of Default that may have resulted from the making or deemed making of any representation or warranty as to, or the taking of any action or consummation of any transaction conditioned upon, the
absence of any existing or continuing Default or Event of Default, in each case, related to the Subject Default, shall automatically be deemed to have been cured and no longer continuing; provided that the Subject Default and each other Default or
Event of Default shall not be deemed cured and no longer continuing:
(i) if there is a taking of any action by any Loan
Party or Subsidiary of a Loan Party that is not permitted during, and as a result of, the continuance of such Subject Default and the Borrower had actual knowledge at the time of taking any such action that the Subject Default had occurred and was
continuing;
(ii) (x) in the case of a Subject Default for which a Responsible Officer of the Borrower failed to give
notice to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders of such Subject Default in accordance with
Section
5.02(a)
of this Agreement and (y) a Responsible Officer of the Borrower had actual knowledge of such failure to give
such notice; or
(iii) in the case of an Event of Default for which the Administrative Agent (at the direction of the
Required Lenders) has accelerated the Loans and terminated the Commitments pursuant to
Section
7.01
.
SECTION
1.04
Accounting Terms; GAAP; Fiscal Periods
.
Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all terms of an accounting or
financial nature shall be construed in accordance with GAAP as in effect from time to time;
provided
that if the Borrower notifies the Administrative Agent that the Borrower requests an amendment to any provision (including any definition)
hereof to eliminate the effect of any change occurring after the date hereof in GAAP or in the application thereof on the operation of such provision (or if the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower in writing that the Required Lenders request
an amendment to any provision (including any definition) hereof for such purpose), regardless of whether any such notice is given before or after such change in GAAP or in the application thereof, then such provision shall be interpreted on the
basis of GAAP as in effect and applied immediately before such change shall have become effective until such notice shall have been withdrawn or such provision has been amended in accordance herewith. In addition, notwithstanding any other provision
contained herein, all terms of an accounting or financial nature used herein shall be construed, and all computations of amounts and ratios referred to herein shall be made, without giving effect to (A) any election under ASC Topic 825 to
value any Indebtedness or other liabilities of the Borrower or any Subsidiary at “fair value”, as defined therein and (B) the portion of any Indebtedness attributable to any
non-wholly
owned
Subsidiary that corresponds to the
non-controlling
interest share owned by third parties in such
non-wholly
owned Subsidiary. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement or any other Loan Document, references in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to any fiscal quarter end or fiscal year end shall be deemed to refer to the date on or about the applicable month end on which the Borrower’s
and its Subsidiaries’ fiscal quarter or fiscal year, as the case may be, actually ends in accordance with their fiscal calendar.
81
SECTION 1.05
Timing of Payment or Performance
. When the payment of any obligation, or
the performance of any covenant, duty or obligation, under any Loan Document is stated to be due or performance required on a day that is not a Business Day, the date of such payment (other than as specifically provided herein, including as
described in the definition of “Interest Period”) or performance shall extend to the immediately succeeding Business Day.
SECTION 1.06
Available Amount Transactions
. If more than one action occurs on any given date the permissibility of the taking of which
is determined hereunder by reference to the amount of the Available Amount immediately prior to the taking of such action, the permissibility of the taking of each such action shall be determined independently and in no event may any two or more
such actions be treated as occurring simultaneously.
SECTION 1.07
Pro Forma Calculations
.
(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, all financial ratios and tests, including the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio, the Secured
Net Leverage Ratio and the Total Net Leverage Ratio, and compliance with covenants determined by reference to Consolidated EBITDA or Total Assets, shall be calculated in the manner prescribed by this Section 1.07;
provided
that
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 1.07(b), (c), (d) or (f), (A) when calculating the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio for purposes of Section 6.12 (other than for the purpose of determining Pro Forma Compliance with
Section 6.12), the events described in this Section 1.07 that occurred subsequent to the end of the applicable Test Period shall not be given Pro Forma Effect and cash and Permitted Investments included on the consolidated balance sheet of
the Borrower and its Restricted Subsidiaries as of the date of the event for which the calculation of any such ratio is made shall be taken into account in lieu of cash or Permitted Investments as of the last day of the relevant Test Period and
(B) when calculating any such ratio or test for purposes of the incurrence of any Indebtedness, cash and Permitted Investments resulting from the incurrence of any such Indebtedness shall be excluded from the pro forma calculation of any
applicable ratio or test. In addition, whenever a financial ratio or test is to be calculated on a Pro Forma Basis, the reference to the “Test Period” for purposes of calculating such financial ratio or test shall be deemed to be a
reference to, and shall be based on, the most recently ended Test Period for which financial statements of the Borrower have been delivered prior to the Closing Date or pursuant to Section 5.01(a) or Section 5.01(b) (it being understood
that for purposes of determining Pro Forma Compliance with Section 6.12, if no Test Period with an applicable level cited in Section 6.12 has passed, the applicable level shall be the level for the first Test Period cited in
Section 6.12 with an indicated level).
(b) For purposes of calculating any financial ratio or test or compliance with any covenant
determined by reference to Consolidated EBITDA or Total Assets, Specified Transactions (with any incurrence or repayment of any Indebtedness in connection therewith to be subject to Section 1.07(d)) that (i) have been made during the
applicable Test Period or (ii) if applicable, as described in Section 1.07(a), have been made subsequent to such Test Period and
82
prior to or substantially concurrently with the event for which the calculation of any such ratio or test is made shall be calculated on a Pro Forma Basis assuming that all such Specified
Transactions (and any increase or decrease in Consolidated EBITDA, Total Assets and the component financial definitions used therein attributable to any Specified Transaction) had occurred on the first day of the applicable Test Period (or, in the
case of Total Assets, on the last day of the applicable Test Period). If since the beginning of any applicable Test Period any Person that subsequently became a Restricted Subsidiary or was merged, amalgamated or consolidated with or into the
Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries since the beginning of such Test Period shall have made any Specified Transaction that would have required adjustment pursuant to this Section 1.07, then such financial ratio or test (or Total
Assets) shall be calculated to give Pro Forma Effect thereto in accordance with this Section 1.07.
(c) Whenever Pro Forma Effect is
to be given to a Specified Transaction, the pro forma calculations shall be made in good faith by a Responsible Officer of the Borrower and, in the case of any “Test Period” determined by reference to financial statements of the Borrower
most recently delivered prior to the Closing Date or pursuant to Section 5.01(a) or Section 5.01(b), and may include, for the avoidance of doubt, the amount of
“run-rate”
cost savings,
operating expense reductions and synergies resulting from or relating to, any Specified Transaction (including the Transactions) to the extent permitted by the definition of “Consolidated EBITDA” (it being understood that Pro Forma
Effect shall be given to the deemed Consolidated EBITDA figures at the end of the definition thereof for any Test Periods including periods ending prior to the Closing Date).
(d) In the event that the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary incurs (including by assumption or guarantees) or repays (including by
repurchase, redemption, repayment, retirement, discharge, defeasance or extinguishment) any Indebtedness (in each case, other than Indebtedness incurred or repaid (other than any repayment from the proceeds of other Indebtedness) under any revolving
credit facility for ordinary course working capital purposes) during the applicable Test Period or subsequent to the end of the applicable Test Period and prior to or simultaneously with the event for which the calculation of any such ratio is made,
then such financial ratio or test shall be calculated giving Pro Forma Effect to such incurrence, assumption, guarantee, repurchase, redemption, repayment, retirement, discharge, defeasance or extinguishment of Indebtedness, or such issuance,
repurchase or redemption of Disqualified Stock, in each case to the extent required, as if the same had occurred on the last day of the applicable Test Period.
(e) [Reserved].
(f) As relates
to any action being taken solely in connection with a Limited Condition Transaction, for purposes of:
(i) determining
compliance with any provision of this Agreement which requires the calculation of any financial ratio or test, including the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio, the Secured Net Leverage Ratio and the Total Net Leverage Ratio,
(ii) testing availability under baskets set forth in this Agreement (including baskets determined by reference to Consolidated
EBITDA or Total Assets),
83
(iii) determining the accuracy of any representation or warranty, or
(iv) determining whether any Default or Event of Default has occurred, is continuing or would result from any action,
in each case, at the option of the Borrower (the Borrower’s election to exercise such option in connection with any Limited Condition Transaction,
an “
LCT Election
”), the date of determination of whether any such action is permitted hereunder shall be deemed to be the date that the definitive agreements for such Limited Condition Transaction are entered into, the date
of an irrevocable declaration in respect of such Limited Condition Transaction is made or the date the irrevocable prepayment or redemption notice of such Limited Condition Transaction is provided to the applicable holders, as the case may be
(the “
LCT Test Date
”) (and not, for the avoidance of doubt, the date of consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction unless specifically selected by the Borrower), and if, after giving Pro Forma Effect to the Limited
Condition Transaction (and the other transactions to be entered into in connection therewith, including any incurrence of Indebtedness (including any Incremental Facilities and Permitted Incremental Equivalent Debt) and the use of proceeds thereof,
as if they had occurred on the first day of the most recent Test Period ending prior to the LCT Test Date (except with respect to any incurrence or repayment of Indebtedness for purposes of the calculation of any leverage-based test or ratio, which
shall in each case be treated as if they had occurred on the last day of such Test Period)), the Borrower or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries would have been permitted to take such action on the relevant LCT Test Date in compliance with such
ratio, test or basket, representation and warranty, or Default or Event of Default “blocker”, shall be deemed to have been complied with (and no Default or Event of Default shall be deemed to have arisen thereafter with respect to such
Limited Condition Transaction from any such failure to comply with such ratio, basket, covenant, or representation and warranty);
provided
that if financial statements for one or more subsequent fiscal periods shall have become available, the
Borrower may elect, in its sole discretion, to redetermine all such ratios, tests or baskets on the basis of such financial statements, in which case, such date of redetermination shall thereafter be deemed to be the applicable LCT Test Date. For
the avoidance of doubt, if the Borrower has made an LCT Election and any ratio, test or basket, representation and warranty, or Default or Event of Default “blocker” for which compliance was determined or tested as of the LCT Test Date
would have failed to have been complied with as a result of fluctuations in any such ratio, test or basket, representation and warranty, or Default or Event of Default “blocker”, including due to fluctuations in Consolidated EBITDA,
Unrestricted Cash, Consolidated Total Net Indebtedness or Total Assets of the Borrower or the Person subject to such Limited Condition Transaction, at or prior to the consummation of the relevant transaction or action, such ratio, test or basket,
representation and warranty, or Default or Event of Default “blocker” will not be deemed to have failed to have been complied with as a result of such fluctuations. If the Borrower has made an LCT Election for any Limited Condition
Transaction, then in connection with any calculation of any ratio, test or basket availability with respect to the incurrence of Indebtedness or Liens, the making of Restricted Payments, the making of any Investment, mergers, the conveyance, sale or
other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Borrower, the prepayment, redemption, purchase, defeasance or other satisfaction of Indebtedness, or the designation of an Unrestricted Subsidiary (each, a “
Subsequent
Transaction
”) following the relevant LCT Test Date and prior to the earlier of the date on which such Limited Condition Transaction is consummated or the date that the definitive agreement, irrevocable declaration or irrevocable notice for
such Limited Condition Transaction is terminated or expires
84
without consummation of such Limited Condition Transaction, for purposes of determining whether such Subsequent Transaction is permitted under this Agreement, any such ratio, test or basket,
representation and warranty, or Default or Event of Default “blocker” shall be required to be satisfied on a Pro Forma Basis assuming such Limited Condition Transaction and other transactions in connection therewith (including any
incurrence of Indebtedness and the use of proceeds thereof) have been consummated. In addition to, and without limiting the foregoing, the lenders in respect of any Limited Condition Transaction may agree to limit conditionality with respect to
delivery of Collateral consistent with customary “Sungard” limitations and may agree to limit the making and required accuracy of representations and warranties of the Loan Parties to the Specified Representations and Permitted
Acquisition Company Representations.
SECTION 1.08
Rates
. The Administrative Agent does not warrant or accept any responsibility
for (other than as specifically set forth in Section 2.14), and shall not have any liability with respect to, (a) the continuation of, administration of, submission of, calculation of or any other matter related to the Term SOFR Reference
Rate or Term SOFR, or any component definition thereof or rates referred to in the definition thereof or with respect to any alternative, successor or replacement rate thereto (including any Benchmark Replacement), including whether the composition
or characteristics of any such alternative, successor or replacement rate (including any Benchmark Replacement), as it may or may not be adjusted pursuant to Section 2.14(c), will be similar to, or produce the same value or economic equivalence
of, or have the same volume or liquidity as, the Term SOFR Reference Rate, Term SOFR or any other Benchmark prior to its discontinuance or unavailability or (b) the effect, implementation or composition of any Conforming Changes. The
Administrative Agent may select information sources or services in its reasonable discretion to ascertain the Term SOFR Reference Rate or Term SOFR, or any other Benchmark, any component definition thereof or rates referred to in the definition
thereof, in each case pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement, shall have no liability to the Borrower, any Lender or any other person or entity for damages of any kind, including direct or
indirect, special, punitive, incidental or consequential damages, costs, losses or expenses (whether in tort, contract or otherwise and whether at law or in equity), for any error or calculation of any such rate (or component thereof) provided by
any such information source or service.
SECTION 1.09
Divisions
. For all purposes under the Loan Documents, in connection with any
division or plan of division under Delaware law (or any comparable event under a different jurisdiction’s laws): (a) if any asset, right, obligation or liability of any Person becomes the asset, right, obligation or liability of a
different Person, then it shall be deemed to have been transferred from the original Person to the subsequent Person, and (b) if any new Person comes into existence, such new Person shall be deemed to have been organized and acquired on the
first date of its existence by the holders of its Equity Interests at such time.
SECTION 1.10
Currency Equivalents Generally
. (a)
Any amount specified in this Agreement (other than in Articles II, VIII and IX or as set forth in Section 1.10(b)) or any other Loan Document to be in dollars shall also include the dollar equivalent of such amount (as determined by the
Borrower in good faith on the applicable date of determination based on information published by ICE Data Service or another nationally recognized source of quotations or currency exchange rates) (the “
Covenant Exchange
Rate
”);
provided
that if any basket is exceeded solely as a result of fluctuations in applicable currency exchange rates after the last time such basket was utilized, such basket will not be deemed to have been exceeded solely as a
result of such fluctuations in currency exchange rates.
85
(b) For purposes of determining the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio, the Total Net Leverage
Ratio and the Secured Net Leverage Ratio, amounts denominated in a currency other than dollars will be converted to dollars for the purposes of (i) testing the Financial Covenant, at the Covenant Exchange Rate of such amount as of the last day
of the fiscal quarter for which such measurement is being made and (ii) calculating the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio (other than for the purpose of determining compliance with Section 6.12), the Secured Net Leverage Ratio and the Total
Net Leverage Ratio, at the Covenant Exchange Rate of such amount as of the date of determination, and will, in the case of Indebtedness, be the weighted average exchange rates used for determining Consolidated EBITDA for the relevant period
determined in accordance with GAAP;
provided
that if the Borrower or any Restricted Subsidiary has entered into any currency Swap Agreements in respect of any Borrowings, the dollar equivalent amount of such Borrowings shall be determined by
first taking into account the effects of that currency Swap Agreement.
(c) The Administrative Agent or any Issuing Bank, as applicable,
shall use the Covenant Exchange Rate as of each Revaluation Date for the purpose of calculating Dollar Equivalent of the Revolving Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency. Such currency exchange rates shall become effective as of such
Revaluation Date and shall be the currency exchange rate employed in converting any amounts between the applicable currencies for such purposes until the next Revaluation Date to occur.
(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) any representation or warranty that would be untrue or inaccurate,
(ii) any covenant that would be breached or (iii) any event that would constitute a Default or an Event of Default, in each case, solely as a result of fluctuations (or other adverse changes) in applicable currency exchange rates, shall
not be deemed to be untrue, inaccurate, breached or so constituted, as applicable, solely as a result of such fluctuations (or adverse changes) in currency exchange rates.
(e) Wherever in this Agreement in connection with a Borrowing, conversion, continuation or prepayment of a SOFR Loan, the issuance, amendment
or extension of a Letter of Credit or any similar provision (including, for the avoidance of doubt, establishment of any Incremental Revolving Commitment or Incremental Term Commitment), an amount, such as a required minimum or multiple amount, is
expressed in dollars, but such Borrowing, SOFR Loan or Letter of Credit or other applicable loan or commitment is denominated in an Alternative Currency, such required minimum or multiple amount shall be, at the Borrower’s option, either
(i) a reference to the applicable
non-dollar
currency or (ii) the relevant Dollar Equivalent of such Alternative Currency, as determined by the Administrative Agent or the applicable Issuing Bank, as
the case may be.
SECTION 1.11
Calculation of Baskets
. If any of the baskets set forth in this Agreement are exceeded solely as a
result of fluctuations in Consolidated EBITDA, Unrestricted Cash, Consolidated Total Net Indebtedness and/or Total Assets for the most recently completed fiscal quarter after the last time such baskets were calculated for any purpose under this
Agreement, such baskets will not be deemed to have been exceeded solely as a result of such fluctuations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio, the Secured
86
Net Leverage Ratio and/or the Total Net Leverage Ratio for all purposes of Article II, Article V or Article VI shall be tested without giving effect to the incurrence of any
Indebtedness under any revolving facility (including the Revolving Credit Facility) immediately prior to, or substantially simultaneously with, any usage of a basket under Article II, Article V and Article VI that is determined by
reference to the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio, the Secured Net Leverage Ratio and/or the Total Net Leverage Ratio. For purposes of determining compliance with any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (i) in the event that
any action or transaction (or any portion thereof) meets the criteria of more than one of the categories of exceptions, thresholds or baskets pursuant to any provision set forth in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, the Borrower shall, in
its sole discretion, at the time of taking such action or consummation of such transaction, divide, classify or reclassify, or at any later time divide, classify or reclassify, such action or transaction as being incurred or taken under one or more
such exceptions, thresholds or baskets, including reclassifying any utilization of exceptions, baskets and thresholds that are based on a fixed amount (subject to a Consolidated EBITDA “grower” amount) (such exceptions, baskets and
thresholds, “fixed baskets”) as incurred or taken under any available exception, threshold or basket that is based on the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio, the Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Total Net Leverage Ratio (such exceptions,
baskets and thresholds, “incurrence-based baskets”), and if any applicable ratios or financial tests for such incurrence-based baskets would be satisfied in any subsequent fiscal quarter, such reclassification shall be deemed to have
automatically occurred if not elected by the Borrower and (ii) in the event that the Borrower shall classify any action or transaction on any date of determination as incurred or taken, in whole or in part, under any incurrence-based baskets,
then any calculation of the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio, the Secured Net Leverage Ratio or the Total Net Leverage Ratio on such date (but not in respect of any future calculation following such date) shall not include any action or transaction
incurred or taken pursuant to one or more fixed baskets.
SECTION 1.12
Additional Borrowers
.
(a) The
Pre-IPO
Borrower (1) may at any time, and from time to time, after the Closing Date, upon
not less than five (5) Business Days’ notice (or such shorter period as may be agreed by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion) and (2) shall, immediately following the consummation of a Qualified IPO, but in any event no
later than five (5) Business Days following the consummation of a Qualified IPO, by delivery to the Administrative Agent of a Borrower Designation Agreement duly executed by the
Pre-IPO
Borrower and
Parent Borrower, designate Parent Borrower as a “Borrower” for purposes of this Agreement. Such designation shall become effective upon the execution and delivery to the Administrative Agent of (i) the aforementioned executed
Borrower Designation Agreement, (ii) all amendments or joinders to this Agreement and any other Loan Document deemed reasonably necessary by the Administrative Agent to accommodate the joinder of such Parent Borrower as a Borrower hereunder,
(iii) if any Person is not already a Guarantor, all documents, schedules, instruments, certificates, agreements (including applicable Security Documents), guarantees, opinions and other documents, action, information and instruments as Parent
Borrower and each of its Restricted Subsidiaries shall be required to deliver to become a Guarantor by this Agreement, the Security Documents or any applicable Intercreditor Agreement (in each case, without giving effect to any grace periods for
delivery of such items, the updating of such information or the taking of such actions) (and, for the avoidance of doubt, if not already constituting Collateral, a pledge of 100% of the Capital Stock in Yellowstone Midco Holdings, LLC, Yellowstone
InterCo Holdings, LLC and Yellowstone
87
Borrower, LLC, and any other Restricted Subsidiary of Parent Borrower, other than an Excluded Subsidiary), (iv) to the extent available, a certificate as to the good standing of the Parent
Borrower as of a recent date and certificates and Organizational Documents in respect of the Parent Borrower and each such Restricted Subsidiary, similar to those delivered pursuant to Section 4.01(f), (v) a customary legal opinion of
counsel to the Parent Borrower and each such Restricted Subsidiary relating to the Parent Borrower and such Restricted Subsidiaries, (vi) a customary secretary’s certificate attaching such documents with respect to the Parent Borrower and
each such Restricted Subsidiary that are the equivalents of those delivered by the
Pre-IPO
Borrower on the Closing Date, (vii) a certificate of a Responsible Officer of the
Pre-IPO
Borrower stating that, as of the date the Parent Borrower joins this Agreement as such, no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and all documentation and other information required by
regulatory authorities under applicable “know your customer” and anti-money laundering rules and regulations. The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of such designation by the
Pre-IPO
Borrower and the effective date of such joinder. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Borrower Designation Agreement shall become effective as to Parent Borrower if it shall be unlawful
for Parent Borrower to become a Borrower hereunder or for any Lender to make Loans to Parent Borrower as provided herein.
(b) After the
Borrower Designation Agreement is effective, the Obligations of the
Pre-IPO
Borrower and Parent Borrower shall be joint and several in nature and subject to the provisions of Section 10.24, and from and
after any designation pursuant to this Section 1.12, all references herein to “the Borrower” shall be deemed to be a reference to Parent Borrower.
SECTION 1.13
Rounding
. Any financial ratios required to be maintained by the Borrower pursuant to this Agreement (or required to be
satisfied in order for a specific action to be permitted under this Agreement) shall be calculated by dividing the appropriate component by the other component, carrying the result to one place more than the number of places by which such ratio is
expressed herein and rounding the result up or down to the nearest number (with a rounding up if there is no nearest number).
SECTION
1.14
Letter of Credit Amounts
. Unless otherwise specified herein, the amount of a Letter of Credit at any time shall be deemed to be the stated amount of such Letter of Credit available to be drawn at such time;
provided
that
with respect to any Letter of Credit that, by its terms, provides for one or more automatic increases in the available amount thereof, the amount of such Letter of Credit shall be deemed to be the maximum amount of such Letter of Credit after giving
effect to all such increases, whether or not such maximum amount is available to be drawn at such time.
ARTICLE II
The Credits
SECTION 2.01
Commitments
. The Borrower and the Lenders acknowledge and agree that (a) each Lender with a Revolving Commitment agrees to make Revolving Loans denominated in dollars or in one or more Alternative Currencies to the Borrower on the
Closing Date and from time to time during the Revolving Availability Period in an aggregate principal amount that will not result in such Lender’s Revolving Exposure (together with the L/C Exposure of such Lender and obligations of such Lender
(other than the Swingline Lender) with respect to
88
outstanding Swingline Loans) exceeding such Lender’s Revolving Commitment, and (b) each Lender with an Initial Term Loan Commitment agrees to make a term loan “A”
(collectively, the “
Initial Term Loans
”) denominated in dollars to the Borrower on the Closing Date in an aggregate principal amount such that, immediately after giving effect thereto, the portion of the Initial Term Loans
held by each Lender is equal to the amount set forth opposite such Lender’s name in Schedule 2.01 under the heading “Initial Term Loan Commitment” (such Commitments, the “
Initial Term Loan Commitments
”). The
Borrower shall designate in the relevant Borrowing Request whether each Borrowing will be maintained as a SOFR Loan or an ABR Loan, and, if such Borrowing is to be a SOFR Borrowing, the Interest Period with respect thereto. Amounts repaid or prepaid
in respect of the Initial Term Loans may not be reborrowed.
SECTION 2.02
Loans and Borrowings
.
(a) Each Loan (other than a Swingline Loan) shall be made as part of a Borrowing consisting of Loans of the same Class and Type made by
the Lenders ratably in accordance with their respective Commitments of the applicable Class. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan required to be made by it shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligations hereunder;
pr
ovided
that the Commitments of the Lenders are several and no Lender shall be responsible for any other Lender’s failure to make Loans as required.
(b) Subject to Section 2.14, and except for (i) Swingline Loans, which shall always be ABR Loans and (ii) Revolving Loans
denominated in an Alternative Currency, which shall bear interest based on the applicable benchmark rate approved for such Alternative Currency pursuant to the definition thereof, each Borrowing in dollars shall be comprised entirely of ABR Loans or
SOFR Loans as the Borrower may request in accordance herewith.
(c) At the commencement of each Interest Period for any SOFR Borrowing,
such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of $100,000 (or such other amount acceptable to the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion) and not less than $500,000. At the time that each ABR Borrowing is
made, such Borrowing shall be in an aggregate amount that is an integral multiple of $100,000 (or such other amount acceptable to the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion) and not less than $100,000. Borrowings of more than one Type and
Class may be outstanding at the same time. There shall not at any time be more than a total of fifteen (15) SOFR Borrowings outstanding. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) an ABR Revolving Borrowing may be in an
aggregate amount that is equal to the entire unused balance of the aggregate Revolving Commitments and (ii) subject to Section 2.04(a), a Swingline Loan may be in an aggregate amount (y) that is equal to the entire unused balance of
the aggregate Revolving Commitments or (z) that is required to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as contemplated by Section 2.05(e).
(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Borrower shall not be entitled to request, or to elect to convert or continue,
any Borrowing in respect of Revolving Loans or Initial Term Loans if the Interest Period requested with respect thereto would end after the Revolving Maturity Date or the Initial Term Loan Maturity Date, as applicable.
89
SECTION 2.03
Requests for Borrowings
. To request a Revolving Borrowing or Term Loan
Borrowing, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such request in writing (a) in the case of a SOFR Borrowing, not later than 1:00 p.m., New York City time, three (3) U.S. Government Securities Business Days before the
date of the proposed Borrowing (or, in the case of the Borrowing of the Initial Term Loans or any Revolving Borrowing on the Closing Date, one (1) U.S. Government Securities Business Day before the date of such proposed Borrowing (or such
shorter period as may be agreed by the Administrative Agent)), (b) in the case of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 12:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date of the proposed Borrowing;
provided
that any such notice of an ABR
Revolving Borrowing to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as contemplated by Section 2.05(e) must be given not later than 12:00 p.m., New York City time, on the date of the proposed Borrowing or (c) in the case of any
Borrowing in an Alternative Currency, four (4) Business Days before the date of the proposed Borrowing (or, in each case under this Section 2.03, with such shorter period of advance notice as the Administrative Agent may agree in its
reasonable discretion). Each written Borrowing Request shall be signed by the Borrower. Each such written Borrowing Request shall specify the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:
(i) whether the requested Borrowing is to be a Revolving Borrowing or a Term Loan Borrowing,
(ii) the aggregate amount of such Borrowing,
(iii) the date of such Borrowing, which shall be a Business Day,
(iv) whether such Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a SOFR Borrowing,
(v) in the case of a SOFR Borrowing, the initial Interest Period to be applicable thereto, which shall be a period contemplated
by the definition of the term “Interest Period”,
(vi) in the case of a Revolving Borrowing, the currency in
which the Revolving Loans to be borrowed are to be denominated (which shall be dollars or an Alternative Currency), and
(vii) the location and number of the account(s) to which funds are to be disbursed, which shall comply with the requirements of
Section 2.06.
Subject to Section 2.02, if no election as to the currency of a Borrowing is specified, then the requested
Borrowing shall be made in dollars. If no election as to the Type of Borrowing is specified, then the requested Borrowing shall be a Term SOFR Borrowing made in dollars. If no Interest Period is specified with respect to any requested SOFR
Borrowing, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one (1) month’s duration. Promptly following receipt of a Borrowing Request in accordance with this Section 2.03, the Administrative Agent shall
advise each Lender of the details thereof and of the amount of such Lender’s Loan to be made as part of the requested Borrowing.

SECTION 2.04
Swingline
Loans
.
(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Swingline Lender agrees to make Swingline Loans to the Borrower in dollars from
time to time during the Revolving Availability Period, in an aggregate principal amount at any time outstanding that will not result in (i) the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Swingline Loans exceeding $15,000,000
(the “
Swingline Sublimit
”) or (ii) the aggregate Revolving Exposures exceeding the aggregate Revolving Commitments;
provided
that the Swingline Lender shall not be required to make a Swingline Loan to refinance an
outstanding Swingline Loan. Swingline Loans shall be made in minimum amounts of $500,000 and integral multiples of $100,000 above such amount. Within the foregoing limits and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrower may
borrow, prepay and reborrow Swingline Loans.
(b) To request a Swingline Loan, the Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent of such
request in writing, not later than 2:00 p.m., New York City time, on the day of a proposed Swingline Loan. Each such notice shall specify the requested date (which shall be a Business Day) and amount of the requested Swingline Loan. The
Administrative Agent will promptly advise the Swingline Lender of any such notice received from the Borrower. The Swingline Lender shall make each Swingline Loan available to the location and number of the account(s) to which funds are to be
disbursed, which shall comply with the requirements of Section 2.06 (or, in the case of a Swingline Loan made to finance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.05(e), by remittance to the applicable Issuing Bank)
by 3:00 p.m., New York City time, on the requested date of such Swingline Loan.
(c) The Swingline Lender may, and shall at least
once every thirty (30) days, by written notice given to the Administrative Agent not later than 12:00 noon, New York City time, on any Business Day require the Revolving Lenders to acquire participations on such Business Day in all or a
portion of the Swingline Loans outstanding. Such notice shall specify the aggregate amount of Swingline Loans in which Revolving Lenders will participate. Promptly upon receipt of such notice, the Administrative Agent will give notice thereof to
each Revolving Lender, specifying in such notice such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Swingline Loans. Each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees, upon receipt of notice as provided above, to
pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Swingline Lender, such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of such Swingline Loan or Swingline Loans. Each Revolving Lender acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire
participations in Swingline Loans pursuant to this clause (c) is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including the occurrence and continuance of a Default or an Event of Default or reduction or
termination of the Revolving Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever. Each Revolving Lender shall comply with its obligation under this clause (c) by wire transfer
of immediately available funds, in the same manner as provided in Section 2.06 with respect to Loans made by such Lender (and Section 2.06 shall apply,
mutatis mutandis
, to the payment obligations of the Revolving Lenders), and the
Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Swingline Lender the amounts so received by it from the Revolving Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower in writing of any participations in any Swingline Loan acquired pursuant to
this clause (c), and thereafter payments in respect of such Swingline Loan shall be made to the Administrative Agent and not to the Swingline Lender. Any amounts
91
received by the Swingline Lender from the Borrower (or other party on behalf of the Borrower) in respect of a Swingline Loan after receipt by the Swingline Lender of the proceeds of a sale of
participations therein shall be promptly remitted to the Administrative Agent, any such amounts received by the Administrative Agent shall be promptly remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Revolving Lenders that shall have made their payments
pursuant to this clause (c) and to the Swingline Lender, as their interests may appear;
provided
that any such payment so remitted shall be repaid to the Swingline Lender or to the Administrative Agent, as applicable, if and to the
extent such payment is required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason. The purchase of participations in a Swingline Loan pursuant to this clause (c) shall not relieve the Borrower of any default in the payment thereof.
(d) All Swingline Loans made to the Borrower shall be made in dollars as ABR Loans and shall not be entitled to be converted into SOFR Loans.
SECTION 2.05
Letters of Credit
.
(a)
General
. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the Borrower may request the issuance of Letters of Credit in
dollars (or any Alternative Currency agreed to by the Administrative Agent and the applicable Issuing Bank) for its own account (or for the account of any of its Subsidiaries so long as the Borrower is a
co-applicant),
in a form reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent and the applicable Issuing Bank, at any time and from time to time during the Revolving Availability Period. In the event of any
inconsistency between the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the terms and conditions of any form of letter of credit application or other agreement submitted by the Borrower to, or entered into by the Borrower with, the applicable Issuing
Bank relating to any Letter of Credit, the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall control.
(b)
Notice of Issuance, Amendment,
Renewal, Extension; Certain Conditions
. To request the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or the amendment, renewal or extension of an outstanding Letter of Credit), the Borrower shall hand deliver or telecopy (or transmit by electronic
communication if arrangements for doing so have been approved by the applicable Issuing Bank) to the applicable Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent (at least two (2) Business Days in advance of the requested date of issuance, amendment,
renewal or extension, or with such shorter period of advance notice as the applicable Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent may agree in their reasonable discretion) a notice requesting the issuance of a Letter of Credit, or identifying the
Letter of Credit to be amended, renewed or extended, and specifying the date of issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (which shall be a Business Day), the date on which such Letter of Credit is to expire (which shall comply with
Section 2.05(c)), the amount of such Letter of Credit, the name and address of the beneficiary thereof and such other information as shall be necessary to prepare, amend, renew or extend such Letter of Credit. If requested by the applicable
Issuing Bank, the Borrower also shall submit a letter of credit application on the applicable Issuing Bank’s standard form in connection with any request for a Letter of Credit. A Letter of Credit shall be issued, amended, renewed or extended
only if (and upon issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of each Letter of Credit the Borrower shall be deemed to represent and warrant that), after giving effect to such issuance, amendment, renewal or extension, (i) the L/C Exposure shall
not exceed $15,000,000 (the “
Letter of Credit Sublimit
”), (ii) no Revolving Lender’s Revolving Exposure (together with such Revolving Lender’s L/C Exposure and the obligations of such
92
Revolving Lender with respect to outstanding Swingline Loans) shall exceed such Revolving Lender’s Revolving Commitment, (iii) unless otherwise consented by the applicable Issuing Bank
in its sole discretion, the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Swingline Loans and Revolving Loans of such Issuing Bank, when aggregated with the L/C Exposure of such Issuing Bank, shall not exceed the amount of such Issuing Bank’s
Revolving Commitment, (iv) unless otherwise consented by the applicable Issuing Bank in its sole discretion, the L/C Exposure attributable to Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank shall not exceed such Issuing Bank’s Letter of
Credit Commitment and (v) the sum of the Total Revolving Credit Exposure shall not exceed the total Revolving Commitments. The Borrower may, at any time and from time to time, reduce the Letter of Credit Commitment of any Issuing Bank with the
consent of such Issuing Bank;
provided
that the Borrower shall not reduce the Letter of Credit Commitment of any Issuing Bank if, after giving effect of such reduction, the conditions set forth in clauses (i) through (v) above shall
not be satisfied.
(i) An Issuing Bank shall not be under any obligation to issue any Letter of Credit if:
(A) any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or arbitrator shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain
such Issuing Bank from issuing such Letter of Credit, or any law applicable to such Issuing Bank shall prohibit, or require that such Issuing Bank refrain from, the issuance of letters of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular or
shall impose upon such Issuing Bank with respect to such Letter of Credit any restriction, reserve or capital requirement (for which such Issuing Bank is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect on the Closing Date, or shall impose upon
such Issuing Bank any unreimbursed loss, cost or expense that was not applicable on the Closing Date and that such Issuing Bank in good faith deems material to it; or
(B) the issuance of such Letter of Credit would violate one or more policies of such Issuing Bank applicable to letters of
credit generally.
(c)
Expiration Date
. Each Letter of Credit shall expire at or prior to the close of business on the earlier of
(i) the date that is twelve (12) months (or such longer period of time as agreed by the applicable Issuing Bank) after the date of the issuance of such Letter of Credit (or, in the case of any renewal or extension thereof, twelve
(12) months (or such longer period of time as agreed by the applicable Issuing Bank) after such renewal or extension) and (ii) the Revolving Maturity Date (except to the extent cash collateralized or backstopped pursuant to arrangements
reasonably acceptable to the applicable Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent). Any Letter of Credit may provide for automatic extension or renewal thereof for an additional period of up to twelve (12) months (or such longer period of time
as agreed by the applicable Issuing Bank) (but in no event shall such period renew or extend beyond the date referred to in clause (ii) in the immediately preceding sentence (except to the extent cash collateralized or backstopped pursuant to
arrangements reasonably acceptable to the applicable Issuing Bank and the Administrative Agent)).
93
(d)
Participations
. By the issuance of a Letter of Credit (or an amendment to a
Letter of Credit increasing the amount thereof) and without any further action on the part of the applicable Issuing Bank or the Lenders, the applicable Issuing Bank hereby grants to each Revolving Lender, and each Revolving Lender hereby acquires
from the applicable Issuing Bank, a participation in any such Letter of Credit equal to such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under any such Letter of Credit. In consideration and in furtherance of
the foregoing, each Revolving Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, such Revolving Lender’s Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement made by
the applicable Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the Borrower on the date due as provided in Section 2.05(e), or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Borrower for any reason. Each Revolving Lender acknowledges and agrees
that its obligation to assume and acquire participations pursuant to this clause (d) in respect of Letters of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or
extension of any Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or an Event of Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any offset, abatement, withholding or reduction
whatsoever.
(e)
Reimbursement
. If the applicable Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement in respect of a Letter of Credit, the
Borrower shall reimburse such LC Disbursement by paying to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to such LC Disbursement not later than one (1) Business Day following the Borrower’s receipt of written notice of such LC Disbursement;
provided
that, if such LC Disbursement is not less than $100,000, the Borrower may, subject to the conditions to borrowing set forth herein, request (and, if the Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due, the Borrower shall be
deemed to have requested) in accordance with Section 2.03 or 2.04 that such LC Disbursement be financed with an ABR Revolving Borrowing or a Swingline Loan in an equivalent amount and, to the extent so financed, the Borrower’s obligation
to make such payment shall be discharged and replaced by the resulting ABR Revolving Borrowing or Swingline Loan (and the time for reimbursement of such LC Disbursement shall automatically be extended to the Business Day following such request or
deemed request). If the Borrower fails to make such payment when due, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Revolving Lender of the applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Borrower in respect thereof and such Revolving
Lender’s Applicable Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Revolving Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Applicable Percentage of the payment then due from the Borrower, in the same manner as provided
in Section 2.06 with respect to Loans made by such Revolving Lender (and Section 2.06 shall apply,
mutatis mutandis
, to the payment obligations of the Revolving Lenders), and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the
applicable Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Revolving Lenders. Promptly following receipt by the Administrative Agent of any payment from the Borrower pursuant to this clause (e), the Administrative Agent shall distribute
such payment to the applicable Issuing Bank or, to the extent that Revolving Lenders have made payments pursuant to this clause (e) to reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank, then to such Revolving Lenders and the Issuing Bank as their interests
may appear. Any payment made by a Revolving Lender pursuant to this clause (e) to reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank for any LC Disbursement (other than the funding of ABR Revolving Loans or a Swingline Loan as contemplated above) shall not
constitute a Loan and shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such LC Disbursement.
94
(f)
Obligations Absolute
. The Borrower’s obligation to reimburse LC
Disbursements as provided in Section 2.05(e) shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable, and shall be performed strictly in accordance with the terms of this Agreement under any and all circumstances whatsoever and irrespective of
(i) any lack of validity or enforceability of any Letter of Credit or this Agreement, or any term or provision therein, (ii) any draft or other document presented under a Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent or invalid in any
respect or any statement therein being untrue or inaccurate in any respect, (iii) payment by the applicable Issuing Bank under a Letter of Credit against presentation of a draft or other document that does not comply with the terms of such
Letter of Credit, or (iv) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section 2.05, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right
of setoff against, the Borrower’s obligations hereunder, in each case, other than a defense of payment in full of the Obligations. None of the Issuing Banks nor any of their Related Parties shall have any liability or responsibility by reason
of or in connection with any of the circumstances referred to in clauses (i) through (iv) in the preceding sentence;
provided
that the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing Banks and their Related Parties from
liability to the Borrower to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential or punitive damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Borrower that are
caused by any such Issuing Bank’s or its Related Parties’ gross negligence or willful misconduct (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction). In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof,
the parties agree that, with respect to documents presented that appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of a Letter of Credit, the applicable Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon
such documents without responsibility for further investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary, or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict compliance with the terms of such
Letter of Credit.
(g)
Disbursement Procedures
. The applicable Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine
all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under a Letter of Credit. The Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Borrower in writing of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has made or will
make an LC Disbursement thereunder;
provided
that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Borrower of its obligation to reimburse such Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.
(h)
Interim Interest
. If the applicable Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the Borrower shall reimburse
such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Borrower reimburses such
LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then-applicable to ABR Revolving Loans;
provided
that, if the Borrower fails to reimburse such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to Section 2.05(e) (including by way of a deemed Borrowing), then
Section 2.13(d) shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this clause (h) shall be for the account of the applicable Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Revolving Lender pursuant to
Section 2.05(e) by way of a deemed Borrowing to reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Revolving Lender to the extent of such payment.
95
(i)
Replacement of Issuing Banks
. (i) Any Issuing Bank may be replaced at any
time by written agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the successor Issuing Bank. The Administrative Agent shall notify the Lenders of any such replacement of an Issuing Bank. At the time any such replacement shall become
effective, the Borrower shall pay all unpaid fees accrued for the account of the replaced Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.12(b). From and after the effective date of any such replacement, (x) the successor Issuing Bank shall have all
the rights and obligations of its predecessor Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit to be issued thereafter and (y) references herein to the term “Issuing Bank” shall be deemed to refer to such
successor or to any previous Issuing Bank, or to such successor and all previous Issuing Banks, as the context shall require. After the replacement of an Issuing Bank hereunder, the replaced Issuing Bank shall remain a party hereto and shall
continue to have all the rights and obligations of an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with respect to Letters of Credit issued by it prior to such replacement, but shall not be required to issue additional Letters of Credit.
(ii) Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Issuing Bank, any Issuing Bank that assigns all of its Revolving
Commitments to an assignee in accordance with this Agreement may resign as an Issuing Bank at any time upon thirty days’ prior written notice to the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and the Lenders, in which case, such resigning Issuing Bank
shall be replaced in accordance with Section 2.05(i)(i) above.
(j)
Cash Collateralization
. If any Event of Default shall
occur and be continuing, on the Business Day that the Borrower receives written notice from the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders (or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated, the Required Revolving Lenders) demanding the
deposit of cash collateral pursuant to this clause (j), the Borrower shall deposit in an account with the Collateral Agent, in the name of the Collateral Agent and for the benefit of the Lenders, an amount in cash equal to 103 % the L/C
Exposure as of such date
plus
any accrued and unpaid fees thereon;
provided
that the obligation to deposit such cash collateral shall become effective immediately, and such deposit shall become immediately due and payable, without
demand or other notice of any kind, upon the occurrence of any Event of Default with respect to the Borrower described in Section 7.01(g) or Section 7.01(h). The Borrower also shall deposit cash collateral pursuant to this clause (j)
as and to the extent required by Section 2.11(b) and Section 2.22. Each such deposit shall be held by the Collateral Agent as collateral for the payment and performance of the obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. The
Collateral Agent shall have exclusive dominion and control, including the exclusive right of withdrawal, over such account. Interest, if any, on such deposits shall accumulate in such account. Moneys in such account shall be applied by the
Administrative Agent to reimburse the applicable Issuing Bank for LC Disbursements for which it has not been reimbursed and, to the extent not so applied, shall be held for the satisfaction of the reimbursement obligations of the Borrower for the
L/C Exposure at such time or, if the maturity of the Loans has been accelerated (but subject to the consent of the Required Revolving Lenders), be applied to satisfy other obligations of the Borrower under this Agreement. If the Borrower is required
to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default, such amount (to the extent not applied as aforesaid) shall be returned to the Borrower within three (3) Business Days of the written request
from the Borrower after all Events of Default have been cured or waived. If the Borrower is required to provide an amount of cash collateral hereunder as
96
a result of the occurrence of any other event, such amount (to the extent not applied in respect of the corresponding obligation) shall be returned to the Borrower within three (3) Business
Days of the written request from the Borrower after the underlying occurrence and corresponding obligation no longer exist. In addition to the foregoing, if the Collateral Agent determines in good faith that there exists excess cash collateral, such
excess cash collateral shall be promptly returned to the Borrower absent a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Borrower described in Section 7.01(g) or Section 7.01(h).
(k)
Additional Issuing Banks
. The Borrower may at any time, and from time to time, designate one or more additional Lenders to act as
an Issuing Bank under this Agreement with the consent of the Administrative Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and such Lender. Any Lender designated as an Issuing Bank pursuant to this
Section 2.05(k) shall be deemed to be, and shall have all the rights and obligations of, an “Issuing Bank” hereunder.
(l)
Provisions Related to Extended Revolving Credit Commitments
. If the Maturity Date in respect of any tranche of Revolving Credit
Commitments occurs prior to the expiration of any Letter of Credit, then (i) if one or more other tranches of Revolving Credit Commitments in respect of which the Maturity Date shall not have occurred are then in effect, so long as the
applicable Issuing Bank is a Revolving Lender under such
non-terminating
tranche and the L/C Exposure of such Issuing Bank does not exceed the amount of such Issuing Bank’s Revolving Commitment under
such
non-terminating
tranche, such Letters of Credit shall automatically be deemed to have been issued (including for purposes of the obligations of the Revolving Lenders to purchase participations therein and
to make Revolving Loans and payments in respect thereof) under (and ratably participated in by Lenders pursuant to) the Revolving Credit Commitments in respect of such
non-terminating
tranches up to an
aggregate amount not to exceed the aggregate principal amount of the unused Revolving Credit Commitments thereunder at such time (it being understood that no partial face amount of any Letter of Credit may be so reallocated) and to the extent any
Letters of Credit are not able to be reallocated pursuant to this Section 2.05(l) and there are outstanding Revolving Loans under the
non-terminating
tranches, the Borrower agrees to repay all such
Revolving Loans (or such lesser amount as is necessary to reallocate all Letters of Credit pursuant to this Section 2.05(l)) or (ii) to the extent not reallocated pursuant to the immediately preceding clause (i), the Borrower shall
cash collateralize any such Letter of Credit in accordance with Section 2.05(j) above but only up to the amount of such Letter of Credit not so reallocated. Except to the extent of reallocations of participations pursuant to clause (i) of
the immediately preceding sentence, the occurrence of a Maturity Date with respect to a given tranche of Revolving Credit Commitments shall have no effect upon (and shall not diminish) the percentage participations of the Revolving Lenders in any
Letter of Credit issued before such Maturity Date.
SECTION 2.06
Funding of Borrowings
.
(a) Each Lender shall make each Loan to be made by it hereunder on the proposed date thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds
by 12:00 p.m., New York City time (or, in the case of any requested
same-day
ABR Borrowing, 3:00 p.m., New York City time) to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by it
for such purpose by notice to the Lenders;
provided
that Swingline Loans shall be made as provided in Section 2.04.
97
The Administrative Agent will make such Loans available to the Borrower by promptly crediting the amounts so received in like funds, to an account of the Borrower maintained with the
Administrative Agent in New York City and designated by the Borrower in the applicable Borrowing Request (or as otherwise provided in the applicable Borrowing Request);
provided
that ABR Revolving Loans made to finance the reimbursement of an
LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.05(e) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the applicable Issuing Bank.
(b)
Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may
assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with Section 2.06(a) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact
made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for
each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined
by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation or (ii) in the case of the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then
such amount shall constitute such Lender’s Loan included in such Borrowing. If the Borrower and such Lender pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to
the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make its share of any Borrowing
available to the Administrative Agent.
SECTION 2.07
Interest Elections
.
(a) Each Revolving Borrowing and each Term Loan Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in
the case of a SOFR Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request or as designated by Section 2.03. Thereafter, the Borrower may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such
Borrowing and, in the case of a SOFR Borrowing, may elect Interest Periods therefor, all as provided in this Section 2.07. The Borrower may elect different options with respect to different portions of the subject Borrowing, in which case each
such portion shall be allocated ratably among the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing. This Section 2.07 shall not apply to Swingline Loans,
which may not be converted or continued.
(b) To make an election pursuant to this Section 2.07, the Borrower shall notify the
Administrative Agent of such election in writing by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Borrower were requesting a Term Loan Borrowing or a Revolving Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election
to be made on the effective date of such election (or, in each case, with such shorter period of advance notice as the Administrative Agent may agree in its reasonable discretion). Each such Interest Election Request shall be signed by the Borrower.
98
(c) Each written Interest Election Request shall specify the following information in
compliance with Section 2.02:
(i) the Borrowing to which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different
options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be
specified for each resulting Borrowing),
(ii) the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election
Request, which shall be a Business Day,
(iii) whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR Borrowing or a SOFR
Borrowing, and
(iv) if the resulting Borrowing is a SOFR Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after
giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term “Interest Period”.
If any
such Interest Election Request requests a SOFR Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Borrower shall be deemed to have selected an Interest Period of one (1) month’s duration.
(d) Promptly following receipt of an Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and
of such Lender’s portion of each resulting Borrowing.
(e) If the Borrower fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with
respect to a SOFR Borrowing prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to a SOFR Borrowing with an
Interest Period of one month’s duration.
(f) Notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and
is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Borrower, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing, no outstanding Borrowing may be converted to or continued as a SOFR Borrowing in excess
of one (1) month.
SECTION 2.08
Termination and Reduction of Commitments
.
(a) Unless previously terminated, (i) the Revolving Commitments shall terminate on the Revolving Maturity Date and (ii) the Initial
Term Loan Commitments shall terminate upon the funding of the Initial Term Loans on the Closing Date.
(b) The Borrower may at any time
terminate, or from time to time reduce, the Commitments of any Class;
provided
that (i) each reduction of the Commitments of any Class shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $100,000 and not less than $100,000 (unless
such amount is the entire remaining amount of the Commitments of such Class), and (ii) the Borrower shall not terminate or reduce the Revolving Commitments if, after giving effect to any
99
concurrent prepayment of the Revolving Loans and Swingline Loans and/or cash collateralization of outstanding Letters of Credit in a manner reasonably satisfactory to the applicable Issuing Bank
and the Administrative Agent and in a face amount equal to 103 % of the outstanding amount of the applicable L/C Exposure in respect thereof, the aggregate Revolving Exposures would exceed the aggregate Revolving Commitments.

least three (3) U.S. Government Securities Business Days prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction (or such shorter period as the Administrative Agent may agree in its reasonable discretion), specifying such election and the
effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any such notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each notice delivered by the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.08 shall be irrevocable;
provided
that a notice of termination or reduction of the Revolving Commitments delivered by the Borrower may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, or the closing of a refinancing
transaction, a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, a Change of Control, or other transaction in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower (by notice to the Administrative Agent) on or
prior to the specified effective date if such condition is not satisfied. Any termination or reduction of the Commitments of any Class shall be permanent. Except as otherwise provided herein, each reduction of the Commitments of any

Section 2.11(a) shall be applied to prepay the scheduled installments of principal on the Term Loans (pro rata between Initial Term Loans and Incremental Term Loans, if any (unless otherwise specified in the Additional Credit Extension
Amendment governing such Incremental Term Loan) based on the outstanding principal balance of such Term Loans as of the date of prepayment) as directed by the Borrower (and if not so directed, in direct order of maturity).
(b)
Excess Revolving Credit Exposure
. In the event and on such occasion that the Total Revolving Credit Exposure exceeds the aggregate
Revolving Commitments, the Borrower shall prepay Revolving Borrowings or Swingline Loans (or, if no such Borrowings are outstanding, deposit cash collateral in an account with the Collateral Agent pursuant to Section 2.05(j)) within one
(1) Business Day of written notice from the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount equal to such excess.
(c)
Excess Cash

(together with the Compliance Certificate required to be delivered pursuant to Section 5.01(d)) (each such date, an “
ECF Payment Date
”), the Borrower shall prepay (or cause to be prepaid) outstanding Term Loans, in
accordance with Section 2.11(f), in an aggregate principal amount equal to, if positive, (i) the Applicable ECF Percentage (which shall be recalculated pursuant to this clause (c)) of the amount of Excess Cash Flow for such fiscal
year minus (ii) the aggregate sum of the following (collectively, the “
ECF Deductions
”): (A) voluntary prepayments of (x) Term Loans (including any Permitted Incremental Equivalent Debt secured by a Lien on the

reduction and (z) any other Indebtedness secured on a
pari passu
basis with, or senior basis to, the Lien on the Collateral securing the Initial Term Loans,
plus
(B) purchases of Term Loans made pursuant to
Section 9.04(d) (or of (x) Permitted Incremental Equivalent Debt secured by a Lien on the Collateral on a
pari passu
basis with, or senior basis to, the Lien on the Collateral securing the Initial Term Loans or (y) any other
Indebtedness secured by a Lien on the Collateral on a
pari passu
basis with, or senior basis to, the Lien on the Collateral securing the Initial Term Loans prior to such time) in an amount equal to the face value of any such Indebtedness
purchased by the Borrower or any other Subsidiary of the Borrower pursuant to such Section 9.04(d) (or pursuant to the documentation governing such Permitted Incremental Equivalent Debt or other Indebtedness), plus (C) at the election of

being understood that to the extent such expenditure is not actually made as committed in a subsequent period, such amount
102
shall be added back in calculating Excess Cash Flow for such subsequent period);
provided
that with respect to any ECF Deductions, such amounts (x) shall be made during such fiscal
year or, at the option of the Borrower, on or prior to the applicable ECF Payment Date (without counting such amounts to reduce the amount of prepayments required by this Section 2.11(c) with respect to the subsequent fiscal year) and
(y) shall not be funded with the proceeds of long-term Indebtedness (other than revolving Indebtedness, including Revolving Loans). The ECF Deductions shall reduce on a
dollar-for-dollar
basis the amount otherwise required to be prepaid pursuant to Section 2.11(c) (such amount required to be prepaid each fiscal year,
the “
ECF Payment Amount
”) without duplication of, but in lieu of, any deductions for such amounts from the definition of “Excess Cash Flow”;
provided
that to the extent the voluntary prepayments, purchases
and expenditures pursuant to the ECF Deductions would reduce the required prepayments with respect to any fiscal year to an amount less than $0, such excess voluntary prepayments, purchases and expenditures may be credited against the ECF Payment
Amount for the next two (2) fiscal years in which the required prepayments under this Section 2.11(c) exceed $0 until such excess amount has been fully applied; provided, further, that the First Lien Net Leverage Ratio shall be
recalculated to give Pro Forma Effect to any amount referred to in the ECF Deductions after the end of the applicable fiscal year but on or prior to the applicable ECF Payment Date as if such deductions were made during the fiscal year of the
applicable Excess Cash Flow prepayment and the Applicable ECF Percentage for purposes of making such Excess Cash Flow prepayment shall be determined by reference to such recalculated First Lien Net Leverage Ratio; provided, further, that no
prepayment with Excess Cash Flow shall be required if the ECF Payment Amount for the applicable period is not greater than the greater of (x) $3,000,000 and (y) 15.0% of TTM Consolidated EBITDA (and the required prepayment amount shall be
the amount of such ECF Payment Amount in excess of such threshold, if any).
(d)
Asset Sale / Casualty Event Proceeds

and on each occasion that any Net Proceeds are received by the Borrower or any other Restricted Subsidiary in respect of any Prepayment Event, the Borrower shall, promptly after such Net Proceeds are received by the Borrower or such Restricted
Subsidiary (and in any event not later than the tenth (10
th
) Business Day after such Net Proceeds are received), prepay (or cause to be prepaid) outstanding Term Loans, in accordance with
Section 2.11(f), in an amount equal to the Applicable Net Proceeds Percentage of such Net Proceeds;
provided
that the portion of Net Proceeds required by the terms of any
pari passu
Indebtedness to be applied to prepay such
pari passu
Indebtedness on a pro rata basis with the Term Loans (and so long as the Term Lenders are offered a ratable share of such Net Proceeds) shall be credited against Net Proceeds prepayment obligations hereunder on a
dollar-for-dollar
basis;
provided
,
further
, that the Borrower and the other Restricted Subsidiaries may instead reinvest an amount equal to the Net Proceeds from
such event (or a portion thereof) within twelve (12) months after receipt of such Net Proceeds in the business of the Borrower and the other Restricted Subsidiaries, including to finance Permitted Acquisitions, other permitted Investments,
capital expenditures or purchases of inventory (or, at the election of the Borrower, credit such Net Proceeds against amounts paid in respect of any such purpose consummated no more than 150 days prior to the receipt of such Net Proceeds to the
extent such expenditure was not financed with the proceeds of long-term Indebtedness (other than revolving Indebtedness, including Revolving Loans)), and no prepayment shall be required pursuant to this Section 2.11(d) in respect of an amount
equal to such Net Proceeds so applied or credited, except to the extent of an amount equal to any such Net Proceeds therefrom that have not been so applied, credited or contractually committed in writing by the end of such twelve (12)-month period
(and, if so contractually committed in writing but not applied prior to the end of such twelve (12)-month period, applied within 180 days of the end of such period), promptly after which time a prepayment shall be required in an amount equal to such
Net Proceeds that have not been so applied.
103
(e)
Non-Permitted
Debt Issuance Proceeds

later than ten (10) Business Days following the receipt of any Net Proceeds by the Borrower or any other Restricted Subsidiary of any Indebtedness after the Closing Date (other than Indebtedness permitted by Section 6.01 to the extent not
constituting Refinancing Indebtedness or Replacement Term Loans in respect of any Class of Loans hereunder), the Borrower shall prepay (or cause to be prepaid) outstanding Term Loans, in accordance with Section 2.11(f), in an aggregate
principal amount equal to 100% of such Net Proceeds.
(f)
Application of Prepayments
. All prepayments of the Loans required under
Section 2.11(c), (d) and (e) shall be applied to prepay the scheduled installments of principal on the Term Loans (pro rata between the Initial Term Loans and Incremental Term Loans, if any (unless otherwise specified in the Additional
Credit Extension Amendment governing such Incremental Term Loan), based on the outstanding principal balance of such Term Loans as of the date of prepayment) as directed by the Borrower (and if not so directed, in direct order of maturity) and, in
each case, without premium or penalty. Prior to any optional or mandatory prepayment of Borrowings hereunder, the Borrower shall determine, in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.11, the Borrowing or Borrowings of each
applicable Class to be prepaid and shall specify such determination in the notice of such prepayment pursuant to Section 2.11(g).
(g)
Prepayment Notice
. The Borrower shall notify the Administrative Agent (and, in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, the
Swingline Lender) in writing of any prepayment hereunder (i) in the case of prepayment of a SOFR Borrowing, not later than 12:00 p.m., New York City time, three (3) U.S. Government Securities Business Days before the date of prepayment (or
with such shorter period of advance notice as may be agreed by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion), (ii) in the case of prepayment of an ABR Borrowing, not later than 12:00 p.m., New York City time, one (1) Business
Day before the date of prepayment (or with such shorter period of advance notice as may be agreed by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion) or (iii) in the case of prepayment of a Swingline Loan, not later than 2:00 p.m.,
New York City time, on the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify the estimated prepayment date, the principal amount of each Borrowing or portion thereof to be prepaid, the Class of Loans to be prepaid and,
in the case of a mandatory prepayment, a reasonably detailed calculation of the estimated amount of such prepayment;
provided
that (i) if a notice of optional prepayment is given in connection with a conditional notice of termination of
the Commitments as contemplated by Section 2.08, then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such notice of termination is revoked in accordance with Section 2.08 and (ii) otherwise, if a notice of prepayment is given under this
Section 2.11, such notice of prepayment may be conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities, or the closing of a refinancing transaction, a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, a
Change of Control or other transaction, then such notice of prepayment may be revoked if such condition is not satisfied. Promptly following receipt of any such notice (other than a notice relating solely to Swingline Loans), the Administrative
Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Borrowing of the same Type as provided in
104
Section 2.02, except as necessary to apply fully the required amount of a mandatory prepayment and except to the extent that such prepayment amount represents the entire remaining amount
outstanding of a given Class of Loans. Each prepayment of a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans of each applicable Lender included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required
by Section 2.13 but shall in no event include premium or penalty;
provided
that in the event that the notice required by this Section 2.11(g) is not made within the required times with respect to any mandatory prepayments, such
prepayment shall nevertheless be required to be made within the times set forth for such prepayment herein.
(h) Each Term Lender may
reject all or a portion of its pro rata share of any mandatory prepayment (such declined amounts, the “
Declined Proceeds
”) of Term Loans required to be made pursuant to Section 2.11(c), (d) or (e) (except in respect of
mandatory prepayments made pursuant to Section 2.11(e) in respect of Refinancing Indebtedness or Replacement Term Loans that are being used to refinance any Class of Loans hereunder) by providing written notice (each,
a “
Rejection Notice
”) to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower no later than 5:00 p.m. one (1) Business Day after the date of such Lender’s receipt of notice from the Administrative Agent regarding such
prepayment. Each Rejection Notice from a given Lender shall specify the principal amount of the mandatory repayment of Term Loans to be rejected by such Lender. If a Lender of Term Loans fails to deliver a Rejection Notice to the Administrative
Agent within the time frame specified above or such Rejection Notice fails to specify the principal amount of the Term Loans to be rejected, any such failure will be deemed an acceptance of the total amount of such mandatory prepayment of its Term
Loans. Any Declined Proceeds shall be retained by the Borrower (such remaining Declined Proceeds, the “
Borrower Retained Prepayment Amounts
”).
(i) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section 2.11, (i) to the extent that any of or all the Net Proceeds of any
disposition by a Foreign Subsidiary (“
Foreign Disposition
”) or the Net Proceeds of any casualty event from a Foreign Subsidiary (a “
Foreign Casualty Event
”), or any or all of the Excess Cash Flow
attributable to a Foreign Subsidiary, or, in each case, distributions of cash or Permitted Investments in connection with such events, are prohibited or restricted by (x) applicable law, rule or regulation, (y) other material contracts and
agreements or (z) material constituent document restrictions (including as a result of minority ownership) from being repatriated to the United States, the portion of such Net Proceeds or Excess Cash Flow, as applicable, so affected will not be
required to be applied to repay Loans at the times provided in this Section 2.11 and none of the Loan Parties or any of their Subsidiaries shall be required to monitor any such payment block and/or reserve cash or Permitted Investments for
future repatriation after it has notified the Administrative Agent of the existence of such payment block;
provided
that (I) the Borrower shall use commercially reasonable efforts (as determined by the Borrower acting in good faith) to
overcome such payment block for a period of time not to exceed twelve (12) months after the receipt of the applicable Net Proceeds and (II) in the event that, and to the extent that, within such twelve (12) month period, such payment
block no longer applies, then such prepayment shall be effected promptly (and in any event not later than ten (10) Business Days) after such payment block ceases to apply (net of additional taxes payable or reserved against as a result thereof
to the extent not already taken into account under the definition of “Net Proceeds”) pursuant to this Section 2.11 to the extent provided herein and (ii) to the extent that the repatriation of any of or all the Net Proceeds of
any Foreign Disposition or any Foreign Casualty Event could result in adverse tax consequences (other than
de minimis
adverse tax consequences, as reasonably determined by the Borrower), the portion of such Net Proceeds so
105
affected will not be required to be applied to repay Loans at the times provided in this Section 2.11 and none of the Loan Parties or any of their Subsidiaries shall be required to monitor
any such payment block and/or reserve cash or Permitted Investments for future repatriation after it has notified the Administrative Agent of the existence of such payment block.
SECTION 2.12
Fees

within fifteen (15) days after the last Business Day of March, June, September and December of each year commencing with the first such date to occur after the first full fiscal quarter of the Borrower ending after the Closing Date and on the
date on which such Revolving Commitments terminate. All commitment fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). For
purposes of computing commitment fees with respect to Revolving Commitments, a Revolving Commitment of a Lender shall be deemed to be used to the extent of the outstanding Revolving Loans and L/C Exposure of such Lender (and the Swingline Exposure
of such Lender shall be disregarded for such purpose).
(b) The Borrower agrees to pay (i) to the Administrative Agent for the
account of each Revolving Lender a participation fee with respect to its participations in Letters of Credit, which shall accrue at the same Applicable Rate used to determine the interest rate applicable to SOFR Revolving Loans (as such Applicable
Rate may be increased pursuant to Section 2.13(d)) on the average daily amount of such Lender’s L/C Exposure (excluding any portion thereof attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the date of
issuance of any Letter of Credit to but excluding the later of the date on which such Lender’s Revolving Commitment terminates and the date on which such Lender ceases to have any L/C Exposure, and (ii) to the applicable Issuing Bank a
fronting fee, which shall accrue at a rate equal to 0.125% per annum (or such lesser amount as may be agreed to by the Borrower and the applicable Issuing Bank) on the average daily amount of the L/C Exposure (excluding any portion thereof
attributable to unreimbursed LC Disbursements) during the period from and including the Closing Date to but excluding the later of the date of termination of the Revolving Commitments and the date on which there ceases to be any L/C Exposure, as
well as the applicable Issuing Bank’s standard and customary fees with respect to the issuance, amendment, renewal or extension of any Letter of Credit or processing of drawings thereunder. Participation fees and fronting fees shall be payable
in arrears within fifteen (15) days after the last Business Day of March, June, September and December of each year, commencing with the first such date to occur after the first full fiscal quarter of the Borrower ending after the Closing Date;
provided
that all such fees shall be payable on the date on which the Revolving Commitments terminate and any such fees accruing after the date on which the Revolving Commitments terminate shall be payable promptly following written demand
therefor. Any other fees payable to the Issuing Bank pursuant to this clause (b) shall be payable within fifteen (15) Business Days after written demand. All participation fees and fronting fees shall be computed on the basis of a year of
360 days and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day).
106
(c) The Borrower agrees to pay to the applicable recipient the fees in the amount and at the
times separately agreed upon in the Fee Letter.
(d) If the Borrower or any of its Affiliates repays or prepays the Loans in any amount
and for any reason, no prepayment premium shall apply.
(e) All fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately
available funds, to the Administrative Agent (or to the applicable Issuing Bank, in the case of fees payable to it) for distribution, in the case of commitment fees and participation fees (in each case, if any), to the Lenders entitled thereto. Fees
paid shall not be refundable under any circumstances unless otherwise agreed in writing by the applicable parties.
SECTION 2.13
Interest
.
(a) The Loans comprising each ABR Borrowing (including each Swingline Loan denominated in dollars, unless otherwise
agreed by the Borrower and the Swingline Lender) shall bear interest at the Alternate Base Rate
plus
the Applicable Rate.
(b) With
respect to SOFR Borrowings in dollars, the Loans comprising each SOFR Borrowing shall bear interest at Term SOFR for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing
plus
the Applicable Rate.
(c) In connection with the use or administration of Term SOFR, the Administrative Agent may (with the consent of Borrower, such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed;
provided
that the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to such Conforming Changes unless it shall have objected thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within ten
(10) Business Days after having received written notice thereof) make Conforming Changes in accordance with Section 2.14(c)(ii) from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any
amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders
of the effectiveness of any Conforming Changes in connection with the use or administration of Term SOFR.
(d) Notwithstanding the
foregoing, following written demand by the Required Lenders upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default under Section 7.01(a) or (b), the Borrower shall (i) pay interest on overdue principal hereunder at a
fluctuating interest rate at all times equal to 2.00% per annum over the applicable interest rate and (ii) pay interest on any other overdue amount (including overdue interest) hereunder at a fluctuating interest rate at all times equal to
2.00% per annum over the interest rate applicable to ABR Loans (but not with respect to any commitment fee set forth therein), in each case, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.
(e) Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan and, in the case of Revolving Loans,
upon termination of the Revolving Commitments;
provided
that (i) interest accrued pursuant to Section 2.13(d) shall be payable following written demand therefor, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan
(other than a prepayment of an ABR Revolving Loan prior to the end of the Revolving Availability Period), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment and (iii) in the
event of any conversion of any SOFR Loan prior to the end of the current Interest Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion.
107
(f) All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year of 360 days, except
that interest computed by reference to the Alternate Base Rate at times when the Alternate Base Rate is based on the Prime Rate shall be computed on the basis of a year of 365 days (or 366 days in a leap year) or, in the case of interest
in respect of Loans denominated in Alternative Currencies as to which generally accepted market practice differs from the foregoing as reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent, in accordance with such generally accepted market practice, and
in each case shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed (including the first day but excluding the last day). Interest on each Loan shall be payable in the currency in which such Loan was made. The applicable Alternate Base Rate or Term
SOFR shall be determined by the Administrative Agent, and such determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Administrative Agent shall, at the request of the Borrower, promptly deliver to the Borrower a statement showing the
quotations used by the Administrative Agent in determining any interest rate hereunder.
SECTION 2.14
Changed Circumstances
.
(a)
Circumstances Affecting Benchmark Availability
. Subject to Section 2.14(c), in connection with any request for a SOFR Loan or
a conversion to or continuation thereof or otherwise, if for any reason (i) the Administrative Agent shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and binding absent manifest error) that reasonable and adequate means do not exist for
ascertaining Term SOFR for the applicable Interest Period with respect to a proposed SOFR Loan on or prior to the first day of such Interest Period or (ii) the Required Lenders shall determine (which determination shall be conclusive and
binding absent manifest error) that Term SOFR does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining such Loans during such Interest Period and, in the case of clause (ii), the Required Lenders have provided
notice in writing of such determination to the Administrative Agent, then, in each case, the Administrative Agent shall promptly give written notice thereof to the Borrower (it being understood and agreed, however, that any outstanding Term Loans
and unused Commitments of a Lender that is not making such determination with respect to loans to borrowers (similarly situated to the Borrower hereunder), or providing such notice to borrowers (similarly situated to the Borrower hereunder), under
comparable syndicated credit facilities similar to the credit facilities under this Agreement, shall not be included in the calculation of Required Lenders for the purposes of this Section 2.14(a)). Upon written notice thereof by the
Administrative Agent to the Borrower, any obligation of the Lenders to make SOFR Loans, and any right of the Borrower to convert any Loan to or continue any Loan as a SOFR Loan, shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected SOFR Loans or the
affected Interest Periods) until the Administrative Agent (with respect to clause (ii), at the instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice. Upon receipt of such notice, (A) the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a
borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of SOFR Loans (to the extent of the affected SOFR Loans or the affected Interest Periods) or, failing that, the Borrower will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request for a borrowing of
or conversion to ABR Loans in the amount specified therein and (B) any outstanding affected SOFR Loans will be deemed to have been converted into ABR Loans at the end of the applicable Interest Period. Upon any such prepayment or conversion,
the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.
108
(b)
Laws Affecting SOFR Availability
. If, after the date hereof, the introduction of,
or any change in, any applicable law or any change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any of
the Lenders (or any of their respective lending offices) with any request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) of any such Governmental Authority, central bank or comparable agency, shall make it unlawful or impossible for any of
the Lenders (or any of their respective lending offices) to honor its obligations hereunder to make or maintain any SOFR Loan, or to determine or charge interest based upon SOFR, the Term SOFR Reference Rate or Term SOFR, such Lender shall promptly
give notice thereof to the Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent shall promptly give notice to the Borrower and the other Lenders (an “
Illegality Notice
”). Thereafter, until each affected Lender notifies the
Administrative Agent and the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist with respect to such Lender, (i) any obligation of the affected Lender to make SOFR Loans, and any
right of the Borrower to convert any portion of a Loan held by such Lender to a SOFR Loan or continue any portion of a Loan held by such Lender as a SOFR Loan shall be suspended and thereafter the Borrower may select only ABR Loans with respect to
any portion of Loans held by such Lender and (ii) if necessary to avoid such illegality, the Administrative Agent shall compute the Alternate Base Rate without reference to clause (c) of the definition of “Alternate Base Rate”.
Upon receipt of an Illegality Notice, the Borrower shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, upon demand from any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all affected SOFR Loans of such Lender to ABR
Loans (in each case, if necessary to avoid such illegality, the Administrative Agent shall compute the Alternate Base Rate without reference to clause (c) of the definition of “Alternate Base Rate”), on the last day of the Interest
Period therefor, if such affected Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such SOFR Loans to such day, or immediately if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such SOFR Loans to such day. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the
Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted.
(c)
Benchmark Replacement Setting
.
(i)
Benchmark Replacement
.
(A) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, if a Benchmark Transition Event and its related Benchmark
Replacement Date have occurred prior to the Reference Time in respect of any setting of the then-current Benchmark, then (x) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined in accordance with clause (1) of the definition of “Benchmark
Replacement” for such Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any other Loan Document in respect of such Benchmark setting and subsequent Benchmark settings
without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document and
109
(y) if a Benchmark Replacement is determined by the Administrative Agent and the Borrower in accordance with clause (2) of the definition of “Benchmark Replacement” for such
Benchmark Replacement Date, such Benchmark Replacement will replace such Benchmark for all purposes hereunder and under any other Loan Document in respect of any Benchmark setting at or after 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the fifth (5th)
Business Day after the date notice of such Benchmark Replacement is provided to the Lenders without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document.
(B) No Swap Agreement shall be deemed to be a “Loan Document” for purposes of this Section 2.14(c).
(ii)
Conforming Changes
. In connection with the use, administration, adoption or implementation of a Benchmark
Replacement, the Administrative Agent (with the consent of Borrower, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed;
provided
that the Borrower shall be deemed to have consented to such Conforming Changes unless it shall
have objected thereto by written notice to the Administrative Agent within ten (10) Business Days after having received written notice thereof) will have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any amendment to, or further action or consent of any other party to, this Agreement or any other Loan Document.
(iii)
Notices; Standards for Decisions and Determinations
. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the
Borrower and the Lenders of (A) the implementation of any Benchmark Replacement and (B) the effectiveness of any Conforming Changes in connection with the use, administration, adoption or implementation of a Benchmark Replacement. The
Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower of the removal or reinstatement of any tenor of a Benchmark pursuant to Section 2.14(c)(iv). Any determination, decision or election that may be made by the Administrative Agent, the
Borrower or, if applicable, any Lender (or group of Lenders) pursuant to this Section 2.14(c), including any determination with respect to a tenor, rate or adjustment or of the occurrence or
non-occurrence
of an event, circumstance or date and any decision to take or refrain from taking any action or any selection, will be conclusive and binding absent manifest error and may be made in its or
their sole discretion and without consent from any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document, except, in each case, as expressly required pursuant to this Section 2.14(c) (or pursuant to the definitions used herein).
(iv)
Unavailability of Tenor of Benchmark
. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan
Document, at any time (including in connection with the implementation of a Benchmark Replacement), (A) if the then-current Benchmark is a term rate (including the Term SOFR Reference Rate) and either (1) any tenor for such Benchmark is
not displayed on a screen or other information service that publishes such rate from time to time as selected by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable discretion
110
or (2) the regulatory supervisor for the administrator of such Benchmark has provided a public statement or publication of information announcing that any tenor for such Benchmark is not or
will not be representative, then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of “Interest Period” (or any similar or analogous definition) for any Benchmark settings at or after such time to remove such unavailable or
non-representative
tenor and (B) if a tenor that was removed pursuant to clause (A) above either (1) is subsequently displayed on a screen or information service for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark
Replacement) or (2) is not, or is no longer, subject to an announcement that it is not or will not be representative for a Benchmark (including a Benchmark Replacement), then the Administrative Agent may modify the definition of “Interest
Period” (or any similar or analogous definition) for all Benchmark settings at or after such time to reinstate such previously removed tenor.
(v)
Benchmark Unavailability Period
. Upon the Borrower’s receipt of notice of the commencement of a Benchmark
Unavailability Period, (A) the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of affected SOFR Loans to be made, converted or continued during any Benchmark Unavailability Period and, failing that, the
Borrower will be deemed to have converted any such request into a request for a borrowing of or conversion to ABR Loans and (B) any outstanding affected SOFR Loans (to the extent of the affected SOFR Loans or the affected Interest Periods) will
be deemed to have been converted to ABR Loans at the end of the applicable Interest Period. During any Benchmark Unavailability Period or at any time that a tenor for the then-current Benchmark is not an Available Tenor, the component of the
Alternate Base Rate based upon the then-current Benchmark or such tenor for such Benchmark, as applicable, will not be used in any determination of the Alternate Base Rate.
SECTION 2.15
Increased Costs
.
(a) If any Change in Law shall:
(i) impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or
for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender or any Issuing Bank,
(ii) subject any Lender or any Issuing Bank to
any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, or (B) Excluded Taxes) with respect to its loans, letters of credit, commitments or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto, or
(iii) impose on any Lender or any Issuing Bank any other condition affecting this Agreement or SOFR Loans made by such Lender
or any Letter of Credit or participation therein, and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making or maintaining any SOFR Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan) or to increase the
cost to such Lender or Issuing Bank of participating in, issuing or maintaining any Letter of Credit or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or otherwise),
then the Borrower will pay to such Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable, for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
111
(b) If any Lender or Issuing Bank reasonably determines that any Change in Law regarding
capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s or Issuing Bank’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s or Issuing Bank’s holding company, if any, as a
consequence of this Agreement or the Loans made by, or participations in Letters of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or Issuing Bank or such Lender’s or
Issuing Bank’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s or Issuing Bank’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s or Issuing Bank’s holding company with
respect to capital adequacy) (it being understood and agreed, however, that a Lender shall not be entitled to make such determination, to the extent that such Lender is not making such determination with respect to loans to borrowers (similarly
situated to the Borrower hereunder), or providing such notice to borrowers (similarly situated to the Borrower hereunder), under comparable syndicated credit facilities similar to the credit facilities under this Agreement), then from time to time
the Borrower will pay to such Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank or such Lender’s or Issuing Bank’s holding company for any such reduction suffered.
(c) A certificate of a Lender or an Issuing Bank setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or Issuing Bank
or its holding company, as applicable, as specified in Section 2.15(a) or (b) shall be delivered to the Borrower and shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable, the amount
shown as due on any such certificate within 15 days after receipt thereof.
(d) Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or Issuing Bank
to demand compensation pursuant to this Section 2.15 shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s or Issuing Bank’s right to demand such compensation;
provided
that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender
or Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section 2.15 for any increased costs or reductions incurred more than 180 days prior to the date that such Lender or Issuing Bank, as applicable, notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such
increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s or Issuing Bank’s intention to claim compensation therefor;
provided
,
further
, that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive,
then the
180-day
period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof.
SECTION 2.16
[Reserved]
.
SECTION 2.17
Taxes
.
(a)
Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except to the extent required by applicable law. If any applicable law
(as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable withholding agent) requires the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment, then (i) the applicable withholding agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or
withholding and shall pay the full amount deducted or withheld
112
to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, and (ii) to the extent such Tax is an Indemnified Tax, the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be
increased as necessary so that after all required deductions and withholdings have been made for Indemnified Taxes (including deductions or withholdings applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.17), the Lender (or, in the case
of any amount received by the Administrative Agent for its own account, the Administrative Agent) receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deduction or withholding been made.
(b) Without duplication of other amounts payable by the Borrower under this Section 2.17, the Borrower shall timely pay to the relevant
Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes.
(c) Without duplication of amounts payable by the Borrower under this Section 2.17, the Loan Parties, jointly and severally, shall
indemnify the Administrative Agent and each Lender, within thirty (30) days after written demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes payable by the Administrative Agent or such Lender (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or
asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 2.17), and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant
Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender, or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 2.17(c), the Borrower shall not be required to indemnify the Administrative Agent or any Lender pursuant to this Section 2.17(c) for any incremental interest, penalties or
expenses resulting from the failure of the Administrative Agent or such Lender to notify the Borrower of such possible indemnification claim within 180 days after the Administrative Agent or such Lender receives written notice from the
applicable taxing authority of the specific tax assessment giving rise to such indemnification claim. To the extent the Borrower reasonably believes that such Taxes were not correctly or legally asserted, upon reasonable request by the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent or such Lender, as applicable, will use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with the Borrower to obtain a refund of such Taxes (which shall be repaid to the Borrower in accordance with, and to the extent provided by,
Section 2.17(g) below) so long as such efforts would not, in the sole determination of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as applicable, result in any additional
out-of-pocket
costs or expenses not reimbursed by the Borrower or be otherwise disadvantageous to the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as applicable.
(d) As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes by a Loan Party to a Governmental Authority pursuant to this
Section 2.17, the Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, if any, a copy of the return reporting such payment or other
evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.
113
(e) (i) Any recipient that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding
Tax with respect to any payments under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by either of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and
executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate. In addition, any recipient, if reasonably
requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to
determine whether or not such recipient is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation
(other than such documentation set forth in Sections 2.17(e)(ii)(A), (ii)(B) and (ii)(C)) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material
unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender. Each recipient shall, whenever a lapse in time or change in circumstances renders such documentation (including any specific documentation
required below in this Section 2.17(e)) obsolete, expired or inaccurate in any respect, deliver promptly to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent updated or other appropriate documentation (including any new documentation reasonably
requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent) or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its ineligibility to do so.
(ii) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:
(A) each Lender that is a “United States person” within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code shall
deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or about the date on which such Lender becomes a party to this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent) two
(2) duly completed and executed copies of IRS
Form W-9,
certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding Tax,
(B) each Foreign Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or about the date on which such Foreign
Lender becomes a party to this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent) two (2) duly signed and properly completed copies of whichever of the following is applicable:
(1) IRS
Form W-8BEN
or
W-8BEN-E,
as applicable, claiming eligibility for benefits under an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party,
(2) IRS
Form W-8ECI,
(3) in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of
the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of
Exhibit
K-1
to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not (A) a “bank” within the meaning of
Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, (B) a
“10-percent
shareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 871(h)(3)(B) of the Code, or (C) a “controlled foreign
corporation” related to the Borrower, as described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code and that no payments under any Loan Document are effectively connected with such Lender’s conduct of a U.S. trade or business
(a “
U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate
”) and (y) IRS
Form W-8BEN
or
W-8BEN-E,
as applicable,
114
(4) to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner (for
example, where the Lender is a partnership or a participating Lender), executed copies of IRS
Form W-8IMY,
accompanied by IRS
Form W-8ECI,
IRS
Form W-8BEN,
IRS
Form W-8BEN-E,
a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of
Exhibit
K-2
or
Exhibit
K-3
, IRS
Form W-9,
and/or other certification documents from each beneficial
owner, as applicable;
provided
that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and not a participating Lender, and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender
may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of
Exhibit
K
-4
on behalf of such direct and indirect partner(s), or
(5) any other documentation prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal
withholding Tax duly completed together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made, and
(C) if a payment made to a Lender or the Administrative Agent under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal
withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender or the Administrative Agent were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such
Lender or the Administrative Agent shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by applicable law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such
documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower
and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine whether such Lender or the Administrative Agent has complied with such Lender’s or the Administrative Agent’s obligations under FATCA or to
determine the amount, if any, to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of Section 2.17(e)(ii)(C), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
(iii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.17(e), a Lender shall not be required to deliver any
documentation that such Lender is not legally eligible to deliver.
(iv) Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative
Agent to deliver to the Loan Parties and to any successor of such Administrative Agent any documentation provided by such Lender pursuant to this Section 2.17(e).
115
(f) On or before the date the Administrative Agent becomes a party to this Agreement, the
Administrative Agent shall provide to the Borrower, two (2) duly signed and properly completed copies of (i) IRS
Form W-9,
or (ii) IRS
Form W-8IMY
(with respect to payments received by the Administrative Agent on behalf of a Lender) certifying that it is a “U.S. branch” and that the payments it receives for the account of
others are not effectively connected with the conduct of its trade or business within the United States, evidencing its agreement with the Borrower to be treated as a “United States person” within the meaning of Section 7701(a)(30)
of the Code with respect to amounts received on account of any Lender (and its agreement with the Borrower to so treat the Administrative Agent as a United States person with respect to such payments as contemplated by
Section 1.1441-1(b)(2)(iv)
of the United States Treasury Regulations), and IRS Form
W-8ECI
(with respect to amounts received on its own account). At any time
thereafter, the Administrative Agent shall provide updated documentation previously provided (or a successor form thereto) when any documentation previously delivered has become obsolete, expired or inaccurate or otherwise upon the reasonable
request of the Borrower. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 2.17(f), an Administrative Agent shall not be required to deliver any documentation that the Administrative Agent is not legally eligible to deliver as a result of any
Change in Law occurring after the Closing Date.
(g) If the Administrative Agent or a Lender determines, in its sole discretion exercised
in good faith, that it has received a refund (whether in cash or as an offset against cash Taxes otherwise due) of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified (including by the payment of additional amounts) pursuant to this Section 2.17, it
shall pay over such refund to the Borrower (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower under this Section 2.17 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all reasonable and
documented
out-of-pocket
expenses (including Taxes) of the Administrative Agent or such Lender and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant
Governmental Authority with respect to such refund);
provided
that the Borrower, upon the request of the Administrative Agent or such Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower pursuant to this Section 2.17(g)
(
plus
any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Administrative Agent or such Lender in the event the Administrative Agent or such Lender is required to repay such refund to such
Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2.17(g), in no event will the Administrative Agent or any Lender be required to pay any amount to the Borrower or any other Loan Party pursuant to this
Section 2.17(g) to the extent that such payment would place the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as applicable, in a less favorable net
after-Tax
position than the Administrative Agent or such Lender,
as applicable, would have been in if the Tax subject to the indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never
been paid. This Section 2.17 shall not be construed to require the Administrative Agent or any Lender to make available its Tax returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other
Person.
116
(h) Each party’s obligations under this Section 2.17 shall survive the
resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document.
(i) For purposes of this Section 2.17, the term “Lender” includes the Swingline Lender and any Issuing Bank.
SECTION 2.18
Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Setoffs
.
(a) (i) Except with respect to principal of and interest on Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency, the Borrower shall make each
payment or prepayment required to be made by it hereunder or under any other Loan Document (whether of principal, interest, fees or reimbursement of LC Disbursements, or of amounts payable under Section 2.15 or 2.17, or otherwise) in dollars at
or prior to the time expressly required hereunder or under such other Loan Document for such payment (or, if no such time is expressly required, prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time), on the date when due and (ii) all payments with
respect to principal and interest on Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency shall be made in such Alternative Currency not later than the Applicable Time specified by the Administrative Agent on the date when due, in each case, in immediately
available funds, without setoff or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the reasonable discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of
calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent at its offices at 550 South Tryon St., Charlotte, NC 28202 (or such other office as from time to time the Administrative Agent shall designate by written
notice to the Borrower), except payments to be made directly to any Lender, any Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.17 and 9.03 shall be made directly to the
Persons entitled thereto and payments pursuant to other Loan Documents shall be made to the Persons specified therein. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person to the appropriate
recipient promptly following receipt thereof. Except as otherwise provided in the definition of “Interest Period”, if any payment under any Loan Document shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be
extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension. All payments under each Loan Document shall be made in dollars or, in the case of
principal and interest with respect to Loans denominated in an Alternative Currency, the applicable Alternative Currency;
provided
that, if for any reason, the Borrower is prohibited by law from making any required payment hereunder in an
Alternative Currency, the Borrower shall make such payment in dollars in the Dollar Equivalent of the Alternative Currency payment amount.
(b) If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal,
unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i)
first
, towards payment of interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the
amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii)
second
, towards payment of principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of
principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.
117
(c) If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise
except as expressly provided in this Agreement, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements or Swingline Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a greater proportion
of the aggregate amount of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash
at face value) participations in the Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the
aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans;
provided
that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment
giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this clause (c) shall not be construed to apply to
(x) any payment made by the Borrower or any Subsidiary pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or (y) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any
of its Loans or participations in LC Disbursements to any assignee or participant, including any payment made or deemed made in connection with Section 2.20, 2.21, 9.02(c) and/or 9.04. The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the
extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as
if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower in the amount of such participation. For purposes of clause (c)(i) of the definition of “Excluded Taxes,” a participation acquired pursuant to this Section 2.18(c) shall be
treated as having been acquired on the earlier date(s) on which the applicable Lender acquired the applicable interest in the Commitment(s) or Loan(s) to which such participation relates.
(d) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the
Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Banks hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may,
in reliance upon such assumption and in its good faith sole discretion, distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing Banks, as applicable, the amount due. In such event, if the Borrower has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the
Issuing Banks, as applicable, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender or Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is
distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
(e) If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.06(a), 2.18(d) or 9.03(c), then the
Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender to satisfy such Lender’s obligations under
118
such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid. If any Revolving Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to Section 2.04(c), 2.05(d) or
(e), 2.06(a), 2.18(d) or 9.03(c), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion and notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof, (i) apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Revolving
Lender and for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Swingline Lender or the applicable Issuing Bank to satisfy such Revolving Lender’s obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid, and/or
(ii) hold any such amounts in a segregated
non-interest
bearing account as cash collateral for, and application to, any future funding obligations of such Revolving Lender under such Sections, in the case
of each of clauses (i) and (ii) above, in any order as determined by the Administrative Agent in its discretion.
(f)
Notwithstanding any contrary provision set forth herein or in any other Loan Document, but subject to any applicable Intercreditor Agreement, all payments made by Loans Parties to the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent after any or all of
the Obligations under the Loan Documents have been accelerated (so long as such acceleration has not been rescinded) or have otherwise matured, including proceeds of Collateral, shall be applied as follows:
first
, to payment of costs, fees, expenses and indemnities of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent payable
or reimbursable by the Loan Parties under the Loan Documents;

SECTION 2.19
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders
.
(a) If any Lender gives a notice pursuant to Section 2.14(b), requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if any Loan Party is
required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or
booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate the need to give
a notice pursuant to Section 2.14(b), or eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.15 or 2.17, as applicable, in the future and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not
otherwise be materially disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable and documented
out-of-pocket
costs and expenses incurred by any
Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
(b) If any Lender is affected in the manner described in
Section 2.14(a) or (b) and as a result thereof any of the actions described in such Section is required to be taken, or if any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if any Loan Party is required to pay any additional
amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.17, or if any Lender defaults in its obligation to fund Loans hereunder, then the Borrower may, (x) at its sole expense and effort, upon
notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under
this Agreement to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment) or (y) terminate the Commitments of such Lender and repay all Obligations of the Borrower owing (and
the amount of all accrued interest and fees in respect thereof) to such Lender relating to the Loans and participations held by such Lender;
provided
that (i) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding
principal of its Loans and participations in LC Disbursements and Swingline Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder, from, in the case of an assignment and delegation, the assignee (to the extent
of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts), and in the case of a termination and repayment, the Borrower, and (ii) in the case of any such assignment or termination resulting
from a claim for compensation under Section 2.15 or payments required to be made pursuant to Section 2.17, such assignment or termination will result in a material reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter. A Lender shall not
be required to make any such assignment and delegation and the Borrower shall not be permitted to make any such termination and repayment if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise,
120
the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation or to make such termination and repayment cease to apply. In connection with any assignment and delegation as
described above, if the assignor Lender does not execute and deliver a duly executed Assignment and Assumption reflecting such assignment and delegation within five (5) Business Days of the date on which the assignee Lender executes and
delivers such Assignment and Assumption to the assignor Lender, then the assignor Lender shall be deemed to have executed and delivered such Assignment and Assumption without any action on the part of any other party.

Incremental Revolving Commitments
”); or (ii) prior to the Latest Maturity Date, the establishment of one or more new term loan commitments,
which may be under a new term facility, a new delayed draw term loan facility or may be part of an existing Class of Commitments in respect of Term Loans (including delayed draw term loan commitments) (“
Incremental Term
Commitments

the Incremental Revolving Loans of such Class made pursuant thereto.
(c) Each Incremental Loan Request from the Borrower pursuant to

no existing Lender will have an obligation to provide all or any portion of any Incremental Facility) or by any Additional Lender (each such existing Lender or Additional Lender providing such Commitment or Loan, an “
Incremental
Revolving Lender

121
“
Incremental Term Lender

Incremental Amendment Date
”) of each of the following conditions,

Commitments and Loans made pursuant to this Section 2.20 shall be, except as otherwise set forth herein (including Section 2.20(f)), on terms and pursuant to documentation as agreed between by the Borrower and the applicable Incremental
Lenders providing such Incremental Term Commitments, Incremental Term Loans and/or Incremental Revolving Commitments, as applicable, and, for the avoidance of doubt, no consent shall be required from the Administrative Agent (except to the extent
affecting the rights and duties of, or any fees or other amounts payable to, the Administrative Agent) or any other Secured Party;
provided
that the documentation of the Incremental Facilities consisting solely of Incremental Revolving
Commitments shall be as agreed
122
between the Borrower and the applicable Incremental Lenders providing such Incremental Facilities, and except as otherwise set forth herein, shall be consistent with the then-existing
Class of Revolving Commitments (except for covenants or other provisions that (w) reflect market terms and conditions (taken as a whole) at the time of incurrence (as determined by the Borrower in good faith), (x) are reasonably
acceptable to the Administrative Agent, (y) are more favorable than those contained in the Loan Documents and are conformed (or added) for the benefit of the existing Revolving Lenders in the Loan Documents with respect to the Revolving Credit
Facility pursuant to the related Additional Credit Extension Amendment (but without the consent of the existing Lenders and Issuing Banks) or (z) are applicable only to periods after the Revolving Maturity Date as of the Incremental Amendment
Date);
provided
,
further
, that in the case of Incremental Term Commitments or Incremental Revolving Commitments that, in each case, increase an existing Class of Term Loans or Revolving Credit Commitments, the terms, provisions
and documentation (other than the Additional Credit Extension Amendment evidencing such increase) of such Incremental Facility shall be the same (other than with respect to upfront fees, OID or similar fees, it being understood that, if required to
consummate such Incremental Facility, the interest rate margins and rate floors may be increased, any call protection provision may be made more favorable to the applicable existing Lenders and additional upfront or similar fees may be payable to
the lenders providing such Incremental Facility) as that of the Term Loans or Revolving Credit Commitments being increased, in each case, as existing on the Incremental Amendment Date (with, for the avoidance of doubt, no requirement that the
Administrative Agent (except to the extent affecting the rights and duties of, or any fees or other amounts payable to, the Administrative Agent) or any other Lender consent to or acknowledge such documentation). In connection with any Incremental
Term Loans that constitute part of the same Class as the existing Term Loans, the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall be permitted to adjust the rate of prepayment in respect of such Class such that the Term Lenders holding the
existing Term Loans comprising part of such Class continue to receive a payment that is not less than the same amount that such Term Lenders would have received absent the incurrence of such Incremental Term Loans. In any event:
(i) the Incremental Term Loans:

pari passu
in right of payment with or junior in right of payment to the Initial Term Loans,

with Refinancing Indebtedness or Replacement Term Loans)) in any mandatory prepayments of Term Loans hereunder;
provided
that, for the avoidance of doubt, any Declined Proceeds may be paid in respect of such Incremental Term Loans on a
greater than pro rata basis (or may be retained by the Borrower in its sole discretion).

Agreement),
(B) (1) shall not have a final scheduled maturity date earlier than the Revolving Maturity Date and
(2) shall not have any scheduled amortization or mandatory commitment reduction prior to the Revolving Maturity Date,

additional participations under the Additional Credit Extension Amendment, subject to (other than in the case of Incremental Revolving Commitments that increase an existing Class of Revolving Credit Commitments) the consent of the Swingline
Lender and each Issuing Bank (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), in which case, on the Incremental Amendment Date all Swingline Loans and Letters of Credit shall be participated on a pro rata basis by all Revolving Lenders in
accordance with their percentage of the Revolving Credit Commitments existing after giving effect to such Additional Credit Extension Amendment;
provided
that such election may be made conditional upon the maturity of one or more other
Revolving Credit Commitments;
provided
,
further
, that in connection with such election the Swingline Lender and the Issuing Banks may, in their sole discretion and with the consent of the Administrative Agent (not to be unreasonably

Credit Commitments effected by the Incremental Revolving Commitments,

Revolving Loans with respect to, and termination of, the Incremental Revolving Commitments after the applicable Incremental Amendment Date be made on a pro rata basis or less than pro rata basis with all other Revolving Credit Commitments (but not

shall be governed by the same assignment and participation provisions applicable to Revolving Credit Commitments and Revolving Loans then existing on the applicable Incremental Amendment Date,
(G) shall have an Applicable Rate determined by the Borrower and the applicable Incremental Revolving Lenders;
provided
that the Applicable Rate for an Incremental Revolving Commitment shall be (x) the Applicable Rate for the Class being increased or (y) higher than the Applicable Rate for the Class being increased as long as the Applicable Rate
for the Class being increased shall be automatically increased as and to the extent necessary to eliminate such deficiency, and
(H) shall have fees determined by the Borrower and the applicable arrangers of the Incremental Revolving Commitment.
125
(f) Incremental Term Commitments and Incremental Revolving Commitments shall become
additional Commitments pursuant to an Additional Credit Extension Amendment, executed by the Borrower, each Incremental Lender providing the respective Commitments, as applicable, and to the extent expressly provided above, the Administrative Agent
and, for purposes of any election and/or increase to the Swingline Sublimit or the Letter of Credit Sublimit pursuant to and in accordance with Section 2.20(e)(ii)(D), the Swingline Lender and each Issuing Bank. The Additional Credit Extension
Amendment may, without the consent of any other Loan Party, any Agent, Lender or Issuing Bank, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as may be necessary or appropriate, in the reasonable opinion of the Administrative
Agent and the Borrower, to effect the provisions of this Section 2.20, including amendments as deemed necessary by the Administrative Agent in its reasonable judgment to effect any lien or payment subordination and associated rights of the
applicable Lenders to the extent any such Incremental Extensions of Credit are to rank junior in right of security or payment or to address technical issues relating to funding and payments. The Borrower will use the proceeds of the Incremental Term
Loans and Incremental Revolving Commitments for any purpose not prohibited by this Agreement.
(g) Upon any Incremental Amendment Date on
which Incremental Revolving Commitments are effected through an increase to a Class of existing Revolving Credit Commitments pursuant to this Section 2.20, (i) each of the existing Revolving Lenders under such Class shall assign
to each of the Incremental Revolving Lenders, and each of the Incremental Revolving Lenders shall purchase from each of the existing Revolving Lenders under such Class, at the principal amount thereof, such interests in the Revolving Loans of such
Class outstanding on such Incremental Amendment Date as shall be necessary in order that, after giving effect to all such assignments and purchases, such Revolving Loans will be held by such existing Revolving Lenders and Incremental Revolving
Lenders ratably in accordance with their Revolving Credit Commitments of such Class after giving effect to the addition of such Incremental Revolving Commitments to the existing Revolving Credit Commitments of such Class, (ii) each
Incremental Revolving Commitment shall be deemed for all purposes a Revolving Credit Commitment and each Loan made thereunder shall be deemed, for all purposes, a Revolving Loan and (iii) each Incremental Revolving Lender shall become a Lender
with respect to the Revolving Credit Commitments and all matters relating thereto. The Administrative Agent and the Lenders hereby agree that the minimum borrowing and prepayment requirements in this Agreement shall not apply to the transactions
effected pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence.
(h) If on or prior to the
12-month
anniversary of the Closing Date the initial Effective Yield on any Incremental Term Loans borrowed hereunder exceeds the then applicable Effective Yield on the Initial Term Loans advanced on the Closing Date outstanding at such time by more than
50 basis points (the amount of such excess above 50 basis points being referred to herein as the “
Yield Differential
”) and such Incremental Term Loans meet the following conditions: (i) are incurred utilizing
the Incurrence Ratio (for the avoidance of doubt, Incremental Term Loans that are initially incurred under the Fixed Incremental Amount and later reclassified in accordance with this Agreement as having been incurred under the Incurrence Ratio shall
not be deemed for purposes of this sentence to have been incurred under the Incurrence Ratio), (ii) are secured by Liens on the Collateral on a
pari passu
basis with the Liens on the Collateral securing the Initial Term Loans and are
pari passu
in right of payment with the Initial Term Loans, (iii) have an outside maturity date that is on or prior to one year after the Latest Maturity Date of the Initial
126
Term Loans, (iv) are denominated in Dollars, (v) provide for the payment of interest at a floating rate, (vi) are broadly syndicated term loans and (vii) are incurred for any
purpose other than a Permitted Acquisition or any other permitted Investment, then solely to the extent that (1) Lenders holding more than 50% of the aggregate principal amount of the Initial Term Loans advanced on the Closing Date outstanding
at such time (
provided
that the Term Loans held by any Defaulting Lender shall be excluded for purposes of making such determination) have not waived the provisions of this clause (h) (such provisions, the “
MFN
Protection
”) and (2) the aggregate principal amount of all Incremental Term Loans that would be subject to the adjustment provided for in this sentence (after giving effect to all other carve-outs thereto) but for this clause (2)
exceeds the greater of (x) $20,000,000 and (y) 100.0% of TTM Consolidated EBITDA, the Applicable Rate then in effect for the Initial Term Loans advanced on the Closing Date shall automatically be increased by the Yield Differential (it being agreed
that any increase in the Effective Yield of such Initial Term Loans required solely due to the application of a Term SOFR floor or an ABR floor on any Incremental Term Loans shall be effected solely through an increase in (or implementation of, as
applicable) any Term SOFR floor or ABR floor applicable to such Initial Term Loans).
(i) The Incremental Term Loans made under each
increase of an existing Class of Term Loans shall be made by the applicable Lenders participating therein pursuant to the procedures set forth in Sections 2.01 and 2.02 (as may be conformed as necessary or appropriate as reasonably
determined by the applicable Incremental Term Lenders and the Borrower) and on the date of the making of such Incremental Term Loans, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in Sections 2.01 and 2.02, such Incremental Term Loans
shall be added to (and form part of) each Borrowing of outstanding Term Loans under the applicable Class of Term Loans on a pro rata basis (based on the relative sizes of the various outstanding Borrowings), so that each Lender under such
Class will participate proportionately in each then-outstanding Borrowing of Term Loans of such Class.
(j) To the extent any
Incremental Facility shall be denominated in a currency other than dollars, this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be amended to the extent necessary or appropriate to provide for the administrative and operational provisions applicable
to such currency, in each case as are reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the Borrower.
(k) Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement or any other Loan Document to the contrary, Incremental Term Commitments arranged as delayed draw term loan commitments shall not be included in the calculation of Required Lenders in any determination of whether the Required
Lenders have consented to any amendment or waiver with respect to any Term Loans until such delayed draw term loan commitments are fully funded unless, if elected by the Borrower, such delayed draw term loan commitments would have been permitted to
be drawn on the date of such determination (determined assuming that the sole condition to borrowing thereunder is sufficient capacity under the Maximum Incremental Amount) or the Required Lenders (calculated without including such commitments) have
otherwise agreed that such delayed draw term loan commitments shall be included in the calculation of Required Lenders.
(l) This
Section 2.20 shall supersede any provisions in this Agreement (including Sections 2.18 and 9.02) to the contrary.
127

(an “
Existing Term Loan Class
”) be amended to extend the scheduled maturity date(s) of any payment of principal with respect to all or a portion of any principal amount of such Term Loans (any such Term Loans which have been
so converted, “
Extended Term Loans
”) or that all or a portion of the Revolving Credit Commitments of any Class (an “
Existing Revolving Credit Commitment Class
”) be amended to extend the scheduled
termination date(s) thereof (any such Revolving Credit Commitments which have been so converted, “
Extended Revolving Credit Commitments
”) and, in each case, to provide for other terms consistent with this Section 2.21. In
order to establish any Extended Term Loans or Extended Revolving Credit Commitments, the Borrower shall provide a notice to the Administrative Agent (who shall provide a copy of such notice to each of the Lenders under the Existing Term Loan
Class or Existing Revolving Credit Commitment Class, as applicable) (an “
Extension Request
”) setting forth the proposed terms of the Extended Term Loans or Extended Revolving Credit Commitments, as applicable, to be
established, which shall be substantially consistent with the Term Loans under the Existing Term Loan Class from which such Extended Term Loans are to be converted or substantially consistent with the Revolving Credit Commitments under the
Existing Revolving Credit Commitment Class from which such Extended Revolving Credit Commitments are to be converted, as applicable, except that:
(i) all or any of the scheduled amortization payments of principal of the Extended Term Loans may be delayed to later dates
than the scheduled amortization payments of principal of the Term Loans of such Existing Term Loan Class to the extent provided in the applicable Additional Credit Extension Amendment,
(ii) the yield with respect to the Extended Term Loans or the Extended Revolving Credit Commitments (whether in the form of
interest rate margin, upfront fees, original issue discount or otherwise), as applicable, may be different than the yield for the Term Loans of such Existing Term Loan Class or the Revolving Credit Commitments of such Existing Revolving Credit
Commitment Class, as applicable, and upfront fees may be paid to the existing Term Lenders or the existing Revolving Lenders, as applicable, in each case, to the extent provided in the applicable Additional Credit Extension Amendment, and
(iii) the Additional Credit Extension Amendment may provide for, (except as to interest rates, fees, amortization, final
maturity date, “AHYDO” payments, optional prepayments, premium, required prepayment dates and participation in prepayments, which shall be determined by the Borrower and the applicable lenders providing the Extended Term Loans or the
Extended Revolving Credit Commitments and set forth in the relevant Extension Request), at the option of the Borrower, (x) market terms and conditions (taken as a whole) at the time of incurrence or issuance (as determined in good faith by the
Borrower) or (y) terms consistent with, or (taken as a whole) terms not materially more favorable to the lenders providing such Extended Term Loans or Extended Revolving Commitments, as applicable (unless (I) the lenders under the Existing
Term Loan Class or the Existing Revolving Credit Commitment Class also receive the benefit of such more restrictive terms or (II) such covenants or other provisions are applicable only to periods after the Maturity Date.
128
(b) Any Extended Term Loans converted pursuant to any Extension Request shall be designated
a series of Extended Term Loans for all purposes of this Agreement;
provided
that, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 2.21(a), any Extended Term Loans converted from an Existing Term Loan Class may, to the extent
provided in the applicable Additional Credit Extension Amendment and consistent with the requirements set forth above, be designated as an increase in any previously established Class of Term Loans.
(c) The Borrower shall provide the applicable Extension Request at least five (5) Business Days (or with such shorter period of advance
notice as the Administrative Agent may agree in its reasonable discretion) prior to the date on which Lenders under the applicable Existing Term Loan Class or Existing Revolving Credit Commitment Class are requested to respond. No Lender
shall have any obligation to agree to have any of its Term Loans of any Existing Term Loan Class or Revolving Credit Commitments of any Existing Revolving Credit Commitment Class converted into Extended Term Loans or Extended Revolving
Credit Commitments, as the case may be, pursuant to any Extension Request. Any Lender wishing to have all or a portion of its Term Loans under the Existing Term Loan Class subject to such Extension Request (such Lender
an “
Extending Term Lender
”) converted into Extended Term Loans or all or a portion of its Revolving Credit Commitments under the Existing Revolving Credit Commitment Class subject to such Extension Request (such Lender,
an “
Extending Revolving Lender
”) converted into Extended Revolving Credit Commitments, as the case may be, shall notify the Administrative Agent (an “
Extension Election
”) on or prior to the date
specified in such Extension Request of the amount of its Term Loans under the Existing Term Loan Class or the amount of its Revolving Credit Commitments under the Existing Revolving Credit Commitment Class, as the case may be, which it has
elected to request be converted into Extended Term Loans or Extended Revolving Credit Commitments, as the case may be (subject to any minimum denomination requirements reasonably imposed by the Administrative Agent and acceptable to the Borrower).
In the event that the aggregate amount of Term Loans under the Existing Term Loan Class or the aggregate amount of Revolving Credit Commitments under the Existing Revolving Credit Commitment Class, as the case may be, subject to Extension
Elections exceeds the amount of Extended Term Loans or Extended Revolving Credit Commitments, as the case may be, requested pursuant to an Extension Request, Term Loans of the Existing Term Loan Class or Revolving Credit Commitments of the
Existing Revolving Credit Commitment Class, as the case may be, subject to Extension Elections shall be converted to Extended Term Loans or Revolving Credit Commitments, as the case may be, on a pro rata basis based on the amount of Term Loans or
Revolving Credit Commitments, as the case may be, included in each such Extension Election (subject to any minimum denomination requirements reasonably imposed by the Administrative Agent and acceptable to the Borrower).
(d) The Borrower may, with the consent of each Person providing an Extended Revolving Credit Commitment, the Administrative Agent and any
Person acting as swingline lender or issuing bank under such Extended Revolving Credit Commitments, amend this Agreement pursuant to an Additional Credit Extension Amendment to provide for Extended Revolving Credit Commitments and to incorporate the
terms of such Extended Revolving Credit Commitments into this Agreement on substantially the same basis as provided with respect to the
129
Revolving Credit Commitments (except as otherwise provided herein);
provided
that (i) the establishment of any such Extended Revolving Credit Commitments shall be accompanied by a
corresponding reduction in the Revolving Credit Commitments and (ii) any reduction in the Revolving Credit Commitments may, at the option of the Borrower, be directed to a disproportional reduction of the Revolving Credit Commitments of any
Lender providing an Extended Revolving Credit Commitment.
(e) Extended Term Loans and Extended Revolving Credit Commitments shall be
established pursuant to an Additional Credit Extension Amendment to this Agreement among the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and each Extending Term Lender or Extending Revolving Lender, as the case may be, which shall be consistent with the
provisions set forth above (but which shall not require the consent of any other Person other than those consents expressly provided for in this Section 2.21). Each Additional Credit Extension Amendment shall be binding on the Lenders, the Loan
Parties and the other parties hereto. In connection with any Additional Credit Extension Amendment, the Loan Parties and the Administrative Agent shall enter into such amendments to the Loan Documents as may be reasonably requested by the
Administrative Agent (which shall not require any consent from any Lender other than those consents provided pursuant to this Agreement) in order to ensure that the Extended Term Loans or Extended Revolving Credit Commitments, as the case may be,
are provided with the benefit of the applicable Loan Documents and shall deliver such other documents, certificates and opinions of counsel in connection therewith as may be reasonably requested by the Administrative Agent.
(f) If, in connection with any proposed extension pursuant to this Section 2.21, any requested Lender declines to consent to the
applicable extension on the terms and by the deadline set forth in the applicable Extension Request (each such other Lender, a “
Non-Extending
Lender
”) then the Borrower may, upon notice
to the Administrative Agent and the
Non-Extending
Lender, replace such
Non-Extending
Lender by (x) causing such Lender to (and such shall be obligated to) assign
pursuant to Section 9.04 all of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to one or more assignees or (y) paying down such
Non-Extending
Lender’s Loans on a
non-pro
rata basis;
provided
that neither the Administrative Agent nor any Lender shall have any obligation to the Borrower to find a replacement Lender;
provided
,
further
, that the
applicable assignee shall have agreed to provide Extended Term Loans or Extended Revolving Credit Commitments on terms set forth in such Additional Credit Extension Amendment;
provided
,
further
, that all obligations of the Borrower
owing to the
Non-Extending
Lender relating to the existing Term Loans or Revolving Credit Commitments so assigned shall be paid in full by the assignee Lender to such
Non-Extending
Lender concurrently with such Assignment and Assumption. In connection with any such replacement under this Section 2.21, if the
Non-Extending
Lender
does not execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent a duly completed Assignment and Assumption by the later of (A) the date on which the replacement Lender executes and delivers such Assignment and Assumption and (B) the date as of
which all obligations of the Borrower owing to the
Non-Extending
Lender relating to the existing Term Loans or Revolving Credit Commitments so assigned shall be paid in full by the assignee Lender to such
Non-Extending
Lender, then such
Non-Extending
Lender shall be deemed to have executed and delivered such Assignment and Assumption as of such date and the Borrower shall be
entitled (but not obligated) to execute and deliver such Assignment and Assumption on behalf of such
Non-Extending
Lender.
130
(g) The provisions of this Section 2.21 shall override any provision of this Agreement
(including in Section 2.18 and Section 9.02) to the contrary. No conversion of Loans pursuant to any extension in accordance with this Section 2.21 shall constitute a voluntary or mandatory payment or prepayment for purposes of this
Agreement.
SECTION 2.22
Defaulting Lenders
. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if any Lender becomes
a Defaulting Lender, then the following provisions shall apply for so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender:
(a) (i) fees on the
unfunded portion of the Revolving Commitment of such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.12(a) and (ii) any other unused commitment fees shall, in each case, cease to accrue,
(b) the Loans, Revolving Commitments, Revolving Exposure, L/C Exposure, other Commitments (including any delayed draw term loan commitments)
and/or Swingline Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall not be included in determining whether the Required Lenders have taken or may take any action hereunder (including any consent to any amendment, waiver or other modification pursuant to
Section 9.02);
provided
that other than with respect to L/C Exposure or Swingline Exposure, this Section 2.22(b) shall not apply to the vote of a Defaulting Lender to the extent the consent of such Lender would be required under
clause (i), (ii), (iii) or (iv) in the proviso to the first sentence of Section 9.02(b),
(c) if any Swingline Exposure or
L/C Exposure exists at the time such Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender then:
(i) so long as no Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing as to which the Administrative Agent has received written notice from the Borrower or a Revolving Lender, all or any part of the Swingline Exposure and L/C Exposure of such Defaulting Lender shall be reallocated among the
non-Defaulting
Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages but only to the extent that (x) the sum of all
non-Defaulting
Lenders’ Revolving
Exposures
plus
such Defaulting Lender’s Swingline Exposure and L/C Exposure does not exceed the total of all
non-Defaulting
Lenders’ Revolving Commitments and (y) each
non-Defaulting
Lender’s Revolving Exposure plus its Applicable Percentage of such Defaulting Lender’s Swingline Exposure and L/C Exposure does not exceed such
non-Defaulting
Lender’s Revolving Commitment,
(ii) if the reallocation
described in subclause (i) above cannot, or can only partially, be effected, the Borrower shall within one (1) Business Day following written notice by the Administrative Agent (x)
first
, prepay such Swingline Exposure and
(y)
second
, cash collateralize, for the benefit of the applicable Issuing Bank only, the Borrower’s obligations corresponding to such Defaulting Lender’s L/C Exposure (after giving effect to any partial reallocation pursuant
to subclause (i) above) in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 2.05(j) for so long as such L/C Exposure is outstanding,
(iii) if the Borrower cash collateralizes any portion of such Defaulting Lender’s L/C Exposure pursuant to
subclause (ii) above, the Borrower shall not be required to pay any fees to such Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 2.12(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lender’s L/C Exposure during the period such Defaulting Lender’s L/C
Exposure is cash collateralized,
131
(iv) if the L/C Exposure of the
non-Defaulting
Lenders is reallocated pursuant to subclause (i) above, then the fees payable to the Lenders pursuant to Section 2.12(a) and Section 2.12(b) shall be adjusted in accordance with
such
non-Defaulting
Lenders’ Applicable Percentages,
(v) if all or any
portion of such Defaulting Lender’s L/C Exposure is neither reallocated nor cash collateralized pursuant to subclause (i) or (ii) above, then, without prejudice to any rights or remedies of the applicable Issuing Bank or any other
Lender hereunder, all fees that otherwise would have been payable to such Defaulting Lender (solely with respect to the portion of such Defaulting Lender’s Revolving Commitment that was utilized by such L/C Exposure) and letter of credit fees
payable under Section 2.12(b) with respect to such Defaulting Lender’s L/C Exposure shall be payable to the applicable Issuing Bank until and to the extent that such L/C Exposure is reallocated and/or cash collateralized, and
(vi) so long as such Lender is a Defaulting Lender, the Swingline Lender shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loan and
none of the Issuing Banks shall be required to issue, amend, extend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless it is satisfied that the related exposure and the Defaulting Lender’s then outstanding L/C Exposure will be 100% covered by the
Commitments of the
non-Defaulting
Lenders and/or cash collateral will be provided by the Borrower in accordance with Section 2.22(c), and participating interests in any newly made Swingline Loan or any
newly issued or increased Letter of Credit shall be allocated among
non-Defaulting
Lenders in a manner consistent with Section 2.22(c)(i) (and such Defaulting Lender shall not participate therein).
(d) If (i) a Bankruptcy Event with respect to a parent entity of any Revolving Lender shall occur following the Closing Date and for so
long as such event shall continue or (ii) the Swingline Lender or an Issuing Bank has a good faith belief that any Revolving Lender has defaulted in fulfilling its obligations under one or more other agreements in which such Lender commits to
extend credit, the Swingline Lender shall not be required to fund any Swingline Loan and such Issuing Bank shall not be required to issue, amend or increase any Letter of Credit, unless the Swingline Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be,
shall have entered into arrangements with the Borrower or such Lender, reasonably satisfactory to the Swingline Lender or such Issuing Bank, as the case may be, to defease any risk to it in respect of such Lender hereunder.
(e) In the event that the Administrative Agent, the Borrower, the Swingline Lender and each Issuing Bank each agrees that a Defaulting Lender
has adequately remedied all matters that caused such Lender to be a Defaulting Lender, then the Swingline Exposure and L/C Exposure of the Revolving Lenders shall be readjusted to reflect the inclusion of such Lender’s Revolving Commitment and
on such date such Lender shall purchase at par such of the Revolving Loans of the other Revolving Lenders as the Administrative Agent shall determine may be necessary in order for such Lender to hold Revolving Loans in accordance with its Applicable
Percentage (whereupon such Lender shall cease to be a Defaulting Lender);
provided
that except to the extent expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of
any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender having been a Defaulting Lender.

information of Borrower and its Subsidiaries by furnishing the applicable financial statements of any direct or indirect parent of Borrower, or Borrower’s or such parent’s

extent such
142
information relates to a direct or indirect parent of Borrower, if and for so long as such parent will have independent assets or operations, such information is accompanied by consolidating

stand-alone basis, on the other hand.
Documents required to be delivered pursuant to Section 5.01 may, at the Borrower’s
option, be delivered electronically or by posting such documents electronically, and if so delivered or posted, such documents shall be deemed to have been delivered on the date on which the Borrower delivers such documents or posts such documents

provided
that upon the reasonable request of the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent
with respect to any specific document so delivered or posted electronically, the Borrower shall promptly deliver a physical copy of such document. Without limiting the foregoing, the Borrower may satisfy its obligation to deliver any report or other
information hereunder at any time by filing such information with the SEC and providing written notice (which notice may be by facsimile or electronic mail) to the Administrative Agent that such information has been filed.
To the extent any report or other information under this Section 5.01 is not delivered within the time periods specified under this
Section 5.01 and such report or other information is subsequently delivered prior to the time such failure results in an Event of Default due to the Borrower’s failure to deliver such report or other information within such requisite time
periods, the Borrower will be deemed to have satisfied its obligations under this Section 5.01 and any Default with respect to its obligations under this Section 5.01 (and any other Default or Event of Default arising as a result thereof)
shall be deemed to have been cured.

result, in a Material Adverse Effect.
Each notice delivered under this Section 5.02 shall be accompanied by a statement of a
Responsible Officer or other executive officer of the Borrower setting forth the details of the event or development requiring such notice and any action taken or proposed to be taken with respect thereto.

necessary and material to the conduct of its business, except, other than in the case of maintaining legal existence, as would not reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect;
provided
that the foregoing shall not prohibit

aside on its books adequate reserves with respect thereto in accordance with GAAP.
SECTION 5.06
Maintenance of Properties

Administrative Agent, but in any event, which request may not be made more than one (1) time per fiscal year (so long as the Administrative Agent otherwise has proof of valid insurance on file), information in reasonable detail as to the
insurance so maintained. Subject to Section 5.15, such insurance to the extent constituting property or general liability insurance shall name the Collateral Agent as additional insured or lender loss payee, as applicable.
(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if any improved portion of any Mortgaged Property is at any time located in an
area identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (or any successor agency) as a special flood hazard area with respect to which flood insurance has been made available under the Flood Insurance Laws, then the Borrower shall, or shall cause
the applicable Loan Party to (i) to the extent required pursuant to the Flood Insurance Laws, maintain, or cause to be maintained, with a financially sound and reputable insurer (determined at the time such insurance is obtained), flood

hereto.
SECTION 5.12
Additional Subsidiaries; Succeeding Holdings
.
(a) If any additional Restricted Subsidiary (other than an Excluded Subsidiary) is formed or acquired after the Closing Date or if any
Excluded Subsidiary that is not a Subsidiary Loan Party ceases to qualify as an Excluded Subsidiary, the Borrower will, within ninety (90) days (or such longer period as the Administrative Agent may agree in its reasonable discretion) after the
date such Restricted Subsidiary has been formed or acquired (or the date on which such Subsidiary ceases to constitute an Excluded Subsidiary), notify the Collateral Agent and the Lenders (through the Administrative Agent) thereof and within such
ninety
(90)-day
period (or such longer period as the Administrative Agent may agree) cause the Collateral and Guarantee Requirement to be satisfied with respect to such Subsidiary and with respect to any
Equity Interest in or Indebtedness of such Subsidiary owned by or on behalf of any Loan Party.

(c) If, after the Closing Date, any Loan Party acquires any Material Real Property (other than an Excluded Asset), the Borrower shall promptly
notify the Administrative Agent thereof and shall, or shall cause the applicable Loan Party, to satisfy the Collateral and Guarantee Requirement with respect to such Material Real Property within

Section 9.03.
SECTION 5.14
Designation of Subsidiaries
. The Borrower may at any time after the Closing Date designate any
other Restricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary or any Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary;
provided
that (a) immediately after such designation, no Specified Default shall have occurred and be continuing
immediately after giving effect thereto and (b) no Subsidiary may be designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary if, after such designation, it would be a “Restricted Subsidiary” for the purpose of any Specified Indebtedness or any
Permitted Refinancing thereof;
provided
,
further
, that to the extent that any Restricted Subsidiary owns, or holds exclusive licenses or rights to, any Material Intellectual Property, the Borrower shall not be permitted to designate
such Restricted Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary (it being understood that this proviso shall solely be tested at the time of such designation). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Loan Party or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries shall (whether by Investment, Restricted Payment, disposition or otherwise) transfer any ownership right in, or exclusive license or exclusive right of use to, any Material Intellectual Property to any Unrestricted Subsidiary
(including by transferring any Equity Interests of Holdings, the Borrower or any of their Restricted Subsidiaries to an Unrestricted Subsidiary). The designation of any Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary after the Closing Date shall constitute
an Investment by the Borrower therein at the date of designation in an amount equal to the Fair Market Value of such Investment at the date of designation. The designation of any Unrestricted Subsidiary as a Restricted Subsidiary shall constitute
(I) the incurrence at the time of designation of any Indebtedness or Liens of such Subsidiary existing at such time and (II) a return on any Investment by the Borrower in Unrestricted Subsidiaries pursuant to the preceding sentence in an
amount equal to the Fair Market Value of such Investment in such Subsidiary. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower shall not constitute an Unrestricted Subsidiary.

provided
that the
Administrative Agent may, in its reasonable judgment, grant extensions of time for compliance with or exceptions to the provisions of this Section 5.15. All conditions precedent, covenants and representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall be deemed modified to the extent necessary to effect the foregoing (and to permit the taking of the actions described in this Section 5.15 and on Schedule 5.15 within the time period required by
this Section 5.15 (as may be extended)), rather than as elsewhere provided in this Agreement or any other Loan Document.
SECTION
5.16
Lender Calls
. Commencing with the fiscal quarter of the Borrower ending March 31, 2026 and continuing until the fiscal quarter of the Borrower immediately prior to the fiscal quarter in which a Qualified IPO is consummated, and

SECTION 5.18

175
SECTION 7.02
Borrower’s Right to Cure
.
(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 7.01, in the event that the Borrower fails to comply with the
requirements of the Financial Covenant set forth in Section 6.12 (a “
Financial Covenant Default
”), after the first day of the fiscal period for which the applicable Financial Covenant is being measured, but on or prior
to the date that is fifteen (15) Business Days subsequent to the date on which the Compliance Certificate with respect to such fiscal period is required to be delivered pursuant to Section 5.01, the Borrower shall have the right to issue
Permitted Securities (or any other contribution to capital) or sale or issuance of any other Equity Interests on terms reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent) (collectively, the “
Cure Right
”);
provided
that at the Borrower’s option, the Borrower may elect to exercise such Cure Right prior to the date of the delivery of the applicable Compliance Certificate if the Borrower determines that it will fail to comply with the requirements of the
Financial Covenants upon the delivery of such Compliance Certificate, and upon the receipt by the Borrower of such cash (the “
Cure Amount
”) pursuant to the exercise by the Borrower of such Cure Right, the applicable Financial
Covenant(s) shall be recalculated giving effect to the following pro forma adjustments:
(i) Liquidity, Revenue and
Consolidated EBITDA shall be increased, solely for the purpose of measuring the applicable Financial Covenant(s) at the end of the applicable fiscal quarter and applicable subsequent periods which include such fiscal quarter and not for any other
purpose under this Agreement, by an amount equal to the Cure Amount; and
(ii) if, after giving effect to the foregoing
recalculations, the Borrower shall then be in compliance with the requirements of the applicable Financial Covenants, the Borrower shall be deemed to have satisfied the requirements of the Financial Covenants as of the relevant date of determination
with the same effect as though there had been no failure to comply therewith at such date, and the breach or default in respect of the applicable Financial Covenant(s) (including any Default or Event of Default arising from such breach or default)
that had occurred (and any other Default or Event of Default arising as a result thereof) shall be deemed cured for the purposes of this Agreement.
(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) in each four-fiscal-quarter period there shall be at least two (2) fiscal
quarters in which the Cure Right is not exercised and no more than five (5) Cure Rights shall be exercised in the aggregate following the Closing Date, (ii) the Cure Amount shall be no greater than the amount required for purposes of
complying with the applicable Financial Covenant(s) and (iii) any Cure Right used to cure multiple concurrent breaches of the Revenue Covenant, the Liquidity Covenant and/or the Leverage Covenant shall only count as one (1) Cure Right.
176
(c) The Cure Right and the effects thereof on determining pricing, financial ratio-based
conditions (other than for determining actual compliance with Section 6.12) or any baskets with respect to covenants will be disregarded for all other purposes under the Loan Documents, including, without limitation, for purposes of calculating
the leverage ratios as a threshold for permitted exceptions to any affirmative and negative covenants. Any reduction in the outstanding principal balance of the Loans due to the application of the proceeds of an exercise of a Cure Right in
connection with a prepayment pursuant to Section 2.11 shall not be taken into account for purposes of determining compliance with the Leverage Covenant for the measurement period ending on the last day of the applicable fiscal quarter for which
the Cure Right is exercised;
provided
,
however
, that to the extent such proceeds are actually applied to prepay Indebtedness, such reduction shall be given effect in determining compliance with the Leverage Covenant in any subsequent
fiscal quarter. In addition, exercise of the Cure Right shall not result in any adjustment to any amounts (including the amount of Indebtedness) or increase in cash (other than for purposes of testing the Liquidity Covenant) for the fiscal quarter
for which the Cure Right was exercised (and shall not be included for purposes of determining pricing, mandatory prepayments and the availability or amount permitted pursuant to any covenant under Article VI).
So long as the Borrower is entitled to exercise a Cure Right pursuant to the foregoing terms and provisions of this Section 7.02, none of
the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender shall impose default interest, accelerate the Obligations or exercise any enforcement remedy against any Loan Party or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties solely
on the basis of the applicable Financial Covenant Default (or any other Default or Event of Default arising solely as a result thereof at any time during the period in which the Borrower is entitled to exercise a Cure Right);
provided
that
until timely receipt of the Cure Amount, no Lender or Issuing Bank shall be required to fund any Loan or issue, renew or extend any Letter of Credit pursuant to Section 4.02;
provided
,
further
, that notwithstanding the foregoing,
upon a deemed cure pursuant to this Section 7.02, the requirements of the applicable Financial Covenant(s) shall be deemed to have been satisfied as of the applicable fiscal quarter with the same effect as though there had been no Financial
Covenant Default (or any other Default or Event of Default arising as a result thereof) at such date or thereafter.

The Administrative Agent
SECTION
8.01
Authorization and Action
.
(a) Each Lender and each Issuing Bank hereby irrevocably appoints Wells Fargo and its permitted
successors and assigns to serve as the administrative agent and collateral agent under the Loan Documents and each Lender and each Issuing Bank authorizes the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent to take such actions as agent on its behalf
and to exercise such powers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as are delegated to the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent under such agreements and to exercise such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Without
limiting the foregoing, each Lender and each Issuing Bank hereby authorizes each of the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent to execute and deliver, and to perform its obligations under, each of the Loan Documents to which the
Administrative Agent and/or the Collateral Agent is a party, as the case may be, and to exercise all rights, powers and remedies that the Administrative Agent and/or the Collateral Agent, as the case may be, may have under such Loan Documents.
177
(b) As to any matters not expressly provided for herein and in the other Loan Documents
(including enforcement or collection), the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent shall not be required to exercise any discretion or take any action, but shall be required to act or to refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected in so
acting or refraining from acting) upon the written instructions of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary, pursuant to the terms in the Loan Documents), and, unless and until revoked in writing,
such instructions shall be binding upon each Lender and each Issuing Bank;
provided
,
however
, that the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent shall not be required to take any action that (i) the Administrative Agent or the
Collateral Agent in good faith believes exposes it to liability unless the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent receive an indemnification and each is exculpated in a manner satisfactory to it from the Lenders and the Issuing Banks with
respect to such action or (ii) is contrary to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or applicable law, including any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any requirement of law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or
reorganization or relief of debtors or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any requirement of law relating to bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization or relief of debtors;
provided
,
further
, that the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent may seek clarification or direction from the Required Lenders prior to the exercise of any such instructed action and may refrain from acting until such
clarification or direction has been provided. Except as expressly set forth in the Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any
information relating to the Borrower, any Subsidiary or any Affiliate of any of the foregoing that is communicated to or obtained by the Person serving as Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. Nothing in this Agreement shall
require the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the performance of any of its duties hereunder or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers if it shall have
reasonable grounds for believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it. In furtherance of the foregoing, the protections, exculpations, privileges and immunities afforded to
the Administrative Agent shall also apply to the Collateral Agent and for such purposes references in this Article VIII to the Administrative Agent shall include the Collateral Agent.
(c) In performing its functions and duties hereunder and under the other Loan Documents, the Administrative Agent is acting solely on behalf
of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks (except in limited circumstances expressly provided for herein relating to the maintenance of the Register), and its duties are entirely mechanical and administrative in nature. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing:
(i) the Administrative Agent does not assume and shall not be deemed to have assumed any obligation or duty
or any other relationship as the agent, fiduciary or trustee of or for any Lender, Issuing Bank or holder of any other obligation other than as expressly set forth herein and in the other Loan Documents, regardless of whether a Default or an Event
of Default has occurred and is continuing (and it is understood and agreed that the use of the term “agent” (or any similar term) herein or in any other Loan Document with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote
any fiduciary duty or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable law, and that such term is used as a matter of market custom and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship
between contracting parties); additionally, each Lender agrees that it will not assert any claim against the Administrative Agent based on an alleged breach of fiduciary duty by the Administrative Agent in connection with this Agreement and/or the
transactions contemplated hereby; and
178
(ii) nothing in this Agreement or any Loan Document shall require the
Administrative Agent to account to any Lender for any sum or the profit element of any sum received by the Administrative Agent for its own account.
(d) The Administrative Agent may perform any of its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other Loan Document by or
through any one or more
sub-agents
appointed by the Administrative Agent (other than any Disqualified Institution). The Administrative Agent and any such
sub-agent
may
perform any of their respective duties and exercise their respective rights and powers through their respective Related Parties (other than any Disqualified Institution). The exculpatory provisions of this Article shall apply to any such
sub-agent
and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such
sub-agent,
and shall apply to their respective activities pursuant to this Agreement. The
Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any
sub-agent
except to the extent that a court of competent jurisdiction determines in a final and nonappealable judgment that
the Administrative Agent acted with bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct in the selection of such
sub-agent.
(e) The Arrangers shall not have any obligations or duties whatsoever in such capacity under this Agreement or any other Loan Document and
shall incur no liability hereunder or thereunder in such capacity, but all such Persons shall have the benefit of any indemnities expressly provided for them hereunder.
(f) In case of the pendency of any proceeding with respect to any Loan Party under any Federal, state or foreign bankruptcy, insolvency,
receivership or similar law now or hereafter in effect, the Administrative Agent (irrespective of whether the principal of any Loan or any unreimbursed LC Disbursement shall then be due and payable as herein expressed or by declaration or otherwise
and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent shall have made any demand on the Borrower) shall be entitled and empowered (but not obligated) by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise:
(i) to file and prove a claim for the whole amount of the principal and interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Loans, LC
Disbursements and all other Obligations that are owing and unpaid and to file such other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Administrative Agent (including any claim under
Sections 2.12, 2.13, 2.15, 2.17 and 9.03) allowed in such judicial proceeding; and
(ii) to collect and receive any
monies or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute the same; and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official in any such proceeding is hereby authorized by each
Lender, each Issuing Bank and each other Secured Party to make such payments to the Administrative Agent and, in the event that the Administrative Agent shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Lenders, the Issuing Banks or the
other Secured Parties, to pay to the Administrative Agent any amount due to it, in its
179
capacity as the Administrative Agent, under the Loan Documents (including under Section 9.03). Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Administrative Agent to authorize or
consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Lender or Issuing Bank any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Obligations or the rights of any Lender or Issuing Bank or to authorize the Administrative Agent
to vote in respect of the claim of any Lender or Issuing Bank in any such proceeding.
(g) Except with respect to Sections 8.01,
8.05, 8.06 and 8.07, (i) the provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Banks, and (ii) except solely to the extent of the Borrower’s rights to consent pursuant to
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Article, none of the Borrower or any Subsidiary, or any of their respective Affiliates, shall have any rights as a third party beneficiary under any such provisions. Each Secured Party, whether or not
a party hereto, will be deemed, by its acceptance of the benefits of the Collateral and of the Guarantees of the Obligations provided under the Loan Documents, to have agreed to the provisions of this Article.

(stating that it is a “notice of Default” or a “notice of an Event of Default”) is given to the Administrative Agent by the Borrower, a Lender or an Issuing Bank. Further, the Administrative Agent shall not be responsible for
or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with any Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other document delivered thereunder or in

Issuing Bank as a result of, any determination of the Revolving Exposure, any of the component amounts thereof or any portion thereof attributable to each Lender or Issuing Bank.

promissory note has been assigned in accordance with Section 9.04, (ii) may rely on the Register to the extent set forth in Section 9.04(b), (iii) may consult with legal counsel (including counsel to the Borrower), independent

condition is satisfactory to such Lender or Issuing Bank unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice to the contrary from such Lender or Issuing Bank sufficiently in advance of the making of such Loan or the issuance of such Letter of
Credit and (vi) shall be entitled to rely on, and shall incur no liability under or in respect of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by acting upon, any notice, consent, certificate or other instrument or writing (which writing may be a

Lenders” and any similar terms shall, unless the context clearly otherwise indicates, include the Administrative Agent in its individual capacity as a Lender, Issuing Bank or as one of the Required Lenders, as the case may be. The Person
serving as the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, own securities of, act as the financial advisor or in any other advisory capacity for and generally engage in any kind of banking, trust or other
business with, the Borrower, any Subsidiary or any Affiliate of any of the foregoing as if such Person was not acting as the Administrative Agent and without any duty to account therefor to the Lenders or the Issuing Banks.
SECTION 8.05
Successor Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent
.
(a) The Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent may resign at any time by giving thirty (30) days’ prior written notice thereof
to the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Borrower, whether or not a successor Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent has been appointed. Upon any such resignation, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint a successor Administrative
Agent or Collateral Agent, as the case may be, from among the Lenders or any of their Affiliates or another financial institution, in each case, reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower. If no successor Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as
the case may be, shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders, and shall have accepted such appointment, within thirty (30) days after the retiring Administrative Agent’s or Collateral Agent’s giving of notice of
resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Banks, appoint a successor Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent from among the Lenders or any of their Affiliates or another
financial institution, in each case, reasonably satisfactory to the Borrower. In either case, such appointment shall be subject to the prior written approval of the Borrower (which approval may not be unreasonably withheld and shall not be required
while a Specified Default has occurred and is continuing). Upon the acceptance of any appointment as Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as the case may be, by a successor Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, such successor Administrative
Agent or Collateral Agent shall succeed to, and become vested with, all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as the case may be. Upon the
183
acceptance of appointment as Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent by a successor Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as the case may be, the retiring Administrative Agent or Collateral
Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations (other than confidentiality obligations under Section 9.12) as the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as the case may be, under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Prior
to any retiring Administrative Agent’s or Collateral Agent’s resignation hereunder as Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, the retiring Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as the case may be, shall take such action as may be
reasonably necessary to assign to the successor Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent its rights as Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as the case may be, under the Loan Documents.
(b) Notwithstanding Section 8.05(a), in the event no successor Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as the case may be, shall have
been so appointed and shall have accepted such appointment within thirty (30) days after the retiring Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent gives notice of its intent to resign, the retiring Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as the
case may be, may give notice of the effectiveness of its resignation to the Lenders, the Issuing Banks and the Borrower, whereupon, on the date of effectiveness of such resignation stated in such notice, (i) the retiring Administrative Agent or
Collateral Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations (other than confidentiality obligations under Section 9.12) as Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as the case may be, hereunder and under the other Loan Documents;
provided
that, solely for purposes of maintaining any security interest granted to the Collateral Agent under any Security Document for the benefit of the Secured Parties, the retiring Collateral Agent (including, to the extent that the
retiring Administrative Agent also serves as the Collateral Agent, the Administrative Agent in its capacity as Collateral Agent) shall continue to be vested with such security interest as collateral agent for the benefit of the Secured Parties, and
continue to be entitled to the rights set forth in such Security Document and the other Loan Documents, and, in the case of any Collateral in the possession of the retiring Collateral Agent, shall continue to hold such Collateral, in each case until
such time as a successor Collateral Agent is appointed and accepts such appointment in accordance with this Section (it being understood and agreed that the retiring Collateral Agent shall have no duty or obligation to take any further action under
any Security Document, including any action required to maintain the perfection of any such security interest) and (ii) the Required Lenders shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring
Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as the case may be;
provided
that (A) all payments required to be made hereunder or under any other Loan Document to the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as the case may be, for the
account of any Person other than the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent shall be made directly to such Person and (B) all notices and other communications required or contemplated to be given or made to the Administrative Agent or the
Collateral Agent, as the case may be, shall directly be given or made to each Lender and each Issuing Bank. Following the effectiveness of the Administrative Agent’s or Collateral Agent’s, as the case may be, resignation from its
capacity as such, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.03, as well as any exculpatory, reimbursement and indemnification provisions set forth in any other Loan Document, shall continue in effect for the benefit of such retiring
Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, its
sub-agents
and their respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by any of them while the retiring Administrative Agent or
Collateral Agent was acting as Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent, as the case may be.
184
SECTION 8.06
Acknowledgements of Lenders and Issuing Banks
.
(a) Each Lender and each Issuing Bank represents and warrants that (i) the Loan Documents set forth the terms of a commercial lending
facility, (ii) it is engaged in making, acquiring or holding commercial loans and in providing other facilities set forth herein as may be applicable to such Lender or Issuing Bank, in each case in the ordinary course of business, and not for
the purpose of purchasing, acquiring or holding any other type of financial instrument (and each Lender and each Issuing Bank agrees not to assert a claim in contravention of the foregoing), (iii) it has, independently and without reliance upon
the Administrative Agent, any Arranger, or any other Lender or Issuing Bank, or any of the Related Parties of any of the foregoing, and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision
to enter into this Agreement as a Lender, and to make, acquire or hold Loans hereunder and (iv) it is sophisticated with respect to decisions to make, acquire and/or hold commercial loans and to provide other facilities set forth herein, as may
be applicable to such Lender or such Issuing Bank, and either it, or the Person exercising discretion in making its decision to make, acquire and/or hold such commercial loans or to provide such other facilities, is experienced in making, acquiring
or holding such commercial loans or providing such other facilities. Each Lender and each Issuing Bank also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, any Arranger or any other Lender or Issuing
Bank, or any of the Related Parties of any of the foregoing, and based on such documents and information (which may contain material,
non-public
information within the meaning of the United States securities
laws concerning the Borrower and its Affiliates) as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any related agreement
or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.
(b) Each Lender, by delivering its signature page to this Agreement on the Closing
Date, or delivering its signature page to an Assignment and Assumption or any other Loan Document pursuant to which it shall become a Lender hereunder, shall be deemed to have acknowledged receipt of, and consented to and approved, each Loan
Document and each other document required to be delivered to, or be approved by or satisfactory to, the Administrative Agent or the Lenders on the Closing Date.
(c) (i) Each Lender hereby agrees that (x) if the Administrative Agent notifies such Lender that the Administrative Agent has
determined in its sole discretion that any funds received by such Lender from the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates (whether as a payment, prepayment or repayment of principal, interest, fees or otherwise; individually and collectively,
a “
Payment
”) were erroneously transmitted to such Lender (whether or not known to such Lender), and demands the return of such Payment (or a portion thereof), such Lender shall promptly, but in no event later than one
Business Day thereafter (or such later date as the Administrative Agent, may, in its sole discretion, specify in writing), return to the Administrative Agent the amount of any such Payment (or portion thereof) as to which such a demand was made in
same day funds, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such Payment (or portion thereof) was received by such Lender to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent at the greater of the
Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation from time to time in effect, and (y) to the extent permitted by applicable law, such Lender shall
185
not assert, and hereby waives, as to the Administrative Agent, any claim, counterclaim, defense or right of
set-off
or recoupment with respect to any
demand, claim or counterclaim by the Administrative Agent for the return of any Payments received, including without limitation any defense based on “discharge for value” or any similar doctrine. A notice of the Administrative Agent to
any Lender under this Section 8.06(c) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.
(ii) Each Lender hereby further
agrees that if it receives a Payment from the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates (x) that is in a different amount than, or on a different date from, that specified in a notice of payment sent by the Administrative Agent (or any
of its Affiliates) with respect to such Payment (a “
Payment Notice
”) or (y) that was not preceded or accompanied by a Payment Notice, it shall be on notice, in each such case, that an error has been made with respect to
such Payment. Each Lender agrees that, in each such case, or if it otherwise becomes aware a Payment (or portion thereof) may have been sent in error, such Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent of such occurrence and, upon
demand from the Administrative Agent, it shall promptly, but in no event later than one Business Day thereafter, return to the Administrative Agent the amount of any such Payment (or portion thereof) as to which such a demand was made in same day
funds, together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such Payment (or portion thereof) was received by such Lender to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent at the greater of the Federal Funds
Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation from time to time in effect.
(iii) The Borrower and each other Loan Party hereby agrees that (x) in the event an erroneous Payment (or portion thereof)
is not recovered from any Lender that has received such Payment (or portion thereof) for any reason, the Administrative Agent shall be subrogated to all the rights of such Lender with respect to such amount and (y) an erroneous Payment shall
not pay, prepay, repay, discharge or otherwise satisfy any Obligations owed by the Borrower or any other Loan Party except, in each case, to the extent such erroneous Payment is, and solely with respect to the amount of such erroneous Payment that
is, comprised of funds of (or on behalf of) the Borrower, any other Loan Party or other Subsidiary.
(iv) Each
party’s obligations under this Section 8.06(c) shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any transfer of rights or obligations by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments or
the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all Obligations under any Loan Document.
(d) The Lenders acknowledge that there may be a
constant flow of information (including information which may be subject to confidentiality obligations in favor of the Loan Parties) between the Loan Parties and their Affiliates, on the one hand, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association and its
Affiliates, on the other hand. Without limiting the foregoing, the Loan Parties or their Affiliates may provide information, including updates to previously provided information to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association and/or its Affiliates acting
in different capacities, including as Lender, lead bank, arranger or potential securities investor, independent of such entity’s role as administrative agent hereunder. The Lenders acknowledge that neither Wells Fargo Bank, National
Association nor its Affiliates shall be under any obligation to provide any
186
of the foregoing information to them. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein or in any other Loan Document, except for notices, reports and other documents expressly required
to be furnished to the Lenders by the Administrative Agent herein, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or responsibility to provide, and shall not be liable for the failure to provide, any Lender with any credit or other information
concerning the Loans, the Lenders, the business, prospects, operations, property, financial and other condition or creditworthiness of any of the Loan Parties or any of their respective Affiliates that is communicated to, obtained by, or in the
possession of, the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity, including any information obtained by the Administrative Agent in the course of communications among the Administrative Agent and any Loan Party, any Affiliate thereof
or any other Person.
SECTION 8.07
Collateral Matters
.
(a) Except with respect to the exercise of setoff rights in accordance with Section 9.08 or with respect to a Secured Party’s right
to file a proof of claim in an insolvency proceeding, no Secured Party shall have any right individually to realize upon any of the Collateral, to enforce any Guarantee of the Obligations or otherwise enforce the Loan Documents, it being understood
and agreed that all powers, rights and remedies under the Loan Documents may be exercised solely by the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent on behalf of the Secured Parties in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents.
(b) In furtherance of the foregoing and not in limitation thereof, no arrangements in respect of cash management services the
obligations under which constitute Cash Management Obligations, and no Swap Agreement which constitutes a Secured Hedge Agreement, will create (or be deemed to create) in favor of any Secured Party that is a party thereto any rights in connection
with the management or release of any Collateral or of the obligations of any Loan Party under any Loan Document. By accepting the benefits of the Collateral, each Secured Party that is a party to any such arrangement in respect of cash management
services or any Swap Agreement, as applicable, shall be deemed to have appointed the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent to serve as administrative agent and collateral agent, respectively, under the Loan Documents and agreed to be bound
by the Loan Documents as a Secured Party thereunder, subject to the limitations set forth in this clause (b).
(c) The Secured
Parties irrevocably authorize and instruct the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, to subordinate any Lien on any property granted to or held by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, as applicable, under any Loan
Document to the holder of any Lien on such property that is permitted by Section 6.02(d), (e) or (q) or Section 9.17 to the extent requested by the Borrower. The Collateral Agent shall not be responsible for or have a duty to
ascertain or inquire into any representation or warranty regarding the existence, value or collectability of the Collateral, the existence, priority or perfection of the Collateral Agent’s Lien thereon or any certificate prepared by any Loan
Party in connection therewith, nor shall the Collateral Agent be responsible or liable to the Lenders or any other Secured Party for any failure to monitor or maintain any portion of the Collateral.
187
SECTION 8.08
Credit Bidding
. The Secured Parties hereby irrevocably authorize the
Administrative Agent, at the direction of the Required Lenders, to credit bid all or any portion of the Obligations (including by accepting some or all of the Collateral in satisfaction of some or all of the Obligations pursuant to a deed in lieu of
foreclosure or otherwise) and in such manner purchase (either directly or through one or more acquisition vehicles) all or any portion of the Collateral (a) at any sale thereof conducted under the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, including
under Sections 363, 1123 or 1129 of the Bankruptcy Code, or any similar laws in any other jurisdictions to which a Loan Party is subject, or (b) at any other sale, foreclosure or acceptance of collateral in lieu of debt conducted by (or
with the consent or at the direction of) the Administrative Agent (whether by judicial action or otherwise) in accordance with any applicable law. In connection with any such credit bid and purchase, the Obligations owed to the Secured Parties shall
be entitled to be, and shall be, credit bid by the Administrative Agent at the direction of the Required Lenders on a ratable basis (with Obligations with respect to contingent or unliquidated claims receiving contingent interests in the acquired
assets on a ratable basis that shall vest upon the liquidation of such claims in an amount proportional to the liquidated portion of the contingent claim amount used in allocating the contingent interests) for the asset or assets so purchased (or
for the equity interests or debt instruments of the acquisition vehicle or vehicles that are issued in connection with such purchase). In connection with any such bid, (i) the Administrative Agent shall be authorized to form one or more
acquisition vehicles and to assign any successful credit bid to such acquisition vehicle or vehicles, (ii) each of the Secured Parties’ ratable interests in the Obligations which were credit bid shall be deemed without any further action
under this Agreement to be assigned to such vehicle or vehicles for the purpose of closing such sale, (iii) the Administrative Agent shall be authorized to adopt documents providing for the governance of the acquisition vehicle or vehicles
(
provided
that any actions by the Administrative Agent with respect to such acquisition vehicle or vehicles, including any disposition of the assets or equity interests thereof, shall be governed, directly or indirectly, by, and the governing
documents shall provide for, control by the vote of the Required Lenders or their permitted assignees under the terms of this Agreement or the governing documents of the applicable acquisition vehicle or vehicles, as the case may be, irrespective of
the termination of this Agreement and without giving effect to the limitations on actions by the Required Lenders contained in Section 9.02), (iv) the Administrative Agent on behalf of such acquisition vehicle or vehicles shall be
authorized to issue to each of the Secured Parties, ratably on account of the relevant Obligations which were credit bid, interests, whether as equity, partnership interests, limited partnership interests or membership interests, in any such
acquisition vehicle and/or debt instruments issued by such acquisition vehicle, all without the need for any Secured Party or acquisition vehicle to take any further action, and (v) to the extent that Obligations that are assigned to an
acquisition vehicle are not used to acquire Collateral for any reason (as a result of another bid being higher or better, because the amount of Obligations assigned to the acquisition vehicle exceeds the amount of Obligations credit bid by the
acquisition vehicle or otherwise), such Obligations shall automatically be reassigned to the Secured Parties pro rata with their original interest in such Obligations and the equity interests and/or debt instruments issued by any acquisition vehicle
on account of such Obligations shall automatically be cancelled, without the need for any Secured Party or any acquisition vehicle to take any further action. Notwithstanding that the ratable portion of the Obligations of each Secured Party are
deemed assigned to the acquisition vehicle or vehicles as set forth in clause (ii) above, each Secured Party shall execute such documents and provide such information regarding the Secured Party (and/or any designee of the Secured Party which
will receive interests in or debt instruments issued by such acquisition vehicle) as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request in connection with the formation of any acquisition vehicle, the formulation or submission of any credit bid or the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by such credit bid.
188
SECTION 8.09

date such Person became a Lender party hereto to the date such Person ceases being a Lender party hereto, for the benefit of, the Administrative Agent, and not, for the avoidance of doubt to or for the benefit of the Borrower or any other Loan
Party, that at least one of the following is and will be true:
(i) such Lender is not using “plan assets”
(within the meaning of Section 3(42) of ERISA or otherwise) of one or more Benefit Plans with respect to such Lender’s entrance into, or participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the
Commitments or this Agreement,
(ii) the transaction exemption set forth in one or more PTEs, such as
PTE 84-14
(a class exemption for certain transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers),

transactions involving insurance company general accounts),
PTE 90-1
(a class exemption for certain transactions involving insurance company pooled separate accounts),
PTE 91-38
(a class exemption for certain transactions involving bank collective investment funds) or
PTE 96-23
(a class exemption for certain transactions
determined by
in-house
asset managers), is applicable, and the conditions of such exemption have been satisfied, with respect to such Lender’s entrance into, participation in, administration of and
performance of the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments and this Agreement,
(iii) (A) such Lender is an
investment fund managed by a “Qualified Professional Asset Manager” (within the meaning of Part VI of
PTE 84-14),
(B) such Qualified Professional Asset Manager made the investment
decision on behalf of such Lender to enter into, participate in, administer and perform the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments and this Agreement, (C) the entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the
Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments and this Agreement satisfies the requirements of
sub-sections (b)
through (k) of Part I of
PTE 84-14
and (D) to the best knowledge of such Lender, the requirements of subsection (a) of Part I of
PTE 84-14
are satisfied with respect to such Lender’s entrance into, participation in,
administration of and performance of the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments and this Agreement, or
(iv) such
other representation, warranty and covenant as may be agreed in writing between the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion and such Lender.
In
addition, unless Section 8.09(a)(i) is true with respect to a Lender or such Lender has provided another representation, warranty and covenant as provided in Section 8.09(a)(iv), such Lender further (x) represents and warrants, as of
the date such Person became a Lender party hereto, to, and (y) covenants, from the date such Person became a Lender party hereto to the date such Person ceases being a Lender party hereto, for the benefit of, the Administrative Agent, each
Arranger and their respective Affiliates, and not, for the avoidance of doubt, to or for the benefit of the Borrower or any other Loan Party, that the Administrative Agent is not a fiduciary with respect to the assets of such Lender involved in such
Lender’s entrance into, participation in, administration of and performance of the Loans, the Letters of Credit, the Commitments and this Agreement (including in connection with the reservation or exercise of any rights by the Administrative
Agent under this Agreement, any Loan Document or any documents related hereto or thereto).
189
SECTION 8.10
Withholding Tax
. To the extent required by any applicable law, the
Administrative Agent may withhold from any payment to any Lender an amount equivalent to any applicable withholding Tax. Each Lender shall severally indemnify the Administrative Agent, within 10 days after demand therefor, for (i) any
Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the Loan Parties has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Loan Parties to do so),
(ii) any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 9.04(c)(i) relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (iii) any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each
case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the
relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set
off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement, any other Loan Document or otherwise against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this Section 8.10. For purposes of this Section 8.10,
the term “Lender” includes any Issuing Bank and any Swingline Lender. The agreements in this Section 8.10 shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement
of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all obligations under any Loan Document.

SECTION 9.02
Waivers; Amendments
.
(a) No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank, the Collateral Agent, the Swingline Lender or any other Lender in
exercising any right or power hereunder or under any other Loan Document shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or
power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank, the Collateral Agent, the Swingline Lender and the other Lenders hereunder and
under the other Loan Documents are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any departure by any Loan Party therefrom shall in any event
be effective unless the same shall be permitted by Section 9.02(b), and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
making of a Loan or issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default or Event of Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any Lender, the Collateral Agent, the Swingline Lender or any Issuing Bank may
have had notice or knowledge of such Default or Event of Default at the time.
(b) Except as provided in Section 2.14,
Section 2.20 and Section 2.21, or any provision governing Refinancing Indebtedness or with respect to an Additional Credit Extension Amendment (or to give effect to any restatement of this Agreement, the substantive terms of which are
otherwise permitted hereby), and except as provided in clauses (i) through (x) of the proviso in this Section 9.02(b), neither this Agreement nor any other Loan Document (other than any fee
192
letter (including the Fee Letter), which, in each case, may be waived, amended or modified as expressly set forth therein) nor any provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified
except, in the case of this Agreement, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by Holdings, the Borrower and the Required Lenders or, in the case of any other Loan Document, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing
entered into by the Administrative Agent and the Loan Party or Loan Parties that are parties thereto, in each case with the consent of the Required Lenders;
provided
that no such agreement shall:
(i) increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written consent of such Lender (but not the Required Lenders) (it being
understood that a waiver of any condition precedent set forth in Section 4.02 or of any Default or mandatory prepayment or mandatory reduction of any Commitments shall not constitute an increase of any Commitment of any Lender),
(ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees
payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender directly and adversely affected thereby (but not the Required Lenders), it being understood that any change to the definition of “Total Net Leverage Ratio” or the component
definitions thereof shall not constitute a reduction in any rate of interest nor shall a waiver of any Default, Event of Default or mandatory prepayment or mandatory reduction of any Commitments constitute any such reduction;
provided
that,
for the avoidance of doubt, only the consent of the Required Lenders shall be necessary to amend Section 2.13(d) or to waive any obligation of the Borrower to pay default interest thereunder,
(iii) postpone the stated final maturity of any Loan, or any scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Loan, the
required date of reimbursement of any LC Disbursement, or any scheduled date for the payment of any interest or fees payable hereunder, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the
written consent of each Lender directly and adversely affected thereby (but not the Required Lenders) (it being understood that a waiver of any Default, Event of Default or mandatory prepayment or mandatory reduction of any Commitment shall not
constitute a reduction, waiver, excuse or postponement),
(iv) change Section 2.18(b), (c) or (f) in a manner
that would by its terms alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby or order of payments specified therein, without the written consent of each Lender directly and adversely affected thereby (but not the required Lenders),
(v) change any of the provisions of this Section 9.02 or the percentage set forth in the definition of “Required
Lenders”, “Required Revolving Lenders”, “Required Term Lenders” or any other provision of any Loan Document specifying the number or percentage of Lenders (or Lenders of any Class) required to waive, amend or modify any
rights thereunder or make any determination or grant any consent thereunder, in each case, to reduce the number or percentage specified therein without the written consent of each Lender directly and adversely affected thereby (or each Lender of
such Class, as applicable),
193
(vi) release all or substantially all of the aggregate value of the
Guarantee under the Collateral Agreement (except as provided herein or in the Collateral Agreement), without the written consent of each Lender,
(vii) release all or substantially all the Collateral from the Liens of the Security Documents (except as provided herein or in
the Collateral Agreement), without the written consent of each Lender,

subordinate the Liens on all or substantially all of the Collateral securing the Obligations to Liens on all or substantially all of the Collateral securing any other Indebtedness for borrowed money (any such other Indebtedness for borrowed money to
which such Obligations or such Liens securing the Obligations, as applicable, are subordinated, “
Senior Indebtedness
”), in each case, unless each directly and adversely affected Lender has been offered a bona fide opportunity
(with five (5) Business Days to consider such opportunity) to fund or otherwise provide its pro rata share of the Senior Indebtedness on the same terms (other than bona fide backstop fees and similar fees and reimbursement of counsel fees and
other expenses in connection with the negotiation of the terms of such transaction; such fees and expenses, “
Ancillary Fees
”) as offered to all other providers (or their affiliates) of the Senior Indebtedness (it being understood
that the restrictions in this clause (ix) shall not (1) override the permission for Indebtedness and Liens expressly permitted by this Agreement as in effect on the Closing Date, (2) restrict an amendment to increase the maximum
permitted amount of any basket or exception existing on the Closing Date of Indebtedness that is secured by Liens on all or a portion of the Collateral on a senior basis to the Liens securing the Obligations or (3) apply to any
“debtor-in-possession”
facility;
provided
that (I) no
such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise adversely affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender (in their respective capacities as such) without the prior written consent of the
Administrative Agent, such Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as applicable, and (II) for the avoidance of doubt, the consent of the Required Lenders will not be required for any amendment, waiver or modification made pursuant to
clauses (i) through (x) of the preceding proviso. As it relates to rights of the Issuing Banks, (a) the definition of “Letter of Credit Sublimit” may be amended to increase the amount thereof to an amount equal to no more
than 50.0% of the aggregate principal amount of the Revolving Commitments (as in effect as of the date thereof) with only the written consent of the Issuing Banks, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower and (b) this Agreement may be amended
to adjust the mechanics related to the issuance of Letters of Credit, including mechanical changes relating to the existence of multiple Issuing Banks, with only the written consent of the applicable Issuing Bank and the Borrower, so long as the
obligations of the Revolving Lenders, if any, who have not executed such amendment, and if applicable, the other Issuing Banks, if any, who have not executed such amendment, are not adversely affected thereby. No Lender consent is required to effect
an Additional Credit Extension Amendment (except as expressly provided in Sections 2.20 or 2.21, as applicable). In connection with any proposed amendment, modification, waiver or termination (a “
Proposed Change
”)
requiring the consent of all Lenders or all adversely
194
affected Lenders, if the consent of the Required Lenders or 50.1% of the affected Lenders to such Proposed Change is obtained, but the consent to such Proposed Change of other Lenders whose
consent is required is not obtained (any such Lender whose consent is not obtained as described in this Section 9.02(b) being referred to as a “
Non-Consenting
Lender
”), then, at
the Borrower’s request, any Lender assignee or any other assignee that is consented to by the Administrative Agent to the extent required by Section 9.04 shall have the right to purchase from such
Non-Consenting
Lender, and such
Non-Consenting
Lender agrees that it shall, upon the Borrower’s request, sell and assign to such Lender or other assignee, at no
expense to such
Non-Consenting
Lender, all the Commitments and Loans of such
Non-Consenting
Lender for an amount equal to the principal balance of all Loans (and funded
participations in Swingline Loans and unreimbursed LC Disbursements) held by such
Non-Consenting
Lender and all accrued interest and fees with respect thereto through the date of sale (including amounts under
Sections 2.12, 2.15 and 2.17), such purchase and sale to be consummated pursuant to an executed Assignment and Assumption in accordance with Section 9.04(b) (which Assignment and Assumption need not be signed by such
Non-Consenting
Lender);
provided
that if any such
Non-Consenting
Lender does not execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent a duly executed Assignment and
Assumption reflecting such replacement within two (2) Business Days of the date on which the Lender assignee executes and delivers such Assignment and Assumption to such
Non-Consenting
Lender, then such
Non-Consenting
Lender shall be deemed to have executed and delivered such Assignment and Assumption without any action on the part of the
Non-Consenting
Lender.
(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 9.02(b), this Agreement may be amended (or amended and restated) with the written consent
of the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower (i) to add one or more additional credit facilities to this Agreement and to permit the extensions of credit from time to time thereunder and the accrued interest and fees in
respect thereof to share ratably in the benefits of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents with the Initial Term Loans and the Revolving Loans and the accrued interest and fees in respect thereof, and (ii) to include appropriately the
Lenders holding such credit facilities in any determination of the Required Lenders. In addition, this Agreement may be amended with the written consent of the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and the Lenders providing the relevant Replacement
Term Loans to permit the refinancing of all outstanding Term Loans of a Class with a replacement term loan tranche hereunder (the “
Replacement Term Loans
”);
provided
that (A) the aggregate principal amount of
such Replacement Term Loans shall not exceed the aggregate principal amount of such refinanced Term Loans (
plus
all accrued interest on such Indebtedness and the amount of all fees, commissions, discounts and expenses, including premiums
incurred in connection therewith and the amount of any existing commitments unutilized thereunder), (B) such Replacement Term Loans shall be subject to the MFN Protection, (C) the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of such Replacement Term
Loans shall not be shorter than the Weighted Average Life to Maturity of such refinanced Term Loans at the time of such refinancing (except to the extent of nominal amortization for periods where amortization has been eliminated as a result of
prepayment of the refinanced Term Loans) and (D) all other terms (taken as a whole) applicable to such Replacement Term Loans shall be substantially the same as, or less favorable to the Lenders providing such Replacement Term Loans than, those
applicable to such refinanced Term Loans, except to the extent necessary to provide for covenants and other terms applicable to any period after the Latest Maturity Date in effect immediately prior to such refinancing.
195
(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 9.02 to the contrary, (i) technical
and conforming modifications to the Loan Documents may be made with the consent of the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to the extent necessary (x) to integrate any Incremental Term Loans, any Incremental Revolving Commitments, any
Extended Term Loans or any Extended Revolving Credit Commitments or (y) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency and (ii) without the consent of any Lender or Issuing Bank, the Loan Parties and the Administrative Agent or
the Collateral Agent may (in their respective sole discretion, or shall, to the extent required by any Loan Document) enter into any (x) amendment, modification or waiver of any Loan Document, or enter into any new agreement or instrument, to
effect the granting, perfection, protection, expansion or enhancement of any security interest in any Collateral or additional property to become Collateral for the benefit of the Secured Parties or as required by local law to give effect to, or
protect any security interest for benefit of the Secured Parties, in any property or so that the security interests therein comply with applicable law or this Agreement or in each case to otherwise enhance the rights or benefits of any Lender under
any Loan Document or (y) any Intercreditor Agreement.
(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 9.02 to the contrary, if the
Administrative Agent and the Borrower shall have jointly identified an error, mistake, ambiguity, incorrect cross-reference or any error or omission, in each case, in any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any exhibit, schedule or other attachment to any Loan Document), then the Administrative Agent (acting in its sole discretion) and the Borrower or any other relevant Loan Party shall be permitted to amend such provision and such
amendment shall become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to any Loan Document. Notification of such amendment shall be made by the Administrative Agent to the Lenders promptly upon such amendment becoming effective.
(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 9.02 to the contrary, in connection with any determination as to whether the requisite
Lenders have (A) consented (or not consented) to any amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any other Loan Document or any departure by any Loan Party therefrom, (B) otherwise acted on any matter related to any Loan
Document, or (C) directed or required the Administrative Agent or Collateral Agent to undertake any action (or refrain from taking any action) with respect to or under any Loan Document, any Lender (other than any Lender (x) that is a
Regulated Bank or an Affiliate of a Regulated Bank or (y) that is a Revolving Lender as of the Closing Date or an Affiliate of such Revolving Lender) that, as a result of its interest in any total return swap, total rate of return swap, credit
default swap or other derivative contract (other than any such total return swap, total rate of return swap, credit default swap or other derivative contract entered into pursuant to bona fide market making activities), has a net short position with
respect to the Loans and/or Commitments (each, a “
Net Short Lender
”) shall have no right to vote any of its Loans and unused Commitments, without the prior written consent of the Borrower, and shall be automatically deemed to have
voted its interest as a Lender without discretion in the same proportion as the allocation of voting with respect to such matter by Lenders who are not Net Short Lenders.
196
(g) For purposes of determining whether a Lender has a “net short position” on
any date of determination: (i) derivative contracts with respect to any Loans and Commitments and such contracts that are the functional equivalent thereof shall be counted at the notional amount thereof in Dollars, (ii) derivative
contracts in respect of an index that includes any of the Loan Parties or any instrument issued or guaranteed by any of the Loan Parties shall not be deemed to create a short position with respect to any Loans and/or Commitments, so long as
(x) such index is not created, designed, administered or requested by such Lender and (y) the Loan Parties and any instrument issued or guaranteed by any of the Loan Parties, collectively, shall represent less than 5% of the weighted
average components of such index, (iii) derivative transactions that are documented using either the 2014 ISDA Credit Derivatives Definitions or the 2003 ISDA Credit Derivatives Definitions (collectively, the “
ISDA CDS
Definitions
”) shall be deemed to create a short position with respect to any Loans and/or Commitments if such Lender is a protection buyer or the equivalent thereof for such derivative transaction and (x) such Loans or Commitments are
a “Reference Obligation” under the terms of such derivative transaction (whether or not specified by name in the related documentation, included as a “Standard Reference Obligation” on the most recent list published by
Markit, if “Standard Reference Obligation” is specified as applicable in the relevant documentation or in any other manner), (y) such Loans or Commitments would be a “Deliverable Obligation” under the terms of such
derivative transaction or (z) any one or more Loan Parties (or their successors) is designated as a “Reference Entity” under the terms of such derivative transactions and (iv) credit derivative transactions or other derivatives
transactions not documented using the ISDA CDS Definitions shall be deemed to create a short position with respect to any Loans and/or Commitments if such transactions are functionally equivalent to a transaction that offers the Lender protection in
respect of such Loans or Commitments, or as to the credit quality of any of the Loan Parties other than, in each case, as part of an index so long as (x) such index is not created, designed, administered or requested by such Term Lender and
(y) the Loan Parties and any instrument issued or guaranteed by any of the Loan Parties, collectively, shall represent less than 5% of the weighted average components of such index. In connection with any such determination, each Term Lender
shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent in writing that it is a Net Short Lender, or shall otherwise be deemed to have represented and warranted to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent that it is not a Net Short Lender (it being
understood and agreed that the Borrower and the Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely on each such representation and deemed representation).
SECTION 9.03
Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver
.
(a) The Borrower shall pay or reimburse (i) all reasonable and documented
out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent and the Arrangers, including the reasonable and documented
out-of-pocket
fees, charges and disbursements of counsel for the Agents (within thirty (30) days of a written demand therefor, together with backup documentation
supporting such reimbursement request), in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery and administration of the Loan Documents or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions thereof (but, limited, in the case of legal fees
and expenses, to the reasonable and documented fees, disbursements and other charges of one external counsel to the Agents and the Arrangers, taken as a whole, and, if reasonably necessary, of one external local counsel in any material relevant
jurisdiction), (ii) all reasonable and documented
out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by any Issuing Bank in connection with the issuance, amendment, renewal or
extension of any Letter of Credit or any demand for payment thereunder and (iii) all reasonable and documented
out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by the Administrative
Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders (within thirty (30) days of a written demand therefor, together with backup documentation supporting such reimbursement request) incurred in connection with the enforcement of any rights or remedies
under this Agreement or the other Loan Documents (but,
197
limited, in the case of legal fees and expenses, to the reasonable and documented
out-of-pocket
fees, disbursements
and other charges of one external counsel to the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the Lenders, taken as a whole, and, if reasonably necessary, of one external local counsel in any material relevant jurisdiction and one additional external
counsel in each material relevant jurisdiction for each group of similarly situated parties, taken as a whole, in the event of a conflict of interest). If any Loan Party fails to pay when due any costs, expenses or other amounts payable by it
hereunder or under any Loan Document, and the Administrative Agent shall have provided the Borrower with not less than five (5) Business Days’ prior written notice thereof, the Administrative Agent may pay such amount on behalf of such
Loan Party in its discretion. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 9.03(a) shall not apply to Taxes, except any Taxes that represent costs, expenses, etc. arising from any
non-Tax
claim. For the
avoidance of doubt, the term “Lender” shall, for purposes of this Section 9.03(a), include any Issuing Bank and the Swingline Lender.
(b) The Borrower shall indemnify the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, each Agent, each Issuing Bank and each Lender, and each
Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an “
Indemnitee
”), and hold each Indemnitee harmless, from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities or
out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee (but, limited, in the case of advisor fees and expenses, to the reasonable and documented
out-of-pocket
fees, disbursements and other charges of one external counsel to the Indemnitees taken as a whole, and, if necessary, of one external local counsel to the
Indemnitees taken as a whole in any material relevant jurisdiction and one additional external counsel in each material relevant jurisdiction for each group of similarly situated parties, taken as a whole, in the event of a conflict) incurred in
connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of any Loan Document or any other agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the performance by the parties to the Loan Documents of their respective obligations thereunder or
the consummation of the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds therefrom (including any refusal by an Issuing Bank to honor a demand for payment under a Letter of
Credit if the documents presented in connection with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of such Letter of Credit), (iii) any actual or alleged presence, Release or threat of Release of Hazardous Materials on, at, under or from
any property currently owned, leased or operated by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or any actual or alleged Environmental Liability related in any way to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) any claim, litigation,
investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto;
provided
that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be
available to the extent that such liabilities, losses, damages, claims or
out-of-pocket
expenses resulted from (x) the gross negligence, bad faith or willful
misconduct of such Indemnitee or of any of its Related Parties, as determined by a final
non-appealable
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, (y) a material breach of any obligations under any
Loan Document by such Indemnitee or of any of its Related Parties, as determined by a final
non-appealable
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, or (z) any dispute solely among Indemnitees other
than any claims against an Indemnitee in its capacity or in fulfilling its role as an administrative agent or arranger or any similar role under this Agreement and other than any claims arising out of any act or omission of the Borrower or any of
its Affiliates (in the case of any such act or omission, as determined in a final
non-appealable
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction). All amounts due under this Section 9.03(b) shall be paid
within thirty (30) days after
198
written demand therefor (together with backup documentation supporting such reimbursement request);
provided
that the applicable Indemnitee shall promptly refund and return such amounts to
the extent that there is a final judicial determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnitee was not entitled to indemnification rights with respect to such payment pursuant to the express terms of this Section 9.03(b).
This Section 9.03(b) shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes that represent losses, claims, damages, etc. arising from any
non-Tax
claim. Payments under this Section 9.03(b) shall
be made by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the relevant Indemnitee. For the avoidance of doubt, the term “Lender” shall, for purposes of this Section 9.03(b) include any Issuing Bank and the Swingline
Lender. Should any proceeding involving an Indemnitee be settled, or if there is a judgment in any such investigation, litigation or proceeding, the Borrower shall indemnify and hold harmless such Indemnitee in the manner set forth above;
provided
that the Borrower shall not be liable for any settlement effected without the Borrower’s prior written consent.
(c)
To the extent that the Borrower fails to pay any amount required to be paid by it to the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, any Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender under Section 9.03(a) or (b), each Lender severally agrees to pay to
the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, such Issuing Bank or the Swingline Lender, as applicable, such Lender’s pro rata share (determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such
unpaid amount;
provided
that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as applicable, was incurred by or asserted against the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, such Issuing Bank or
the Swingline Lender in its capacity as such. For purposes hereof, a Lender’s “pro rata share” shall be determined based upon its share of the aggregate Revolving Exposures, outstanding Term Loans and unused Commitments at the
time.
(d) To the extent permitted by applicable law, (i) no party hereto shall assert, and each party hereto hereby waives, any
claim against any other party hereto the Administrative Agent, any Arranger, any Issuing Bank and any Lender, and any Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called a “
Lender-Related Person
”) and
the respective Affiliates of the foregoing, on any theory of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of, this Agreement or any
agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the Transactions, any Loan or Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof;
provided
that nothing in this Section 9.03(d) shall relieve the Borrower or any other Loan Party of any
obligation it may have to indemnify a Lender-Related Person, as provided in Section 9.03(b), against any special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages asserted against such Indemnitee by a third party and (ii) in the absence of
gross negligence, bad faith, material breach of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents, or willful misconduct on the part of any Lender-Related Person or any Related Parties (as finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction), the
Borrower and any Loan Party shall not assert and the Borrower and each Loan Party hereby waives, any claim against any Lender-Related Person for any liabilities arising from the use by others of information or other materials (including, without
limitation, any personal data) obtained through telecommunications, electronic or other information transmission systems (including the Internet and any Approved Electronic Platform).

Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary set forth herein, any assignment of any Loans to any Affiliated Lender shall also be subject to the

similar extensions of credit, any other fund that invests in bank loans and similar extensions of credit and is managed or advised by the same investment advisor as such Lender or by an Affiliate of such investment advisor, but in any event,
excluding any Disqualified Institution.
“
CLO
” means any entity (whether a corporation, partnership, trust or otherwise)
that is engaged in making, purchasing, holding or otherwise investing in bank loans and similar extensions of credit in the ordinary course and is administered or managed by a Lender or an Affiliate of such Lender.

specified in each Assignment and Assumption, the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the
assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering all the assigning
Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.17 and 9.03). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or
obligations under this Agreement that does not comply with this Section 9.04 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with Section 9.04(c).
(iv) The Administrative Agent, acting solely for this purpose as an agent of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its
offices a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of, and principal amount and stated interest of the Loans and LC Disbursements owing
to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (a “
Register
”). The entries in the applicable Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks
and the Lenders shall treat each Person whose name is recorded in the applicable Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender for all purposes of the Loan Documents, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. Each Register shall be available for
inspection by the Borrower, and solely with respect to their respective interests by the Issuing Banks and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice. No assignment shall be effective unless recorded in the
Register. The parties hereto agree and intend that the Loans shall be treated as being in “registered form” for the purposes of the Code (including Sections 163(f), 871(h)(2), and 881(c)(2) of the Code).
202
(v) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption executed
by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee’s completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in Section 9.04(b) and any written
consent to such assignment required by Section 9.04(b), the Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the information contained therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this
Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this clause (v). It is intended that each Commitment, Loan or other obligation is at all times maintained in “registered form” within the meaning of
Sections 163(f), 165(j), 871(h)(2), 881(c)(2) and 4701 of the Code.
(c) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks or the Swingline Lender, sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (excluding any Disqualified Institution) (a “

that (x) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (y) such Lender
shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such obligations and (z) the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Banks and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such
Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this
Agreement and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement;
provided
that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any
amendment, modification or waiver described in clauses (i) through (iv) of the first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that adversely and disproportionately affects such Participant.
(i) Each Lender that sells a participation shall, acting solely for this purpose as a
non-fiduciary
agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and related interest amounts) of each Participant’s
interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the “
Participant Register
”);
provided
that no Lender shall have any obligation to disclose all or any portion of the Participant Register to any
Person (including the identity of any Participant or any information relating to a Participant’s interest in any Commitments, Loans or its other obligations under this Agreement) except to the extent that the relevant parties, acting
reasonably and in good faith, determine that such disclosure is necessary to establish that such Commitment, Loan or other obligation is at all times maintained in registered form under
Section 5f.103-1(c)
of the United States Treasury Regulations. The entries in the Participant Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Lender maintaining such Participant Register shall
treat each person whose name is recorded in the Participant Register as the owner of the participation in question for all purposes of this Agreement notwithstanding any notice to the contrary.
(ii) The Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15 and 2.17 (subject to the
requirements and limitations of such Sections;
provided
that any forms required to be provided by any Participant pursuant to Section 2.17(e) shall be provided solely to the applicable Lender) to the same extent as if it were a Lender
and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to Section 9.04(b);
provided
,
further
, that a Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under Section 2.15 or 2.17 than the applicable Lender would
have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant unless the sale of the participation
203
to such Participant is made with the Borrower’s prior written consent with respect to such Participant’s rights under Sections 2.15 and 2.17 (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.08 as though it were a Lender;
provided
that such Participant shall be subject to
Section 2.17(e) and Section 2.18(c) as though it were a Lender.
(iii) Any Lender may at any time pledge, assign
or grant a security interest in all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section 9.04 shall not apply to any such pledge, assignment or grant of a security
interest;
provided
that no such pledge, assignment or grant of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
(iv) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no Lender will assign its rights and obligations under this
Agreement, or sell participations in its rights and/or obligations under this Agreement, to any Person who is (i) a Disqualified Institution, (ii) a natural person, (iii) a Person listed on the Specially Designated Nationals and
Blocked Persons List maintained by OFAC and/or on any other similar list maintained by OFAC pursuant to any authorizing statute, executive order or regulation, (iv) a Person either (A) included within the term “designated
national” as defined in the Cuban Assets Control Regulations, 31 C.F.R. Part 515 or (B) designated under Section 1(a), 1(b), 1(c) or 1(d) of Executive Order No. 13224, 66 Fed. Reg. 49079 (published
September 25, 2001) or similarly designated under any related enabling legislation or any other similar executive orders, (v) a Defaulting Lender or (vi) except as provided in Section 9.04(d), the Borrower or any of its
Affiliates.
(d) (i) Notwithstanding anything else to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any Lender may assign all
or a portion of its Term Loans to a Person who is or will become, after such assignment, an Affiliated Lender in accordance with Section 9.04(b) and this Section 9.04(d);
provided
that:
(A) the assigning Lender and any
Non-Debt
Fund Affiliate purchasing such Lender’s
Term Loans, as applicable, shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an assignment agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit J hereto (an “
Affiliated Lender Assignment and Assumption
”) in lieu of an
Assignment and Assumption;
(B) for the avoidance of doubt, Lenders shall not be permitted to assign Revolving Commitments,
Revolving Loans, Extended Revolving Credit Commitments, Incremental Revolving Commitments, Incremental Revolving Loans or Refinancing Revolving Commitments to any Affiliated Lender;
(C) no
Non-Debt
Fund Affiliate shall be permitted to hold Term Loans pursuant to this
Section 9.04(d), if
(i) Non-Debt
Fund Affiliates in the aggregate would own in excess of 25.0% of the Term Loans of any Class then outstanding or (ii) there would be more than two
(2) Non-Debt
Fund Affiliates holding Term Loans of any Class then outstanding; and
204
(D) any such
Non-Debt
Fund Affiliate
shall not be required to represent or warrant to any party that it does not possess material
non-public
information with respect to the Borrower and its Subsidiaries or the securities of any of them, and all
parties to the relevant transactions may render customary “big boy” letters.
(ii) Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, no
Non-Debt
Fund Affiliate shall have any right to (A) attend (including by telephone) any meeting or discussions (or portion thereof) among the Administrative Agent or any
Lender to which representatives of the Loan Parties are not invited, (B) receive any information or material prepared by the Administrative Agent or any Lender or any communication by or among the Administrative Agent and/or one or more
Lenders, except to the extent such information or materials have been made available to any Loan Party or its representatives (and in any case, other than the right to receive notices of prepayments and other administrative notices in respect of its
Loans required to be delivered to Lenders pursuant to Article II), or (C) make or bring (or participate in, other than as a passive participant in or recipient of its pro rata benefits of) any claim, in its capacity as a Lender, against
the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any other Lender with respect to any duties or obligations or alleged duties or obligations of such Agent or any other such Lender under the Loan Documents.
(iii) By its acquisition of Term Loans, a
Non-Debt
Fund Affiliate (in its capacity as
such) shall be deemed to have acknowledged and agreed that if a case under Title 11 of the United States Code is commenced against any Loan Party, such Loan Party shall provide (and each
Non-Debt
Fund
Affiliate (in its capacity as such) hereby agrees) that (A) such
Non-Debt
Fund Affiliate (in its capacity as such) shall not take any step or action in such case to object to, impede, or delay the
exercise of any right or the taking of any action by the Administrative Agent (or the taking of any action by a third party that is supported by Administrative Agent) in relation to such
Non-Debt
Fund
Affiliates’ claim with respect to its Loans (including, without limitation, objecting to any debtor in possession financing, use of cash collateral, grant of adequate protection, sale or disposition, compromise, or plan of reorganization) so
long as such
Non-Debt
Fund Affiliate is treated in connection with such exercise or action on the same or better terms as the other Lenders, and (B) the vote of any
Non-Debt
Fund Affiliate (in its capacity as a Lender) with respect to any plan of reorganization of such Loan Party shall not be counted except that such
Non-Debt
Fund
Affiliate’s vote (in its capacity as a Lender) may be counted to the extent any such plan of reorganization proposes to treat the Obligations held by such
Non-Debt
Fund Affiliate in a manner that is less
favorable to such
Non-Debt
Fund Affiliate than the proposed treatment of similar Obligations held by Lenders that are not Affiliates of the Borrower. Each
Non-Debt
Fund
Affiliate hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent (such appointment being coupled with an interest) as such
Non-Debt
Fund Affiliate’s
attorney-in-fact,
with full authority in the place and stead of such
Non-Debt
Fund Affiliate and in the name of such
Non-Debt
Fund Affiliate (solely in respect of Loans and participations therein and not in respect of any other claim or status such Non-
205
Debt Fund Affiliate may otherwise have) from time to time in the Administrative Agent’s discretion to take any action and to execute any instrument that the Administrative Agent may deem
reasonably necessary to carry out the provisions of this clause (iii), in each case, solely to the extent such
Non-Debt
Fund Affiliate has not taken such action or executed such instrument within ten
(10) Business Days after the Administrative Agent’s written request for such
Non-Debt
Fund Affiliate to do so.
(e) Notwithstanding anything in Section 9.02 or the definition of “Required Lenders” to the contrary, for purposes of
determining whether the Required Lenders or any other requisite Class vote required by this Agreement have (i) consented (or not consented) to any amendment, modification, waiver, consent or other action with respect to any of the terms of
any Loan Document or any departure by any Loan Party therefrom, (ii) otherwise acted on any matter related to any Loan Document, or (iii) directed or required the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent or any Lender to undertake any
action (or refrain from taking any action) with respect to or under any Loan Document, (A) all Term Loans held by any
Non-Debt
Fund Affiliate shall be deemed to be not outstanding for all purposes of
calculating whether the Required Lenders (or requisite vote of any Class of Lenders) have taken any actions and (B) the aggregate amount of Term Loans held by Debt Fund Affiliates will be excluded to the extent in excess of 49.0% of the
amount required to constitute “Required Lenders”;
provided
that (v) the commitment of any Non-Debt Fund Affiliate shall not be increased, (w) the due date for payments of interest, fees and scheduled payments of
principal owed to any
Non-Debt
Fund Affiliate shall not be extended, (x) the amounts owing to any
Non-Debt
Fund Affiliate will not be reduced and (y) any
amendment that results in a disproportionate and adverse effect on a
Non-Debt
Fund Affiliate, in relation to all
non-Affiliated
Lenders or otherwise requires the consent
of each Lender or each affected Lender shall not be effected or (z) the “sacred rights” of any
Non-Debt
Fund Affiliate shall not be amended or modified, in each instance in clauses (i) to
(iii) above, without the consent of such
Non-Debt
Fund Affiliate.
(f) The Borrower shall
maintain at its offices a copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it by any
Non-Debt
Fund Affiliate (the “
Affiliated Lender Register
”). Each
Non-Debt
Fund Affiliate shall advise the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of any proposed disposition of Term Loans by such Lender. Additionally, if any Lender becomes a
Non-Debt
Fund Affiliate at a time that such Lender holds any Term Loans, such Lender shall promptly advise the Borrower and the Administrative Agent that such Lender is a
Non-Debt
Fund Affiliate. Copies of the Affiliated Lender Register shall be provided to the Administrative Agent and the
Non-Debt
Fund Affiliate upon request.
Notwithstanding the foregoing if at any time (if applicable, after giving effect to any proposed assignment to a
Non-Debt
Fund Affiliate), all
Non-Debt
Fund Affiliates
own or would, in the aggregate own more than 25.0% of the principal amount of any Class of Term Loans then outstanding: (i) any proposed pending assignment to a
Non-Debt
Fund Affiliate that would
cause such threshold to be exceeded shall not become effective or be recorded in the Affiliated Lender Register and (ii) if such threshold is otherwise exceeded (whether as a result of a Lender becoming a
Non-Debt
Fund Affiliate after it has acquired Term Loans, due to repayments, prepayments or Declined Proceeds, or otherwise), such
Non-Debt
Fund Affiliate shall assign
sufficient Term Loans of such Class so that
Non-Debt
Fund Affiliates in the aggregate own less than 25.0% of the aggregate principal amount of Term Loans of such Class then outstanding. The
Administrative Agent may conclusively rely upon the Affiliated Lender Register in connection with any amendment or waiver hereunder and shall not have any responsibility for monitoring any acquisition or disposition of Term Loans by any
Non-Debt
Fund Affiliate or for any losses suffered by any Person as a result of any purported assignment to or from an Affiliated Lender.
206
(g) The Administrative Agent shall not be responsible or have any liability for, or have any
duty to ascertain, inquire into, monitor or enforce, compliance with the provisions hereof relating to Disqualified Institutions. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent shall not (x) be obligated to
ascertain, monitor or inquire as to whether any Lender or Participant or prospective Lender or Participant is a Disqualified Institution or (y) have any liability with respect to or arising out of any assignment or participation of Loans or
Commitments, or disclosure of confidential information, to any Disqualified Institution (absent a finding of bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct in a final and
non-appealable
judgment of a court
of competent jurisdiction).
SECTION 9.05
Survival
. All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Loan
Parties in the Loan Documents and in the certificates or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan Document shall have independent significance and be considered to have been relied upon by the
other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and the making of any Loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and
notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default, any Event of Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall
continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid or any Letter of Credit is outstanding (other than contingent
indemnification obligations as to which no claim has been asserted, obligations and liabilities under Cash Management Agreements and Secured Hedge Agreements and any Letter of Credit if the outstanding amount of the L/C Exposure related thereto has
been cash collateralized, back-stopped by a letter of credit in form and substance, and issued by a letter of credit issuer, reasonably satisfactory to the applicable Issuing Bank and in a face amount equal to 103% of the outstanding amount of the
applicable L/C Exposure in respect thereof, or deemed reissued under another agreement reasonably acceptable to the applicable Issuing Bank) and so long as the Commitments have not expired or terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.15, 2.17
and 9.03 and Article VIII shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit and the
Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.
SECTION 9.06
Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness
.
(a) This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which shall
constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any separate letter agreements with respect to fees payable to the Administrative Agent constitute the
entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement
shall become effective when it shall have been
207
executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto,
and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns. In the event of a conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and those of any other Loan Document, the
provisions of this Agreement shall control. Each Loan Document was drafted with the joint participation of the respective parties thereto and shall be construed neither against nor in favor of any party, but rather in accordance with the fair
meaning thereof.
(b) Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of (x) this Agreement, (y) any other Loan Document
and/or (z) any document, amendment, approval, consent, information, notice (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any notice delivered pursuant to Section 9.01), certificate, request, statement, disclosure or authorization related to this
Agreement, any other Loan Document and/or the transactions contemplated hereby and/or thereby (each an “
Ancillary Document
”) that is an Electronic Signature transmitted by telecopy, emailed pdf. or any other electronic means
that reproduces an image of an actual executed signature page shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement, such other Loan Document or such Ancillary Document, as applicable. The words “execution,”
“signed,” “signature,” “delivery,” and words of like import in or relating to this Agreement, any other Loan Document and/or any Ancillary Document shall be deemed to include Electronic Signatures, deliveries or
the keeping of records in any electronic form (including deliveries by telecopy, emailed pdf. or any other electronic means that reproduces an image of an actual executed signature page), each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity and
enforceability as a manually executed signature, physical delivery thereof or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be;
provided
that nothing herein shall require the Administrative Agent to accept Electronic
Signatures in any form or format without its prior written consent and pursuant to procedures approved by it;
provided
,
further
, without limiting the foregoing, (i) to the extent the Administrative Agent has agreed to accept any
Electronic Signature, the Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders shall be entitled to rely in good faith on such Electronic Signature purportedly given by or on behalf of the Borrower or any other Loan Party without further verification
thereof and without any obligation to review the appearance or form of any such Electronic signature and (ii) upon the request of the Administrative Agent or any Lender, any Electronic Signature shall be promptly followed by a manually executed
counterpart. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each party hereto hereby (i) agrees that, for all purposes, including without limitation, in connection with any workout, restructuring, enforcement of remedies, bankruptcy
proceedings or litigation among the Administrative Agent, the Lenders, the Borrower and the Loan Parties, Electronic Signatures transmitted by telecopy, emailed pdf. or any other electronic means that reproduces an image of an actual executed
signature page and/or any electronic images of this Agreement, any other Loan Document and/or any Ancillary Document shall have the same legal effect, validity and enforceability as any paper original, (ii) agrees that any other party hereto
may, at its option, create one or more copies of this Agreement, any other Loan Document and/or any Ancillary Document in the form of an imaged electronic record in any format, which shall be deemed created in the ordinary course of such
Person’s business, and destroy the original paper document (and all such electronic records shall be considered an original for all purposes and shall have the same legal effect, validity and enforceability as a paper record),
(iii) waives any argument, defense or right to contest the legal effect, validity or enforceability of this Agreement, any other Loan Document and/or any Ancillary Document based solely on the lack of paper original copies
208
of this Agreement, such other Loan Document and/or such Ancillary Document, respectively, including with respect to any signature pages thereto, and (iv) waives any claim against any other
party hereto and any Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons, for any liabilities arising solely from such other Person’s reliance on or use of Electronic Signatures and/or transmissions by telecopy, emailed pdf. or any other electronic
means that reproduces an image of an actual executed signature page, including any liabilities arising as a result of the failure of any other party hereto or its Related Parties to use any available security measures in connection with the
execution, delivery or transmission of any Electronic Signature, except to the extent such liabilities result from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Persons (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final
and
non-appealable
decision).
SECTION 9.07
Severability
. Any provision of this Agreement
held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the
remaining provisions hereof, and the invalidity of a particular provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction.
SECTION 9.08
Right of Setoff
. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is
hereby authorized at any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) (other than payroll, escrow, trust and tax accounts) at
any time held and other obligations at any time owing by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Borrower against any of and all the obligations of the Borrower now or hereafter existing under this Agreement held by such
Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although such obligations may be unmatured. The applicable Lender shall notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of such setoff or
application;
provided
that any failure to give or any delay in giving such notice to the Borrower shall not affect the validity of any such setoff or application under this Section 9.08. The rights of each Lender under this
Section 9.08 are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have.

Information, except that Information may be disclosed (a) to it and its Affiliates and its and its Affiliates’ respective directors, officers, employees, legal counsel, independent auditors and other experts, professionals, advisors or
agents on a need to know basis (it being understood that (x) the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential and (y) the
Agents, Issuing Banks and the Lenders shall be liable for any breach of this Section 9.12 by any of the Persons described in this clause (a)), (b) to the extent requested or demanded by any Governmental Authority or self-regulatory

examination conducted by bank accountants or a regulatory authority
210
exercising examination or regulatory authority or at the request of a regulatory authority or any self-regulatory authority having or asserting jurisdiction over such Person) prior to such
disclosure unless such notification is prohibited by law, rule or regulation, (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process or order of any court or administrative agency;
provided
that the Administrative Agent, Issuing Bank or Lender, as applicable, agrees that it will notify the Borrower as soon as practicable in the event of any such disclosure by such Person (other than with respect to any routine audit or
examination conducted by bank accountants or a regulatory authority exercising examination or regulatory authority or at the request of a regulatory authority or any self-regulatory authority having or asserting jurisdiction over such Person) prior
to such disclosure unless such notification is prohibited by law, rule or regulation, (d) to any other party to this Agreement, (e) to any credit insurer or reinsurer with respect to the Loan Document Obligations, (f) subject to an

in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any swap or derivative transaction relating to the Borrower and its obligations;
provided
that no such
disclosure shall be made to any Disqualified Institution or, to the extent the respective Lender has actual knowledge thereof, to any other Person with respect to whom the Borrower has affirmatively denied to provide consent to assignment in
accordance with Section 9.04(b), (g) with the written consent of the Borrower, (h) to any rating agency when required by it on a customary basis and after consultation with the Borrower (it being understood that, prior to any such
disclosure, such rating agency shall undertake to preserve the confidentiality of any Information relating to Loan Parties and their Subsidiaries received by it from such Lender), (i) in connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder,
under any other Loan Document or the enforcement of its rights hereunder or thereunder, (j) for purposes of establishing a “due diligence” defense, (k) to the extent such Information is independently developed by such Person or

or fiduciary obligations substantially the same as those contained in this Section 9.12. For the purposes of this Section 9.12, the term “
Information
” means all information received from or on behalf of Holdings, the
Borrower or any other Loan Party relating to Holdings or to the Borrower, their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates, and their respective businesses, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Bank,
any Lender or any of their respective Affiliates on a
non-confidential
basis prior to disclosure by or on behalf of Holdings or the Borrower other than as a result of a breach of this Section 9.12. Any
Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section 9.12 shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the
confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information and has otherwise not made a disclosure of such information in contravention of this Section 9.12.
211
For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 9.12 shall prohibit any individual
from voluntarily disclosing or providing any Information to any governmental, regulatory or self-regulatory organization (any such entity, a “
Regulatory Authority
”) to the extent that any such prohibition on disclosure set forth
in this Section 9.12 shall be prohibited by the laws or regulations applicable to such Regulatory Authority.
SECTION 9.13
Interest Rate Limitation

law (collectively, the “
Charges
”), shall exceed the maximum lawful rate (the “
Maximum Rate
”) that may be contracted for, charged, taken, received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan in accordance
with applicable law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan hereunder, together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges that would have been
payable in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a result of the operation of this Section 9.13 shall be cumulated and the interest and Charges payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be increased (but not above
the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Rate to the date of repayment, shall have been received by such Lender.
SECTION 9.14
USA Patriot Act

written consent to the release of the security interest granted hereby in any Collateral pursuant to Section 9.02, the security interest in such Collateral shall be automatically released, subject to the terms of any applicable Intercreditor
Agreement.
(b) Without limiting Section 7.12 of the Collateral Agreement, upon the addition of a Succeeding Holdings and
satisfaction by such Succeeding Holdings of the Collateral and Guarantee Requirement, the prior Holdings shall be automatically released from all of its obligations under the Security Documents. Following the consummation of a Qualified IPO,
Holdings shall be, automatically, and without further action of any Person, released from its obligations as “Holdings” hereunder;
provided
that, following such Qualified IPO, Holdings shall comply with the Collateral and
Guarantee Requirement as a Restricted Subsidiary of the Borrower.

(c) Without limiting Section 7.12 of the Collateral Agreement, upon any Subsidiary of
the Borrower (i) becoming an Excluded Subsidiary, (ii) having its Equity Interests disposed of in a transaction permitted under this Agreement to a Person that is not a Loan Party (including pursuant to a valid waiver or consent) or
(iii) being designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, such Subsidiary shall be automatically released from its Guarantee of any Obligation;
provided
,
however
, that no Subsidiary Guarantor will be released from its Guarantee of the
Obligations solely as a result of it becoming a
non-wholly
owned Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to the foregoing clause (i) pursuant to a transaction the primary purpose of which is to cause such
Guarantor to be excluded from the guarantee requirement by virtue of no longer being a wholly-owned Restricted Subsidiary.
(d) Upon
request by the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent at any time, the Required Lenders will confirm in writing the authority of the Collateral Agent to release or subordinate its interest in particular property and of the Administrative Agent
to release any Guarantor from its obligations hereunder pursuant to this Section 9.15. In each case as specified in this Section 9.15, the Administrative Agent and Collateral Agent, as applicable, will (and each Lender irrevocably
authorizes and instructs the Administrative Agent to), at the Borrower’s expense, execute and deliver to the applicable Loan Party such documents as such Loan Party may reasonably request to evidence the release of such item of Collateral from
the assignment and security interest granted under the Security Documents or to subordinate its interest in such item, or to evidence the release of such Guarantor from its obligations under the Guarantees under the Loan Documents, in each case, in
accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents and this Section 9.15.
SECTION 9.16
No Fiduciary Duty
. In connection with all
aspects of each transaction contemplated by this Agreement, the Borrower acknowledges and agrees, and acknowledges the other Loan Parties’ understanding, that (i) each transaction contemplated by this Agreement is an
arm’s-length
commercial transaction between the Loan Parties, on the one hand, and the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, on the other hand, (ii) in connection with each such transaction and the
process leading thereto, the Administrative Agent, the Lenders and the Arrangers will act solely as principals and not as agents or fiduciaries of the Loan Parties or any of their stockholders, affiliates, creditors, employees or any other party,
(iii) none of the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Arranger will assume an advisory or fiduciary responsibility in favor of the Borrower or any of its Affiliates with respect to any of the debt transactions contemplated hereby or the
process leading thereto (irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Arranger has advised or is currently advising any Loan Party on other matters) and none of the Administrative Agent nor any Lender nor any Arranger will
have any obligation to any Loan Party or any of its Affiliates with respect to the debt transactions contemplated in this Agreement except the obligations expressly set forth herein, (iv) the Administrative Agent and each Lender may be engaged
in a broad range of transactions that involve interests that differ from those of the Loan Parties and their Affiliates, and (v) none of the Administrative Agent or any Lender has provided or will provide any legal, accounting, regulatory or
tax advice with respect to any of the transactions contemplated hereby and each of the Loan Parties has consulted and will consult its own legal, accounting, regulatory, and tax advisors to the extent it deems appropriate. The Borrower agrees that
the Loan Parties shall not assert any claims in respect of this Agreement that any Loan Party may have against the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any Arranger based on any breach or alleged breach of fiduciary duty in respect of this Agreement.
213
SECTION 9.17
Intercreditor Agreements Govern
. Each of the Administrative Agent, the
Collateral Agent, each Secured Party and each Lender (a) hereby agrees that it will be bound by and will take no actions contrary to the provisions of any Intercreditor Agreement entered into pursuant to the terms hereof and (b) hereby
authorizes and instructs the Administrative Agent and the Collateral Agent to enter into each Intercreditor Agreement (including any Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement and any Pari Intercreditor Agreement) entered into pursuant to the terms hereof
and to subject the Liens securing the Obligations to the provisions thereof. In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the provisions of each Intercreditor Agreement (including any Junior Lien Intercreditor Agreement and/or any Pari
Intercreditor Agreement) and this Agreement, the provisions of such Intercreditor Agreement shall control in all respects.
SECTION 9.18

(a)
EACH LENDER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT INFORMATION (AS
DEFINED IN SECTION

SECURITIES, AND CONFIRMS THAT IT HAS DEVELOPED COMPLIANCE PROCEDURES REGARDING THE USE OF MATERIAL

SECTION 9.19
Acknowledgment and Consent to
Bail-In
of Affected Financial Institutions
.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties, each party hereto acknowledges that any liability of any Affected Financial Institution arising under any
Loan Document, to the extent such liability is unsecured, may be subject to the Write-Down and Conversion Powers of the applicable Resolution Authority and agrees and consents to, and acknowledges and agrees to be bound by:
(a) the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by the applicable Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder
which may be payable to it by any party hereto that is an Affected Financial Institution; and
214
(b) the effects of any
Bail-in
Action on any such
liability, including, if applicable:
(i) a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability;
(ii) a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other instruments of ownership in such Affected
Financial Institution, its parent entity, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any rights with respect to any such
liability under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; or
(iii) the variation of the terms of such liability in
connection with the exercise of the Write-Down and Conversion Powers of the applicable Resolution Authority.
SECTION 9.20
[Reserved]
.
SECTION 9.21
[Reserved]
.
SECTION 9.22
Acknowledgement Regarding Any Supported QFCs
. To the extent that the Loan Documents provide support, through a guarantee
or otherwise, for Swap Agreements or any other agreement or instrument that is a QFC (such support, “
QFC Credit Support
” and each such QFC a “
Supported QFC
”), the parties acknowledge and agree as follows
with respect to the resolution power of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act and Title II of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (together with the regulations promulgated
thereunder, the “
U.S. Special Resolution Regimes
”) in respect of such Supported QFC and QFC Credit Support (with the provisions below applicable notwithstanding that the Loan Documents and any Supported QFC may in fact be
stated to be governed by the laws of the State of New York and/or of the United States or any other state of the United States):
In the
event a Covered Entity that is party to a Supported QFC (each, a “
Covered Party
”) becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, the transfer of such Supported QFC and the benefit of such QFC Credit
Support (and any interest and obligation in or under such Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support, and any rights in property securing such Supported QFC or such QFC Credit Support) from such Covered Party will be effective to the same extent as
the transfer would be effective under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and such QFC Credit Support (and any such interest, obligation and rights in property) were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the
United States. In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents that might
215
otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could
be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States. Without limitation of the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that
rights and remedies of the parties with respect to a Defaulting Lender shall in no event affect the rights of any Covered Party with respect to a Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support.
SECTION 9.23
Judgment Currency
. If, for the purposes of obtaining judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum due hereunder
or under any other Loan Document in one currency into another currency, the rate of exchange used shall be that at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Administrative Agent could purchase the first currency with such other currency
on the Business Day preceding that on which final judgment is given. The obligation of the Borrower in respect of any such sum due from it to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, as the case may be, hereunder or under the other Loan Documents
shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the “
Judgment Currency
”) other than that in which such sum is denominated in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement (the “
Agreement
Currency
”), be discharged only to the extent that on the Business Day following receipt by the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, of any sum adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Administrative Agent or
such Lender, as the case may be, may in accordance with normal banking procedures purchase the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the
Administrative Agent or any Lender, as the case may be, from the Borrower in the Agreement Currency, the Borrower agrees, as a separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the Administrative Agent or such Lender, as the
case may be, against such loss. If the amount of the Agreement Currency so purchased is greater than the sum originally due to the Administrative Agent or any Lender, as the case may be, in such Agreement Currency, the Administrative Agent or such
Lender, as the case may be, agrees to return the amount of any excess to the Borrower (or to any other Person who may be entitled thereto under applicable law).
