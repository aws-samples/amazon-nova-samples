provided
,
however
, that if such transfer cannot be so effected by notation on one or more existing Global Notes (whether because no Global Notes bearing each legend, if any, required by
Section 2.09

Section 2.02

provided
,
however
, that, without limiting
Section 2.10(E)

,
however
, that, to the extent that the Company’s obligations pursuant to this
Section 4.04
conflict with any law or regulation that is applicable to the Company and enacted after the Issue Date, the Company’s compliance with such law or regulation will not be considered to be a Default of such obligations; rather, the Company will be deemed to be in compliance with such obligations if the Company complies with its obligation to effect Optional Repurchases in accordance with this
Section 4.04
, modified as necessary by the Company in good faith to permit compliance with such law or regulation.

(C)
When Notes May Be Converted
.
(i)
Generally
. Subject to
Section 5.01(C)(ii)
, a Note may be converted only in the following circumstances:
(1)
Conversion upon Satisfaction of Sale Price Condition
. Before the Close of Business on the Business Day immediately before August 1, 2031, a Holder may convert its Notes during any calendar quarter (and only during such calendar quarter) commencing after the calendar quarter ending on March 31, 2026, if the Last Reported Sale Price per share of Common Stock exceeds one hundred and thirty percent (130%) of the Conversion Price for each of at least twenty (20) Trading Days (whether or not consecutive) during the thirty (30) consecutive Trading Days ending on, and including, the last Trading Day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter.
- 43 -
(2)
Conversion upon Satisfaction of Note Trading Price Condition
. Before the Close of Business on the Business Day immediately before August 1, 2031, a Holder may convert its Notes during the five (5) consecutive Business Days immediately after any ten (10) consecutive Trading Day period (such ten (10) consecutive Trading Day period, the “
Measurement Period
”) if the Trading Price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, as determined following a request by a Holder in accordance with the procedures set forth below, for each Trading Day of the Measurement Period was less than ninety eight percent (98%) of the product of the Last Reported Sale Price per share of Common Stock on such Trading Day and the Conversion Rate on such Trading Day. The condition set forth in the preceding sentence is referred to in this Indenture as the “
Trading Price Condition
.”
The Trading Price will be determined by the Bid Solicitation Agent pursuant to this
Section 5.01(C)(i)(2)
and the definition of “Trading Price.” The Bid Solicitation Agent (if not the Company) will have no obligation to determine the Trading Price of the Notes unless the Company has requested such determination in writing, and the Company will have no obligation to make such request (or seek bids itself) unless a Holder (or Holders) of at least five million dollars ($5,000,000) in aggregate principal amount of Notes provides the Company with reasonable evidence that the Trading Price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes would be less than ninety eight percent (98%) of the product of the Last Reported Sale Price per share of Common Stock and the Conversion Rate. If a Holder provides such evidence, then the Company will (if acting as Bid Solicitation Agent), or will instruct the Bid Solicitation Agent to, determine the Trading Price of the Notes beginning on the next Trading Day and on each successive Trading Day until the Trading Price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes is greater than or equal to ninety eight percent (98%) of the product of the Last Reported Sale Price per share of Common Stock on such Trading Day and the Conversion Rate on such Trading Day. If the Trading Price Condition has been met as set forth above, then the Company will notify the Holders, the Trustee and the Conversion Agent of the same. The Company will select the institutions to provide bids to the Bid Solicitation Agent and will instruct such institutions to provide bids to the Bid Solicitation Agent in accordance with the definition of “Trading Price.” If, on any Trading Day after the Trading Price Condition has been met as set forth above, the Trading Price per $1,000 principal amount of Notes is greater than or equal to ninety eight percent (98%) of the product of the Last Reported Sale Price per share of Common Stock on such Trading Day and the Conversion Rate on such Trading Day, then the Company will notify the Holders, the Trustee and the Conversion Agent of the same.

(I)    distribute, to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock, any rights, options or warrants (other than rights issued pursuant to a stockholder rights plan, so long as such rights have not separated from the Common Stock and are not exercisable until the occurrence of a triggering event, except that such rights will be deemed to be distributed under this
clause (I)
upon their separation from the Common Stock or upon the occurrence of such triggering event) entitling them, for a period of not more than sixty (60) calendar days after the date such distribution is announced, to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share that is less than the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices per share of Common Stock for the ten (10) consecutive Trading Days ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately before the date such distribution is announced (determined in the manner set forth in the third paragraph of
Section 5.05(A)(ii)
); or
(II)    distribute, to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock, assets or securities of the Company or rights to purchase the Company’s securities, which distribution per share of Common Stock has a value, as reasonably determined by the Company in good faith, exceeding ten percent (10%) of the Last Reported Sale Price per share of Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately before the date such distribution is announced,
then, in either case, (x) the Company will send notice of such distribution, and of the related right to convert Notes, to Holders, the Trustee and the Conversion Agent at least thirty five (35) Scheduled Trading Days before the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution (or, if later in the case of any such separation of rights issued pursuant to a stockholder rights plan or the occurrence of any such triggering event under a stockholder rights plan, no later than the Business Day after the Company becomes aware that such separation or triggering event has occurred or will occur); and (y) once the Company has sent such notice, Holders may convert their Notes at any time until the earlier of the Close of Business on the Business Day immediately before such Ex-Dividend Date and the Company’s announcement that such distribution will not take place;
provided
,
however
, that the Notes will not become convertible pursuant to clause (y) above (but the Company will be required to send notice of such distribution pursuant to clause (x) above) on account of such distribution if each Holder participates, at the same time and on the same terms as holders of Common Stock, and solely by virtue of being a Holder, in such distribution without having to convert such Holder’s Notes and as if such Holder held a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the product of (i) the Conversion Rate in effect on the record date for such distribution; and (ii) the aggregate principal amount (expressed in thousands) of Notes held by such Holder on such date;
provided
,
further
, that if the Company is then otherwise permitted to settle conversions of Notes by Physical Settlement (and, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company has not elected another Settlement Method to apply, including pursuant to
Section 5.03(A)(i)(1)
), then the Company may instead elect to provide such notice at least ten (10) Scheduled Trading Days before such Ex-Dividend Date, in which case (x) the Company must settle all conversions of Notes with a Conversion Date occurring on or after the date the Company provides such notice and on or before the Business Day immediately before the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution (or any earlier announcement by the Company that such distribution will not take place) by Physical Settlement; and (y) such notice must state that all such conversions will be settled by Physical Settlement.

provided
,
however
, that if the Company does not provide the notice referred to in the immediately following sentence by the Business Day after such effective date, then the last day on which the Notes are convertible pursuant to this sentence will be extended by the number of Business Days from, and including, the Business Day after such effective date to, but excluding, the date the Company provides such notice. No later than the Business Day after such effective date, the Company will send written notice to the Holders, the Trustee and the Conversion Agent of such transaction or event, such effective date and the related right to convert Notes.

of this
Section 5.01(C)(i)

Section 5.01(C)(i)
and the Notes ceasing to be convertible pursuant to a particular sub-paragraph of this
Section 5.01(C)(i)
will not preclude the Notes from being convertible pursuant to any other sub-paragraph of this
Section 5.01(C)(i)
.
(ii)
Limitations and Closed Periods
. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Indenture or the Notes:
(1)    Notes may be surrendered for conversion during a period where the Notes are convertible pursuant to
Section 5.01(C)
only after the Open of Business and before the Close of Business on a Business Day;
(2)    in no event may any Note be converted after the Close of Business on the second (2nd) Scheduled Trading Day immediately before the Maturity Date;
(3)    if the Company calls any Note for Redemption pursuant to
Section 4.03
, then the Holder of such Note may not convert such Note after the Close of Business on the second (2nd) Scheduled Trading Day immediately before the applicable Redemption Date, except to the extent the Company fails to pay the Redemption Price for such Note in accordance with this Indenture; and
- 46 -
(4)    if a Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice is validly delivered pursuant to
Section 4.02(F)
or an Optional Repurchase Notice is validly delivered pursuant to
Section 4.04(E)
with respect to any Note, then, in either case, such Note may not be converted, except to the extent (a) such Note is not subject to such notice; (b) such notice is withdrawn in accordance with

clause (i)
above;
provided
,
however
, that the Holder surrendering such Note for conversion need not deliver such cash (w) if such Note is called (or deemed, pursuant to

provided
,
however
, that if any tax or duty is due because such Holder requested such shares to be registered in a name other than such Holder’s name, then such Holder will pay such tax or duty and, until having received a sum sufficient to pay such tax or duty, the Conversion Agent may refuse to deliver any such shares to be issued in a name other than that of such Holder.

(2)    subject to
clause (3)

- 49 -
(3)    if any Notes are called for Redemption, then (a) the Company will specify, in the related Redemption Notice sent pursuant to
Section 4.03(G)
, the Settlement Method that will apply to all conversions of Notes with a Conversion Date that occurs during the related Redemption Conversion Period; and (b) if such Redemption Date occurs on or after August 1, 2031, then such Settlement Method must be the same Settlement Method that, pursuant to

(3)
above);
(5)    if the Company does not timely elect a Settlement Method with respect to the conversion of a Note, then the Company will be deemed to have elected the Default Settlement Method (and, for the avoidance of doubt, the failure to timely make such election will not constitute a Default or Event of Default); and
(6)    if the Company timely elects Combination Settlement with respect to the conversion of a Note but does not timely notify the Holder of such Note of the applicable Specified Dollar Amount, then the Specified Dollar Amount for such conversion will be deemed to be $1,000 per $1,000 principal amount of Notes (and, for the avoidance of doubt, the failure to timely send such notification will not constitute a Default or Event of Default); and
(7)    the Settlement Method will be subject to
Section
4.03(E)
,
Section 5.01(C)(i)(3)(a)
,
Section 5.07(D)
and
Section 5.09(A).
(ii)
The Company’s Right to Irrevocably Fix the Settlement Method

provided
that the Settlement Method so elected pursuant to
clause (1)
above, or the Settlement Method(s) remaining after any elimination pursuant to
clause (2)
above, as applicable, must be a Settlement Method or Settlement Method(s), as applicable, that the Company is then permitted to elect (for the avoidance of doubt, including pursuant to, and subject to, the other provisions of this
Section 5.03(A)
). Such notice, if sent, must set forth the Settlement Method so elected, or the Settlement Method(s) so eliminated, as applicable, and expressly state that the election is irrevocable and applicable to all conversions of Notes with a Conversion Date that occurs on or after the date such notice is sent to Holders. Upon any such irrevocable election pursuant to
clause (1)
above, the Default Settlement Method will automatically be deemed to be set to the Settlement Method so elected; and upon any such irrevocable election pursuant to
clause (2)
above, the Company will, if needed, simultaneously change the Default Settlement Method to a Settlement Method that is consistent with such irrevocable election. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding sentences of this paragraph, no such change in the Default Settlement Method or irrevocable election will affect any Settlement Method theretofore elected (or deemed to be elected) with respect to any Note pursuant to this Indenture (including pursuant to this
Section 5.03(A)
). For the avoidance of doubt, such an irrevocable election, if made, will be effective without the need to amend this Indenture or the Notes, including pursuant to

- 51 -
(ii)
Cash in Lieu of Fractional Shares
. If Physical Settlement or Combination Settlement applies to the conversion of any Note and the number of shares of Common Stock deliverable pursuant to
Section 5.03(B)(i)
upon such conversion is not a whole number, then such number will be rounded down to the nearest whole number and the Company will deliver, in addition to the other consideration due upon such conversion, cash in lieu of the related fractional share in an amount equal to the product of (1) such fraction and (2) (x) the Daily VWAP on the applicable Conversion Date for such conversion (or, if such Conversion Date is not a VWAP Trading Day, the immediately preceding VWAP Trading Day), in the case of Physical Settlement; or (y) the Daily VWAP on the last VWAP Trading Day of the Observation Period for such conversion, in the case of Combination Settlement.
(iii)
Conversion of Multiple Notes by a Single Holder
. If a Holder converts more than one (1) Note on a single Conversion Date, then the Conversion Consideration due in respect of such conversion will (in the case of any Global Note, to the extent permitted by, and practicable under, the Depositary Procedures) be computed based on the total principal amount of Notes converted on such Conversion Date by such Holder.
(iv)
Notice of Calculation of Conversion Consideration
. If Cash Settlement or Combination Settlement applies to the conversion of any Note, then the Company will determine the Conversion Consideration due thereupon promptly following the last VWAP Trading Day of the applicable Observation Period and will promptly thereafter send notice to the Trustee and the Conversion Agent of the same and the calculation thereof in reasonable detail. Neither the Trustee, the Conversion Agent nor the Paying Agent will have any duty to make any such determination.

provided
,
however
, that if Physical Settlement applies to the conversion of any Note with a Conversion Date that is after the Regular Record Date immediately before the Maturity Date, then, solely for purposes of such conversion, (x) the Company will pay or deliver, as applicable, the Conversion Consideration due upon such conversion no later than the Maturity Date (or, if the Maturity Date is not a Business Day, the next Business Day); and (y) the Conversion Date will instead be deemed to be the second (2nd) Business Day immediately before the Maturity Date.
(D)
Deemed Payment of Principal and Interest; Settlement of Accrued Interest Notwithstanding Conversion
. If a Holder converts a Note, then the Company will not adjust the Conversion Rate to account for any accrued and unpaid interest on such Note, and, except as provided in
Section 5.02(D)
, the Company’s delivery of the Conversion Consideration due in respect of such conversion will be deemed to fully satisfy and discharge the Company’s obligation to pay the principal of, and accrued and unpaid interest, if any, on, such Note to, but excluding the Conversion Date. As a result, except as provided in
Section 5.02(D)
, any accrued and unpaid interest on a converted Note will be deemed to be paid in full rather than cancelled, extinguished or forfeited. In addition, subject to
Section 5.02(D)
, if the Conversion Consideration for a Note consists of both cash and shares of Common Stock, then accrued and unpaid interest that is deemed to be paid therewith will be deemed to be paid first out of such cash.
- 52 -
Section 5.04. Reserve and Status of Common Stock Issued upon Conversion.
(A)
Stock Reserve
. At all times when any Notes are outstanding, the Company will reserve, out of its authorized, unreserved and not outstanding shares of Common Stock, a number of shares of Common Stock sufficient to permit the conversion of all then-outstanding Notes, assuming (x) Physical Settlement will apply to such conversion; and (y) the Conversion Rate is increased by the maximum amount pursuant to which the Conversion Rate may be increased pursuant to
Section 5.07
. To the extent the Company delivers shares of Common Stock held in its treasury in settlement of the conversion of any Notes, each reference in this Indenture or the Notes to the issuance of shares of Common Stock in connection therewith will be deemed to include such delivery,
mutatis mutandis
.
(B)
Status of Conversion Shares; Listing
. Each Conversion Share, if any, delivered upon conversion of any Note will be a newly issued or treasury share (except that any Conversion Share delivered by a designated financial institution pursuant to
Section 5.08
need not be a newly issued or treasury share) and will be duly and validly issued, fully paid, non-assessable, free from preemptive rights and free of any lien or adverse claim (except to the extent of any lien or adverse claim created by the action or inaction of the Holder of such Note or the Person to whom such Conversion Share will be delivered). If the Common Stock is then listed on any securities exchange, or quoted on any inter-dealer quotation system, then the Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Conversion Share, when delivered upon conversion of any Note, to be admitted for listing on such exchange or quotation on such system.
Section 5.05. Adjustments to the Conversion Rate.
(A)
Events Requiring an Adjustment to the Conversion Rate
. The Conversion Rate will be adjusted from time to time as follows:
(i)
Stock Dividends, Splits and Combinations
. If the Company issues solely shares of Common Stock as a dividend or distribution on all or substantially all shares of the Common Stock, or if the Company effects a stock split or a stock combination of the Common Stock (in each case excluding an issuance solely pursuant to a Common Stock Change Event, as to which
Section 5.09
will apply), then the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:
where:
CR
0
=    the Conversion Rate in effect immediately before the Open of Business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution, or immediately before the Open of Business on the effective date of such stock split or stock combination, as applicable;
CR
1
=    the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the Open of Business on such Ex-Dividend Date or effective date, as applicable;
OS
0
=    the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately before the Open of Business on such Ex-Dividend Date or effective date, as applicable, without giving effect to such dividend, distribution, stock split or stock combination; and
OS
1
=    the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such dividend, distribution, stock split or stock combination.
- 53 -
If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this
Section 5.05(A)(i)
is declared, but not so paid, then the Conversion Rate will be readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors determines not to pay such dividend or distribution, to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had such dividend or distribution not been declared.
(ii)
Rights, Options and Warrants
. If the Company distributes, to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock, rights, options or warrants (other than rights issued or otherwise distributed pursuant to a stockholder rights plan, as to which
Sections 5.05(A)(iii)(1)
and
5.05(F)
will apply) entitling such holders, for a period of not more than sixty (60) calendar days after the date such distribution is announced, to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share that is less than the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices per share of Common Stock for the ten (10) consecutive Trading Days ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately before the date such distribution is announced, then the Conversion Rate will be increased based on the following formula:
where:
CR
0
=    the Conversion Rate in effect immediately before the Open of Business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution;
CR
1
=    the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the Open of Business on such Ex-Dividend Date;
OS
=    the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately before the Open of Business on such Ex-Dividend Date;
X
=    the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to such rights, options or warrants; and
Y
=    a number of shares of Common Stock obtained by dividing (x) the aggregate price payable to exercise such rights, options or warrants by (y) the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices per share of Common Stock for the ten (10) consecutive Trading Days ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately before the date such distribution is announced.
- 54 -
To the extent that shares of Common Stock are not delivered after the expiration of such rights, options or warrants (including as a result of such rights, options or warrants not being exercised), the Conversion Rate will be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the increase to the Conversion Rate for such distribution been made on the basis of delivery of only the number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered upon exercise of such rights, options or warrants. To the extent such rights, options or warrants are not so distributed, the Conversion Rate will be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the Ex-Dividend Date for the distribution of such rights, options or warrants not occurred.
For purposes of this
Section 5.05(A)(ii)
and
Section 5.01(C)(i)(3)(a)(I)
, in determining whether any rights, options or warrants entitle holders of Common Stock to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at a price per share that is less than the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices per share of Common Stock for the ten (10) consecutive Trading Days ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately before the date the distribution of such rights, options or warrants is announced, and in determining the aggregate price payable to exercise such rights, options or warrants, there will be taken into account any consideration the Company receives for such rights, options or warrants and any amount payable on exercise thereof, with the value of such consideration, if not cash, to be determined by the Company in good faith.
(iii)
Spin-Offs and Other Distributed Property
.
(1)
Distributions Other than Spin-Offs
. If the Company distributes shares of its Capital Stock, evidences of its indebtedness or other assets or property of the Company, or rights, options or warrants to acquire Capital Stock of the Company or other securities, to all or substantially all holders of the Common Stock, excluding:
(u)    dividends, distributions, rights, options or warrants for which an adjustment to the Conversion Rate is required (or would be required without regard to
Section 5.05(C)
) pursuant to Section
5.05(A)(i)
or
5.05(A)(ii)
;
(v)    dividends or distributions paid exclusively in cash for which an adjustment to the Conversion Rate is required (or would be required without regard to
Section 5.05(C)
) pursuant to
Section 5.05(A)(iv)
;
(w)    rights issued or otherwise distributed pursuant to a stockholder rights plan, except to the extent provided in
Section 5.05(F)
;
(x)    Spin-Offs for which an adjustment to the Conversion Rate is required (or would be required without regard to
Section 5.05(C)
) pursuant to
Section 5.05(A)(iii)(2)
;
- 55 -
(y)    a distribution solely pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer for shares of Common Stock, as to which
Section 5.05(A)(v)
will apply; and
(z)    a distribution solely pursuant to a Common Stock Change Event, as to which
Section 5.09
will apply,
then the Conversion Rate will be increased based on the following formula:
where:
CR
0
=    the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Open of Business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution;
CR
1
=    the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the Open of Business on such Ex-Dividend Date;
SP
=    the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of Common Stock over the ten (10) consecutive Trading Day period ending on, and including, the Trading Day immediately prior to such Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution; and
FMV
=    the fair market value (as determined by the Company in good faith), as of such Ex-Dividend Date, of the shares of Capital Stock, evidences of indebtedness, assets, property, rights, options or warrants distributed per share of Common Stock pursuant to such distribution;
provided
,
however
, that if
FMV
is equal to or greater than
SP
, then, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment to the Conversion Rate, each Holder will receive, for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes held by such Holder on the record date for such distribution, at the same time and on the same terms as holders of Common Stock, without having to convert its Notes, the amount and kind of shares of Capital Stock, evidences of indebtedness, assets, property, rights, options or warrants that such Holder would have received if such Holder had owned, on such record date, a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate in effect on such record date.
To the extent such distribution is not so paid or made, the Conversion Rate will be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the adjustment been made on the basis of only the distribution, if any, actually made or paid.
- 56 -
(2)
Spin-Offs
. If the Company distributes or dividends shares of Capital Stock of any class or series, or similar equity interests, of or relating to an Affiliate, a Subsidiary or other business unit of the Company to all or substantially all holders of the Common Stock (other than solely pursuant to (x) a Common Stock Change Event, as to which
Section 5.09
will apply; or (y) a tender offer or exchange offer for shares of Common Stock, as to which
Section 5.05(A)(v)
will apply), and such Capital Stock or equity interests are listed or quoted (or will be listed or quoted upon the consummation of the transaction) on a U.S. national securities exchange (a “
Spin-Off
”), then the Conversion Rate will be increased based on the following formula:
where:
CR
0
=    the Conversion Rate in effect immediately before the Close of Business on the last Trading Day of the Spin-Off Valuation Period for such Spin-Off;
CR
1
=    the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the Close of Business on the last Trading Day of the Spin-Off Valuation Period;
FMV
=    the product of (x) the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices per share or unit of the Capital Stock or equity interests distributed in such Spin-Off over the ten (10) consecutive Trading Day period (the “
Spin-Off Valuation Period
”) beginning on, and including, the Ex-Dividend Date for such Spin-Off (such average to be determined as if references to Common Stock in the definitions of Last Reported Sale Price, Trading Day and Market Disruption Event were instead references to such Capital Stock or equity interests); and (y) the number of shares or units of such Capital Stock or equity interests distributed per share of Common Stock in such Spin-Off; and
SP
=    the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices per share of Common Stock for each Trading Day in the Spin-Off Valuation Period.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 5.05(A)(iii)(2)
, (i) if any VWAP Trading Day of the Observation Period for a Note whose conversion will be settled pursuant to Cash Settlement or Combination Settlement occurs during the Spin-Off Valuation Period for such Spin-Off, then, solely for purposes of determining the Conversion Rate for such VWAP Trading Day for such conversion, such Spin-Off Valuation Period will be deemed to consist of the Trading Days occurring in the period from, and including, the Ex-Dividend Date for such Spin-Off to, and including, such VWAP Trading Day; and (ii) if the Conversion Date for a Note whose conversion will be settled pursuant to Physical Settlement occurs during the Spin-Off Valuation Period for such Spin-Off, then, solely for purposes of determining the Conversion Consideration for such conversion, such Spin-Off Valuation Period will be deemed to consist of the Trading Days occurring in the period from, and including, the Ex-Dividend Date for such Spin-Off to, and including, such Conversion Date.
- 57 -
To the extent any dividend or distribution of the type set forth in this
Section 5.05(A)(iii)(2)
is declared but not made or paid, the Conversion Rate will be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the adjustment been made on the basis of only the dividend or distribution, if any, actually made or paid.
(iv)
Cash Dividends or Distributions
. If any cash dividend or distribution is made to all or substantially all holders of Common Stock, then the Conversion Rate will be increased based on the following formula:
where:
CR
0
=    the Conversion Rate in effect immediately before the Open of Business on the Ex-Dividend Date for such dividend or distribution;
CR
1
=    the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the Open of Business on such Ex-Dividend Date;
SP
=    the Last Reported Sale Price per share of Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately before such Ex-Dividend Date; and
D
=    the cash amount distributed per share of Common Stock in such dividend or distribution;
provided
,
however
, that if
D
is equal to or greater than
SP
, then, in lieu of the foregoing adjustment to the Conversion Rate, each Holder will receive, for each $1,000 principal amount of Notes held by such Holder on the record date for such dividend or distribution, at the same time and on the same terms as holders of Common Stock, without having to convert its Notes, the amount of cash that such Holder would have received if such Holder had owned, on such record date, a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate in effect on such record date.
To the extent such dividend or distribution is declared but not made or paid, the Conversion Rate will be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the adjustment been made on the basis of only the dividend or distribution, if any, actually made or paid.
- 58 -
(v)
Tender Offers or Exchange Offers
. If the Company or any of its Subsidiaries makes a payment in respect of a tender offer or exchange offer for shares of Common Stock (other than solely pursuant to an odd-lot tender offer pursuant to Rule 13e-4(h)(5) under the Exchange Act (or any successor rule)), and the value (determined as of the Expiration Time by the Company in good faith) of the cash and other consideration paid per share of Common Stock in such tender or exchange offer exceeds the Last Reported Sale Price per share of Common Stock on the Trading Day immediately after the last date (the “
Expiration Date
”) on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or exchange offer (as it may be amended), then the Conversion Rate will be increased based on the following formula:
where:
CR
0
=    the Conversion Rate in effect immediately before the Close of Business on the last Trading Day of the Tender/Exchange Offer Valuation Period for such tender or exchange offer;
CR
1
=    the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the Close of Business on the last Trading Day of the Tender/Exchange Offer Valuation Period;
AC
=    the aggregate value, as of the time such tender or exchange offer expires (the “
Expiration Time
”), of all cash and other consideration paid for shares of Common Stock purchased or exchanged in such tender or exchange offer (such aggregate value to be determined, other than with respect to cash, by the Company in good faith);
OS
0
=    the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately before the Expiration Time (including all shares of Common Stock accepted for purchase or exchange in such tender or exchange offer);
OS
1
=    the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after the Expiration Time (excluding all shares of Common Stock accepted for purchase or exchange in such tender or exchange offer); and
SP
=    the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices per share of Common Stock over the ten (10) consecutive Trading Day period (the “
Tender/Exchange Offer Valuation Period
”) beginning on, and including, the Trading Day immediately after the Expiration Date;
provided
,
however
, that the Conversion Rate will in no event be adjusted down pursuant to this
Section 5.05(A)(v)
, except to the extent provided in the immediately following paragraph. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 5.05(A)(v)
, (i) if any VWAP Trading Day of the Observation Period for a Note whose conversion will be settled pursuant to Cash Settlement or Combination Settlement occurs during the Tender/Exchange Offer Valuation Period for such tender or exchange offer, then, solely for purposes of determining the Conversion Rate for such VWAP Trading Day for such conversion, such Tender/Exchange Offer Valuation Period will be deemed to consist of the Trading Days occurring in the period from, and including, the Trading Day immediately after the Expiration Date for such tender or exchange offer to, and including, such VWAP Trading Day; and (ii) if the Conversion Date for a Note whose conversion will be settled pursuant to Physical Settlement occurs during the Tender/Exchange Offer Valuation Period for such tender or exchange offer, then, solely for purposes of determining the Conversion Consideration for such conversion, such Tender/Exchange Offer Valuation Period will be deemed to
- 59 -
consist of the Trading Days occurring in the period from, and including, the Trading Day immediately after the Expiration Date to, and including, such Conversion Date.
To the extent such tender or exchange offer is announced but not consummated (including as a result of being precluded from consummating such tender or exchange offer under applicable law), or any purchases or exchanges of shares of Common Stock in such tender or exchange offer are rescinded, the Conversion Rate will be readjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect had the adjustment been made on the basis of only the purchases or exchanges of shares of Common Stock, if any, actually made, and not rescinded, in such tender or exchange offer.
(B)
No Adjustments in Certain Cases
.
(i)
Where Holders Participate in the Transaction or Event Without Conversion
. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
Section 5.05(A)
, the Company will not be obligated to adjust the Conversion Rate on account of a transaction or other event otherwise requiring an adjustment pursuant to
Section 5.05(A)
(other than a stock split or combination of the type set forth in
Section 5.05(A)(i)
or a tender or exchange offer of the type set forth in
Section 5.05(A)(v)
) if each Holder participates, at the same time and on the same terms as holders of Common Stock, and solely by virtue of being a Holder of Notes, in such transaction or event without having to convert such Holder’s Notes and as if such Holder held a number of shares of Common Stock equal to the product of (i) the Conversion Rate in effect on the related record date; and (ii) the aggregate principal amount (expressed in thousands) of Notes held by such Holder on such date.
(ii)
Certain Events
. The Company will not be required to adjust the Conversion Rate except as provided in
Section 5.05
or
Section 5.07
. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company will not be obligated to adjust the Conversion Rate on account of:
(1)    except as otherwise provided in
Section 5.05
, the sale of shares of Common Stock for a purchase price that is less than the market price per share of Common Stock or less than the Conversion Price;
(2)    the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any present or future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or interest payable on the Company’s securities and the investment of additional optional amounts in shares of Common Stock under any such plan;
- 60 -
(3)    the issuance of any shares of Common Stock or options or rights to purchase shares of Common Stock pursuant to any present or future employee, director or consultant benefit plan or program of, or assumed by, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;
(4)    the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any option, warrant, right or convertible or exchangeable security of the Company outstanding as of the Issue Date;
(5)    solely a change in the par value of the Common Stock; or
(6)    accrued and unpaid interest on the Notes.
(C)
Adjustment Deferral
. If an adjustment to the Conversion Rate otherwise required by this
Article 5
would result in a change of less than one percent (1%) to the Conversion Rate, then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Article 5
, the Company may, at its election, defer such adjustment, except that all such deferred adjustments must be given effect immediately upon the earliest of the following: (i) when all such deferred adjustments would result in an aggregate change of at least one percent (1%) to the Conversion Rate; (ii) the Conversion Date of, or any VWAP Trading Day of an Observation Period for, any Note; (iii) the effective date of a Fundamental Change or a Make-Whole Fundamental Change Effective Date; (iv) any Redemption Notice Date; and (v) August 1, 2031.
(D)
Adjustments Not Yet Effective
. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Indenture or the Notes, if:
(i)    a Note is to be converted pursuant to Physical Settlement or Combination Settlement;
(ii)    the record date, effective date or Expiration Time for any event that requires an adjustment to the Conversion Rate pursuant to
Section 5.05(A)
has occurred on or before the Conversion Date for such conversion (in the case of Physical Settlement) or on or before any VWAP Trading Day in the Observation Period for such conversion (in the case of Combination Settlement), but an adjustment to the Conversion Rate for such event has not yet become effective as of such Conversion Date or VWAP Trading Day, as applicable;
(iii)    the Conversion Consideration due upon such conversion (in the case of Physical Settlement) includes any whole shares of Common Stock or due in respect of such VWAP Trading Day (in the case of Combination Settlement) includes any whole or fractional shares of Common Stock; and
(iv)    such shares are not entitled to participate in such event (because they were not held on the related record date or otherwise),
then, solely for purposes of such conversion, the Company will, without duplication, give effect to such adjustment on such Conversion Date (in the case of Physical Settlement) or such VWAP Trading Day (in the case of Combination Settlement). In such case, if the date on which the Company is otherwise required to deliver the consideration due upon such conversion is before the first date on which the amount of such adjustment can be determined, then the Company will delay the settlement of such conversion until the second (2nd) Business Day after such determination date.
- 61 -
(E)
Conversion Rate Adjustments where Converting Holders Participate in the Relevant Transaction or Event
. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Indenture or the Notes, if:
(i)    a Conversion Rate adjustment for any dividend or distribution becomes effective on any Ex-Dividend Date pursuant to
Section 5.05(A)
;
(ii)    a Note is to be converted pursuant to Physical Settlement or Combination Settlement;
(iii)    the Conversion Date for such conversion (in the case of Physical Settlement) or any VWAP Trading Day in the Observation Period for such conversion (in the case of Combination Settlement) occurs on or after such Ex-Dividend Date and on or before the related record date;
(iv)    the Conversion Consideration due upon such conversion (in the case of Physical Settlement) includes any whole shares of Common Stock or due in respect of such VWAP Trading Day (in the case of Combination Settlement) includes any whole or fractional shares of Common Stock, in each case based on a Conversion Rate that is adjusted for such dividend or distribution; and
(v)    such shares would be entitled to participate in such dividend or distribution (including pursuant to
Section 5.02(C)
),
then (x) in the case of Physical Settlement, such Conversion Rate adjustment will not be given effect for such conversion and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion based on such unadjusted Conversion Rate will not be entitled to participate in such dividend or distribution, but there will be added, to the consideration otherwise due upon such conversion, the same kind and amount of consideration that would have been delivered in such dividend or distribution with respect to such shares of Common Stock had such shares been entitled to participate in such dividend or distribution; and (y) in the case of Combination Settlement, the Conversion Rate adjustment relating to such Ex-Dividend Date will be made for such conversion in respect of such VWAP Trading Day, but the shares of Common Stock issuable with respect to such VWAP Trading Day based on such adjusted Conversion Rate will not be entitled to participate in such dividend or distribution.
(F)
Stockholder Rights Plans
. If any shares of Common Stock are to be issued upon conversion of any Note and, at the time of such conversion, the Company has in effect any stockholder rights plan, then the Holder of such Note will be entitled to receive, in addition to, and concurrently with the delivery of, the Conversion Consideration otherwise payable under this Indenture upon such conversion, the rights set forth in such stockholder rights plan, unless such rights have separated from the Common Stock at such time, in which case, and only in such case, the Conversion Rate will be adjusted pursuant to
Section 5.05(A)(iii)(1)
on account of such separation as if, at the time of such separation, the Company had made a distribution of the type referred to in such Section to all holders of the Common Stock, subject to readjustment in accordance with such Section if such rights expire, terminate or are redeemed.
- 62 -
(G)
Limitation on Effecting Transactions Resulting in Certain Adjustments
. The Company will not engage in or be a party to any transaction or event that would require the Conversion Rate to be adjusted pursuant to
Section 5.05(A)
or
Section 5.07
to an amount that would result in the Conversion Price per share of Common Stock being less than the par value per share of Common Stock.
(H)
Equitable Adjustments to Prices
. Whenever any provision of this Indenture requires the Company to calculate the Last Reported Sale Prices, the Daily VWAPs, the Daily Conversion Values, the Daily Cash Amounts or the Daily Share Amounts over a period of multiple days (including over an Observation Period and the period, if any, for determining the Stock Price for purposes of a Make-Whole Fundamental Change), the Company will, acting in good faith and in a commercially reasonable manner, make appropriate adjustments, if any, to each to account for any adjustment to the Conversion Rate that becomes effective, or any event requiring an adjustment to the Conversion Rate where the Ex-Dividend Date, effective date, or Expiration Date of the event occurs, at any time during such period.
(I)
Calculation of Number of Outstanding Shares of Common Stock
. For purposes of
Section 5.05(A)
, the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any time will (i) include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock; and (ii) exclude shares of Common Stock held in the Company’s treasury (unless the Company pays any dividend or makes any distribution on shares of Common Stock held in its treasury).
(J)
Calculations
. All calculations with respect to the Conversion Rate and adjustments thereto will be made to the nearest 1/10,000th of a share of Common Stock (with 5/100,000ths rounded upward).
(K)
Notice of Conversion Rate Adjustments
. Upon the effectiveness of any adjustment to the Conversion Rate pursuant to
Section 5.05(A)
, the Company will promptly send notice to the Holders, the Trustee and the Conversion Agent containing (i) a brief description of the transaction or other event on account of which such adjustment was made; (ii) the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after such adjustment; and (iii) the effective time of such adjustment.
Section 5.06. Voluntary Adjustments.
(A)
Generally
. To the extent permitted by law and applicable stock exchange rules, the Company, from time to time, may (but is not required to) increase the Conversion Rate by any amount if (i) the Board of Directors determines that such increase is either (x) in the best interest of the Company; or (y) advisable to avoid or diminish any income tax imposed on holders of Common Stock or rights to purchase Common Stock as a result of any dividend or distribution of shares (or rights to acquire shares) of Common Stock or any similar event; and (ii) such increase is irrevocably in effect for a period of at least twenty (20) Business Days.
(B)
Notice of Voluntary Increases
. If the Board of Directors determines to increase the Conversion Rate pursuant to
Section 5.06(A)
, then, no later than the first Business Day of the related twenty (20) Business Day period referred to in
Section 5.06(A)
, the Company will send notice to each Holder, the Trustee and the Conversion Agent of such increase, the amount thereof and the period during which such increase will be in effect.
- 63 -
Section 5.07. Adjustments to the Conversion Rate in Connection with a Make-Whole Fundamental Change.
(A)
Generally
. If a Make-Whole Fundamental Change occurs and the Conversion Date for the conversion of a Note occurs during the related Make-Whole Fundamental Change Conversion Period, then, subject to this
Section 5.07
, the Conversion Rate applicable to such conversion will be increased by a number of shares (the “

(i)    if such Stock Price is between two Stock Prices in the table above or the Make-Whole Fundamental Change Effective Date is between two dates in the table above, then the number of Additional Shares will be determined by straight-line interpolation between the numbers of Additional Shares set forth for the higher and lower Stock Prices in the table above or the earlier and later dates in the table above, based on a 365- or 366-day year, as applicable; and
(ii)    if the Stock Price is greater than $175.00 (subject to adjustment in the same manner as the Stock Prices set forth in the column headings of the table above are adjusted pursuant to
Section 5.07(B)
), or less than $16.99 (subject to adjustment in the same manner), per share, then no Additional Shares will be added to the Conversion Rate.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Indenture or the Notes, in no event will the Conversion Rate be increased to an amount that exceeds 58.8581 shares of Common Stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes, which amount is subject to adjustment in the same manner as, and at the same time and for the same events for which, the Conversion Rate is required to be adjusted pursuant to
Section 5.05(A)
.
For the avoidance of doubt, but subject to
Section 4.03(J)
, (x) the sending of a Redemption Notice will constitute a Make-Whole Fundamental Change only with respect to the Notes called for Redemption pursuant to such Redemption Notice, and not with respect to any other Notes; and (y) the Conversion Rate applicable to the Notes not so called for Redemption will not be subject to increase pursuant to this
Section 5.07

Section 5.09
, conversions of Notes will thereafter be settled no later than the second (2nd) Business Day after the relevant Conversion Date.
Section 5.08. Exchange in Lieu of Conversion.

Article 5

To make such election, the Company must send written notice of such election to the Holder of such Note, the Trustee and the Conversion Agent before the Close of Business on the Business Day immediately following the Conversion Date for such Note. If the Company has made such election, then:
(A)    no later than the Business Day immediately following such Conversion Date, the Company must deliver (or cause the Conversion Agent to deliver) such Note, together with delivery instructions for the Conversion Consideration due upon such conversion (including wire instructions, if applicable), to a financial institution designated by the Company that has agreed to pay and/or deliver such Conversion Consideration (or such other amount agreed to by the Holder and the financial institution) in the manner and at the time the Company would have had to pay and/or deliver the same pursuant to this
Article 5
;
(B)    if such Note is a Global Note, then (i) such designated institution will send written confirmation to the Conversion Agent promptly after wiring the cash Conversion Consideration, if any, and delivering any other Conversion Consideration (or such other consideration agreed to by the Holder and the financial institution), due upon such conversion to the Holder of such Note; and (ii) the Conversion Agent will as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter contact such Holder’s custodian with the Depositary to confirm receipt of the same; and
(C)    such Note will not cease to be outstanding by reason of such exchange in lieu of conversion;
provided
,
however
, that if such financial institution does not accept such Note or fails to timely deliver the Conversion Consideration (or such other amount agreed to by the Holder and the financial institution) as set forth in
Section 5.08(A)
, then the Company will be responsible for delivering the Conversion Consideration in the manner and at the time provided in this
Article 5
as if the Company had not elected to make an exchange in lieu of conversion. The Conversion Agent will be entitled to conclusively rely upon the Company’s instruction in connection with effecting such exchange election and will have no liability in respect of such exchange election.

Section 5.09. Effect of Common Stock Change Event.
(A)
Generally
. If there occurs any:
(i)    recapitalization, reclassification or change of the Common Stock (other than (x) changes solely resulting from a subdivision or combination of the Common Stock, (y) a change only in par value or from par value to no par value or no par value to par value or (z) stock splits and stock combinations that do not involve the issuance of any other series or class of securities);
(ii)    consolidation, merger, combination or binding or statutory share exchange involving the Company;
(iii)    sale, lease or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Person; or
(iv)    other similar event,
and, as a result of which, the Common Stock is converted into, or is exchanged for, or represents solely the right to receive, other securities, cash or other property, or any combination of the foregoing (such an event, a “
Common Stock Change Event
,” and such other securities, cash or property, the “
Reference Property
,” and the amount and kind of Reference Property that a holder of one (1) share of Common Stock would be entitled to receive on account of such Common Stock Change Event (without giving effect to any arrangement not to issue or deliver a fractional portion of any security or other property), a “
Reference Property Unit
”), then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Indenture or the Notes,
(1)    from and after the effective time of such Common Stock Change Event, (I) the Conversion Consideration due upon conversion of any Note, and the conditions to any such conversion, will be determined in the same manner as if each reference to any number of shares of Common Stock in this
Article 5
(or in any related definitions) were instead a reference to the same number of Reference Property Units; (II) for purposes of
Section 4.03
, each reference to any number of shares of Common Stock in such Section (or in any related definitions) will instead be deemed to be a reference to the same number of Reference Property Units; and (III) for purposes of the definitions of “Fundamental Change” and “Make-Whole Fundamental Change,” references to “Common Stock” and the Company’s “common equity” will be deemed to mean the common equity, if any, forming part of such Reference Property;
- 66 -
(2)    if such Reference Property Unit consists entirely of cash, then (I) each conversion of any Note with a Conversion Date that occurs on or after the effective date of such Common Stock Change Event will be settled entirely in cash in an amount, per $1,000 principal amount of such Note being converted, equal to the product of (x) the Conversion Rate in effect on such Conversion Date (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any increase to such Conversion Rate pursuant to
Section 5.07
, if applicable); and (y) the amount of cash constituting such Reference Property Unit; and (II) the Company will settle each such conversion no later than the second (2nd) Business Day after the relevant Conversion Date; and
(3)    for these purposes, (I) the Daily VWAP of any Reference Property Unit or portion thereof that consists of a class of common equity securities will be determined by reference to the definition of “Daily VWAP,” substituting, if applicable, the Bloomberg page for such class of securities in such definition; and (II) the Daily VWAP of any Reference Property Unit or portion thereof that does not consist of a class of common equity securities, and the Last Reported Sale Price of any Reference Property Unit or portion thereof that does not consist of a class of securities, will be the fair value of such Reference Property Unit or portion thereof, as applicable, determined in good faith by the Company (or, in the case of cash denominated in U.S. dollars, the face amount thereof).
If the Reference Property consists of more than a single type of consideration to be determined based in part upon any form of stockholder election, then the composition of the Reference Property Unit will be deemed to be the weighted average of the types and amounts of consideration actually received, per share of Common Stock, by the holders of Common Stock. The Company will notify Holders, the Trustee and the Conversion Agent (if other than the Trustee) in writing of such weighted average as soon as practicable after such determination is made.
At or before the effective time of such Common Stock Change Event, the Company and the resulting, surviving or transferee Person (if not the Company) of such Common Stock Change Event (the “
Successor Person
”) will execute and deliver to the Trustee a supplemental indenture pursuant to
Section 8.01(F)
, which supplemental indenture will (x) provide for subsequent conversions of Notes in the manner set forth in this
Section 5.09
; (y) provide for subsequent adjustments to the Conversion Rate pursuant to
Section 5.05(A)
in a manner consistent with this
Section 5.09
; and (z) contain such other provisions, if any, that the Company reasonably determines are appropriate to preserve the economic interests of the Holders and to give effect to the provisions of this
Section 5.09(A)
. If the Reference Property includes shares of stock or other securities or assets (other than cash) of a Person other than the Successor Person, then such other Person will also execute such supplemental indenture and such supplemental indenture will contain such additional provisions, if any, that the Company reasonably determines are appropriate to preserve the economic interests of the Holders.
(B)
Notice of Common Stock Change Events
. The Company will provide notice of each Common Stock Change Event to Holders, the Trustee and the Conversion Agent no later than the Business Day after the effective date of such Common Stock Change Event.
(C)
Compliance Covenant
. The Company will not become a party to any Common Stock Change Event unless its terms are consistent with this
Section 5.09
.

Business Combination Event
”), unless:
(i)    the resulting, surviving or transferee Person either (x) is the Company or (y) if not the Company, is a corporation (or, if such Business Combination Event is an Exempted Fundamental Change, is a corporation, limited liability company, limited partnership or other similar entity) (the “
Successor Entity

Section 8.01(E)
) all of the Company’s obligations under this Indenture and the Notes; and

Section 6.01(A)
; and (ii) all conditions precedent to such Business Combination Event provided in this Indenture have been satisfied.
Section 6.02. Successor Entity Substituted.
At the effective time of any Business Combination Event that complies with
Section 6.01
, the Successor Entity (if not the Company) will succeed to, and may exercise every right and power of, the Company under this Indenture and the Notes with the same effect as if such Successor Entity had been named as the Company in this Indenture and the Notes, and, except in the case of a lease, the predecessor Company will be discharged from its obligations under this Indenture and the Notes.

with respect to the Company and not solely with respect to a Significant Subsidiary of the Company) occurs and is continuing, then the Trustee, by notice to the Company, or Holders of at least twenty five percent (25%) of the aggregate principal amount of Notes then outstanding, by notice to the Company and the Trustee, may declare the principal amount of, and all accrued and unpaid interest on, all of the Notes then outstanding to become due and payable immediately.
(C)

. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Indenture or the Notes, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding, by notice to the Company and the Trustee, may, on behalf of all Holders, rescind any acceleration of the Notes and its consequences if (i) such rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction; and (ii) all existing Events of Default (except the non-payment of principal of, or interest on, the Notes that has become due solely because of such acceleration) have been cured or waived.

Section 7.03. Sole Remedy for a Failure to Report.
(A)
Generally
. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Indenture or the Notes, the Company may elect that the sole remedy for any Event of Default (a “
Reporting Event of Default
”) pursuant to
Section 7.01(A)(vi)
arising from the Company’s failure to comply with
Section 3.02
will, for each of the first three hundred sixty-five (365) calendar days on which a Reporting Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, consist exclusively of the accrual of Special Interest on the Notes. If the Company has made such an election, then (i) the Notes will be subject to acceleration pursuant to
Section 7.02
on account of the relevant Reporting Event of Default from, and including, the three hundred sixty-sixth (366th) calendar day on which a Reporting Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or if the Company fails to pay any accrued and unpaid Special Interest when due; and (ii) Special Interest will cease to accrue on any Notes from, and including, such three hundred sixty-sixth (366th) calendar day (it being understood that interest on any defaulted Special Interest will nonetheless accrue pursuant to
Section 2.05(B)
).
- 71 -
(B)
Amount and Payment of Special Interest
. Any Special Interest that accrues on a Note pursuant to
Section 7.03(A)
will be payable on the same dates and in the same manner as the Stated Interest on such Note and will accrue at a rate per annum equal to one quarter of one percent (0.25%) of the principal amount thereof for the first one hundred eighty (180) days on which Special Interest accrues and, thereafter, at a rate per annum equal to one half of one percent (0.50%) of the principal amount thereof;
provided
,
however
, that in no event will Special Interest, together with any Additional Interest, accrue on any day on a Note at a combined rate per annum that exceeds one percent (1.00%). For the avoidance of doubt, any Special Interest that accrues on a Note will be in addition to the Stated Interest that accrues on such Note and, subject to the proviso of the immediately preceding sentence, in addition to any Additional Interest that accrues on such Note. If a Reporting Event of Default giving rise to the Company’s obligation to pay Special Interest pursuant to
Section 7.03(A)
initially occurs on or after the Close of Business on a Regular Record Date and prior to the Open of Business on the corresponding Interest Payment Date, the Special Interest that accrues during such period will be due on the Interest Payment Date next succeeding such corresponding Interest Payment Date, and no interest shall accrue in respect of such delay.
(C)
Notice of Election
. To make the election set forth in
Section 7.03(A)
, the Company must send to the Holders, the Trustee and the Paying Agent, before the date on which each Reporting Event of Default first occurs, a written notice that (i) briefly describes the report(s) that the Company failed to file with the SEC; (ii) states that the Company is electing that the sole remedy for such Reporting Event of Default consist of the accrual of Special Interest; and (iii) briefly describes the periods during which and rate at which Special Interest will accrue and the circumstances under which the Notes will be subject to acceleration on account of such Reporting Event of Default.
For the avoidance of doubt, if (x) the Company timely elects to pay Special Interest pursuant to
Section 7.03(A)
as the sole remedy during the first three hundred sixty-five (365) calendar days after the occurrence of a Reporting Event of Default in accordance with the immediately preceding paragraph, (y) the Company pays such Special Interest in accordance with
Section 7.03
and this Indenture and (z) the Company files the delinquent reports that were required to be filed and that gave rise to the relevant Reporting Event of Default (in each case in clause (z) pursuant to the provisions set forth in
Section 3.02
) prior to the three hundred sixty-sixth (366th) calendar day after the occurrence of such Reporting Event of Default (or prior to the delivery of any related notice of acceleration on or after such three hundred sixty-sixth (366th) calendar day), then the Event of Default related to such Reporting Event of Default shall be deemed cured and the Notes shall not be subject to acceleration as a result of the initial failure to comply with the Company’s obligations as set forth in
Section 3.02
.
(D)
Notice to Trustee and Paying Agent; Trustee’s Disclaimer
. If Special Interest accrues on any Note, then, no later than five (5) Business Days before each date on which such Special Interest is to be paid, the Company will deliver an Officer’s Certificate to the Trustee and the Paying Agent stating (i) that the Company is obligated to pay Special Interest on such Note on such date of payment; and (ii) the amount of such Special Interest that is payable on such date of payment. The Trustee will have no duty to determine whether any Special Interest is payable or the amount thereof.
(E)
No Effect on Other Events of Default
. No election pursuant to this
Section 7.03
with respect to a Reporting Event of Default will affect the rights of any Holder with respect to any other Event of Default, including with respect to any other Reporting Event of Default.
- 72 -
Section 7.04. Other Remedies.
(A)
Trustee May Pursue All Remedies
. If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, then the Trustee may pursue any available remedy to collect the payment of any amounts due with respect to the Notes or to enforce the performance of any provision of this Indenture or the Notes.
(B)
Procedural Matters
. The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess any of the Notes or does not produce any of them in such proceeding. A delay or omission by the Trustee or any Holder in exercising any right or remedy following an Event of Default will not impair the right or remedy or constitute a waiver of, or acquiescence in, such Event of Default. All remedies will be cumulative to the extent permitted by law.
Section 7.05. Waiver of Past Defaults.
An Event of Default pursuant to
clause (i)
,
(ii)
,
(iv)
or
(vi)
of
Section 7.01(A)
(that, in the case of
clause (vi)
only, results from a Default under any covenant that cannot be amended without the consent of each affected Holder), and a Default that could lead to such an Event of Default, can be waived only with the consent of each affected Holder. Each other Default or Event of Default may be waived, on behalf of all Holders, by the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding. If an Event of Default is so waived, then it will cease to exist. If a Default is so waived, then it will be deemed to be cured and any Event of Default arising therefrom will be deemed not to occur. However, no such waiver will extend to any subsequent or other Default or Event of Default or impair any right arising therefrom.
Section 7.06. Control by Majority.
Subject to the last sentence of this paragraph, Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for exercising any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on it. However, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts with law, this Indenture or the Notes, or that the Trustee determines may be unduly prejudicial to the rights of other Holders (it being understood that the Trustee does not have an affirmative duty to determine whether any direction is prejudicial to any Holder) or may involve the Trustee in liability. Prior to taking any action under this Indenture, the Trustee is entitled to security and indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense to the Trustee that may result from the Trustee’s following such direction.
- 73 -
Section 7.07. Limitation on Suits.
No Holder may pursue any remedy with respect to this Indenture or the Notes (except to enforce (x) its rights to receive the principal of, or the Redemption Price, Fundamental Change Repurchase Price or Optional Repurchase Price for, or interest on, any Notes; or (y) the Company’s obligations to convert any Notes pursuant to
Article 5
), unless:
(A)    such Holder has previously delivered to the Trustee notice that an Event of Default is continuing;
(B)    Holders of at least twenty five percent (25%) in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding deliver a written request to the Trustee to pursue such remedy;
(C)    such Holder or Holders offer and, if requested, provide to the Trustee security and indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee against any loss, liability or expense to the Trustee that may result from the Trustee’s following such request;
(D)    the Trustee does not comply with such request within sixty (60) calendar days after its receipt of such request and such offer of security or indemnity; and
(E)    during such sixty (60) calendar day period, Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding do not deliver to the Trustee a direction that is inconsistent with such request.
A Holder of a Note may not use this Indenture to prejudice the rights of another Holder or to obtain a preference or priority over another Holder. The Trustee will have no duty to determine whether any Holder’s use of this Indenture complies with the preceding sentence.
Section 7.08. Absolute Right of Holders to Institute Suit for the Enforcement of the Right to Receive Payment and Conversion Consideration.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Indenture or the Notes (but without limiting
Section 8.01
), the right of each Holder of a Note to bring suit for the enforcement of any payment or delivery, as applicable, of the principal of, or the Redemption Price, Fundamental Change Repurchase Price or Optional Repurchase Price for, or any interest on, or the Conversion Consideration due pursuant to
Article 5
upon conversion of, such Note on or after the respective due dates therefor provided in this Indenture and the Notes, will not be impaired or affected without the consent of such Holder.
- 74 -
Section 7.09. Collection Suit by Trustee.
The Trustee will have the right, upon the occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default pursuant to
clause (i)
,
(ii)
or
(iv)
of
Section 7.01(A)
, to recover judgment in its own name and as trustee of an express trust against the Company for the total unpaid or undelivered principal of, or Redemption Price, Fundamental Change Repurchase Price or Optional Repurchase Price for, or interest on, or Conversion Consideration due pursuant to
Article 5
upon conversion of, the Notes, as applicable, and, to the extent lawful, any Default Interest on any Defaulted Amounts, and such further amounts sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including compensation provided for in
Section 10.06
.
Section 7.10. Trustee May File Proofs of Claim.
The Trustee has the right to (A) file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee and the Holders allowed in any judicial proceedings relative to the Company (or any other obligor upon the Notes) or its creditors or property and (B) collect, receive and distribute any money or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims. Each Holder authorizes any custodian in such proceeding to make such payments to the Trustee, and, if the Trustee consents to the making of such payments directly to the Holders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due to the Trustee for the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, and its agents and counsel, and any other amounts payable to the Trustee pursuant to
Section 10.06
. To the extent that the payment of any such compensation, expenses, disbursements, advances and other amounts out of the estate in such proceeding, is denied for any reason, payment of the same will be secured by a lien on, and will be paid out of, any and all distributions, dividends, money, securities and other properties that the Holders may be entitled to receive in such proceeding (whether in liquidation or under any plan of reorganization or arrangement or otherwise). Nothing in this Indenture will be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize, consent to, accept or adopt on behalf of any Holder any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Notes or the rights of any Holder, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding.
Section 7.11. Priorities.

Article 7

Alternatively, at its discretion, the Company may, in exchange for such Note, issue, execute and deliver, and the Trustee will authenticate, in each case in accordance with
Section 2.02
, a new Note that reflects the changed terms. The failure to make any appropriate notation or issue a new Note pursuant to this
Section 8.05
will not impair or affect the validity of such amendment, supplement or waiver.

The Trustee will execute and deliver any amendment or supplemental indenture authorized pursuant to this

- 80 -
Section 9.03. Reinstatement.

Section 9.01
will be rescinded;
provided
,
however
, that if the Company thereafter pays or delivers any cash or other property due on the Notes to the Holders thereof, then the Company will be subrogated to the rights of such Holders to receive such cash or other property from the cash or other property, if any, held by the Trustee, the Paying Agent or the Conversion Agent, as applicable.

(ii)    in the absence of bad faith or willful misconduct on its part, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon Officer’s Certificates or Opinions of Counsel that are provided to the Trustee and conform to the requirements of this Indenture. However, the Trustee will examine the certificates and opinions to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this Indenture (but need not confirm or investigate the accuracy of mathematical calculations or other facts stated therein).
(C)    The Trustee may not be relieved from liabilities for its negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a final non-appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction, except that:

- 81 -
(D)    Each provision of this Indenture that in any way relates to the Trustee is subject to paragraphs
(A)
,
(B)
and
(C)
of this
Section 10.01

provided
,
however
, that if the Trustee acquires a “conflicting interest” (within the meaning of Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act), then it must eliminate such conflict within ninety (90) days or resign as Trustee. Each Note Agent will have the same rights and duties as the Trustee under this

provided
,
however
, that, except in the case of a Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of, or interest on, any Note, or a default in the payment or delivery of the Conversion Consideration, the Trustee may withhold such notice if and for so long as it in good faith determines that withholding such notice is in the interests of the Holders. For the avoidance of doubt, the Trustee will not be required to deliver such notice at any time after such Default or Event of Default is cured or waived. The Trustee will not be deemed to have notice or be charged with knowledge of any Default or Event of Default unless (A) written notice thereof has been received by a Responsible Officer; and (B) such notice references the Notes and this Indenture and states on its face that a Default or Event of Default has occurred.

(B)    The Company will indemnify the Trustee (in each of its capacities) against any and all losses, liabilities or expenses incurred by it arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of its duties under this Indenture, including the costs and expenses of enforcing this Indenture against the Company (including this
Section 10.06
) and defending itself against any claim (whether asserted by the Company, any Holder or any other Person) or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its powers or duties under this Indenture, except to the extent any such loss, liability or expense may be attributable to its negligence or willful misconduct, as determined by a final, non-appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction. The Trustee will promptly notify the Company of any claim for which it may seek indemnity, but the Trustee’s failure to so notify the Company will not relieve the Company of its obligations under this
Section 10.06(B)
, except to the extent the Company is materially prejudiced by such failure. The Company will defend such claim, and the Trustee will cooperate in such defense. If the Trustee is advised by counsel that it may have defenses available to it that are in conflict with the defenses available to the Company, or that there is an actual or potential conflict of interest, then the Trustee may retain separate counsel, and the Company will pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel (including the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the Trustee incurred in evaluating whether such a conflict exists). The Company need not pay for any settlement of any such claim made without its consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld.
(C)    The obligations of the Company under this
Section 10.06
will survive the resignation or removal of the Trustee and the discharge of this Indenture.
(D)    To secure the Company’s payment obligations in this
Section 10.06
, the Trustee will have a lien prior to the Notes on all money or property held or collected by the Trustee, except that held in trust to pay principal of, or interest on, particular Notes, which lien will survive the discharge of this Indenture.
(E)    If the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services after an Event of Default pursuant to
clause (viii)
or
(ix)
of
Section 7.01(A)
occurs, then such expenses and the compensation for such services (including the fees and expenses of its agents and counsel) are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any Bankruptcy Law.
- 85 -
Section 10.07. Replacement of the Trustee.
(A)    Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 10.07
, a resignation or removal of the Trustee, and the appointment of a successor Trustee, will become effective only upon such successor Trustee’s acceptance of appointment as provided in this
Section 10.07
.
(B)    The Trustee may resign at any time and be discharged from the trust created by this Indenture by so notifying the Company. The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may remove the Trustee by so notifying the Trustee and the Company in writing.

(i)    the Trustee fails to comply with
Section 10.09
;
(ii)    the Trustee is adjudged to be bankrupt or insolvent or an order for relief is entered with respect to the Trustee under any Bankruptcy Law;
(iii)    a custodian or public officer takes charge of the Trustee or its property; or
(iv)    the Trustee becomes incapable of acting.

(D)    If a successor Trustee does not take office within sixty (60) days after the retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, then the retiring Trustee, the Company or the Holders of at least ten percent (10%) in aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee.
(E)    If the Trustee, after written request by a Holder of at least six (6) months (or, such lesser period since the Issue Date), fails to comply with
Section 10.09
, then such Holder may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee.
(F)    A successor Trustee will deliver a written acceptance of its appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Company, upon which notice the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee will become effective and the successor Trustee will have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee under this Indenture. The successor Trustee will send notice of its succession to Holders. The retiring Trustee will, upon payment of all amounts due to it under this Indenture, promptly transfer all property held by it as Trustee to the successor Trustee, which property will, for the avoidance of doubt, be subject to the lien provided for in
Section 10.06(D)
.
