the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:
1.
Resale Shelf Registration
Rights
.
(a)
Registration
Statement Covering Resale of Registrable Securities
. In accordance with
Section 2
, on each of the Closing Date, the Second
Payment Date, the Third Payment Date and the Fourth Payment Date, the Parent shall prepare and file, or cause to be prepared and filed,
with the Commission a prospectus supplement pursuant to Rule 424(b)(7) promulgated under the Securities Act (each, a “
Prosupp
”)
to its Current Resale Shelf Registration Statement, providing for the resale from time to time by the Holders of any and all Registrable
Securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act (or any successor or similar provision adopted by the Commission then in effect),
and each such Prosupp shall further provide that such Registrable Securities may be sold pursuant to any method or combination of methods
legally available to the Holders, including in customary market and brokerage trades through any national exchange or over the counter
market. The Parent shall use its best efforts to maintain the Current Resale Shelf Registration Statement in accordance with the terms
hereof and keep the Current Resale Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective and shall cause the Current Resale Shelf Registration
Statement to be supplemented and amended (including post-effective amendments) to the extent necessary to ensure that such Registration
Statement is available or, if not available, to ensure that another Registration Statement is available and effective under the Securities
Act at all times until the first date on which there are no longer any Registrable Securities outstanding (the “
Effectiveness
Period
”).
(b)
Notification;
Replacement Registration Statement on Form S-3; and Distribution of Materials
. The Parent shall notify the Holders in writing of the
filing of each Prosupp immediately following the filing thereof with the Commission, and the Parent shall notify the Holders in writing
immediately following the Current Resale Shelf Registration Statement no longer being current or otherwise available to the Holders as
provided by
Section 1(a)
. If the Current Resale Shelf Registration Statement becomes unavailable for the use by the Holders because
the Parent is no longer eligible to use an Automatic Shelf Registration Statement, then the Parent shall promptly (and in any event within
five Business Days following the unavailability of such Registration Statement) file with the Commission a replacement Registration Statement
on such form as it is then currently able to use (which shall be Form S-3 if the Parent is then able to use such form), and the Parent
shall use its best efforts to have such replacement Registration Statement declared effective by the Commission as soon as possible after
such filing, which replacement Registration Statement shall provide for the resale from time to time by the Holders of any and all Registrable
Securities pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act (or any successor or similar provision adopted by the Commission then in effect),
and the Prospectus contained therein shall further provide that such Registrable Securities may be sold pursuant to any method or combination
of methods legally available to the Holders, including in customary market and brokerage trades through any national exchange or over
the counter market. The Parent shall notify the Holders of the effectiveness of such replacement Registration Statement as soon as practicable,
and in any event within one (1) Business Day after the Registration Statement becomes effective, and shall furnish to them, without charge,
such number of copies of such Registration Statement (including any amendments, supplements and exhibits), the Prospectus contained therein
(including each preliminary prospectus and all related amendments and supplements) and any documents incorporated by reference in such
Shelf Registration Statement or such other documents as the Holders may reasonably request in order to facilitate the sale of the Registrable
Securities in the manner described in such Registration Statement. The Parent shall use its best efforts to maintain such replacement
Registration Statement in accordance with the terms hereof and keep such Registration Statement continuously effective and shall cause
such Registration Statement to be supplemented and amended (including post-effective amendments) to the extent necessary to ensure that
such Registration Statement is available or, if not available, to ensure that another Registration Statement is available and effective
under the Securities Act at all times during the Effectiveness Period.
(c)
Amendments
and Supplements
. Subject to the provisions of
Section 1(a)
above, the Parent shall promptly prepare and file with the Commission
from time to time such amendments and supplements to the Current Resale Shelf Registration Statement and Prospectus used in connection
therewith as may be necessary to keep the Current Resale Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective and to comply with the provisions
of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all the Registrable Securities during the Effectiveness Period. If any Registration
Statement filed pursuant to
Section 1(b)
is filed on Form S-3 and thereafter the Parent becomes ineligible to use Form S-3 for
secondary sales, then the Parent shall promptly notify the Holders of such ineligibility and shall file with the Commission a shelf registration
on Form S-1 or other appropriate form as promptly as practicable (but in all events no later than fifteen (15) days thereafter) to replace
the shelf registration statement on Form S-3 and use its best efforts to have such replacement Registration Statement declared effective
as promptly as practicable and to cause such replacement Registration Statement to remain effective, and shall cause the Registration
Statement to be supplemented and amended to the extent necessary to ensure that such Registration Statement is continuously available
or, if not available, that another Registration Statement is available, for the resale of all the Registrable Securities held by the Holders
during the Effectiveness Period;
provided, however
, that at any time the Parent once again becomes eligible to use Form S-3, the
Parent shall, as promptly as practicable, cause such replacement Resale Shelf Registration Statement to be amended, or shall file a new
replacement Registration Statement, such that the Registration Statement is once again on Form S-3.
2
(d) Notwithstanding
the registration obligations set forth in this
Section 1
, in the event the Commission informs the Parent that all of the Registrable
Securities cannot, as a result of the application of Rule 415, be registered for resale as a secondary offering on a single registration
statement, the Parent agrees to promptly (i) inform each of the Holders thereof and shall file amendments to the Resale Shelf Registration
Statement as required by the Commission and/or (ii) withdraw the applicable Registration Statement and file a new registration statement
(a “
New Registration Statement
”), on Form S-3, or if Form S-3 is not then available to the Parent for such registration
statement, on such other form available to register for resale the Registrable Securities as a secondary offering;
provided, however
,
that prior to filing such amendment or New Registration Statement, the Parent shall advocate with the Commission for the registration
of all of the Registrable Securities in accordance with any publicly-available written or oral guidance, comments, requirements or requests
of the Commission staff (the “
SEC Guidance
”), including without limitation, the Manual of Publicly Available Telephone
Interpretations D.29 and successor guidance. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if any SEC Guidance sets forth a limitation
of the number of Registrable Securities permitted to be registered on a particular Registration Statement as a secondary offering (and
notwithstanding that the Parent used diligent efforts to advocate with the Commission for the registration of all or a greater number
of Registrable Securities in accordance with the preceding sentence), unless otherwise directed in writing by a Holder as to its Registrable
Securities, the number of Registrable Securities to be registered on such Registration Statement will be reduced on a pro rata basis based
on the total number of Registrable Securities held by the Holders, subject to a determination by the Commission that certain Holders’
amount of Registrable Securities must be reduced first based on the number of Registrable Securities held by such Holders. In the event
the Parent amends the applicable Registration Statement or files a New Registration Statement, as the case may be, under clauses (i) or
(ii) above, the Parent shall file with the Commission, as promptly as allowed by Commission or SEC Guidance provided to the Parent or
to registrants of securities in general, one or more Registration Statements on Form S-3 or such other form available to register for
resale those Registrable Securities that were not registered for resale on the applicable Registration Statement, as amended, or the New
Registration Statement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the Parent shall not name any Holder as
an underwriter (as defined in Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act) in any Registration Statement without such Holder’s written
consent.
2.

Section 1
, the Parent shall expeditiously as reasonably
possible:
(a) without derogating from
the Parent’s obligations contained in
Section 1

regulations promulgated thereunder and file with the Commission a Registration Statement, and all amendments and supplements thereto and
related prospectuses as may be necessary to comply with applicable securities laws, with respect to such Registrable Securities and use

and file with the Commission such amendments and supplements to a Registration Statement and the prospectus used in connection therewith

in accordance with the intended methods of disposition by the Holders as set forth in such registration statement;
(d) furnish
to each Holder such number of copies of such Registration Statement, each amendment and supplement thereto, the prospectus included in

(e) during

in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this
Section 2(f)
, (ii) consent to general
service of process in any such jurisdiction or (iii) subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction);
(g) promptly
notify in writing each seller of such Registrable Securities (i) after it receives notice thereof, of the date and time when such Registration
Statement and each post-effective amendment thereto has become effective or a prospectus or supplement to any prospectus relating to a
Registration Statement has been filed and when any registration or qualification has become effective under a state securities or blue
sky law or any exemption thereunder has been obtained, (ii) after receipt thereof, of any request by the Commission for the amendment
or supplementing of such Registration Statement or prospectus or for additional information, and (iii) at any time when a prospectus
relating thereto is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, of the happening of any event as a result of which the prospectus
included in such Registration Statement contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits any fact necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading, and, the Parent promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) shall prepare, file with the Commission
and furnish to each Holder (upon request) a reasonable number of copies of a supplement or amendment to such Prospectus so that, as thereafter
delivered to the purchasers of such Registrable Securities, such Prospectus shall not contain an untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading;
4
(h) cause
all such Registrable Securities to be listed on each securities exchange on which similar securities issued by the Parent are then listed
and, if not so listed, to be listed on a securities exchange and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to arrange for at
least two market makers to register as such with respect to such Registrable Securities with FINRA;
(i) provide
a transfer agent and registrar for all such Registrable Securities not later than the effective date of such registration statement;
(j) make
available for inspection by any Holder of Registrable Securities, any underwriter participating in any disposition pursuant to such Registration

and cause the Parent’s officers, managers, directors, employees, agents, representatives and independent accountants to supply all
information reasonably requested by any such seller, underwriter, attorney, accountant or agent in connection with such registration statement;
(k) otherwise
use its best efforts to comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the Commission;
(l) in
the event of the issuance of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of a Registration Statement, or of any order suspending or preventing
the use of any related Prospectus or suspending the qualification of any Common Stock included in such Registration Statement for sale
in any jurisdiction, the Parent shall use its best efforts promptly to obtain the withdrawal of such order;
(m) use
its commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Registrable Securities covered by such Registration Statement to be registered with
or approved by such other governmental agencies or authorities as may be necessary to enable the sellers thereof to consummate the disposition
of such Registrable Securities;
5
(n) cooperate
with the Holders of Registrable Securities covered by the Registration Statement to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of
certificates representing securities to be sold under the Registration Statement;

Registrable Securities is not effected pursuant to
Section 1(a)

Section 1(b)
or
Section
1(c)
, dated as of the effective date of such Registration Statement (substantially in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit A
,
the “
Form of Opinion
”), with respect to the Registration Statement, each amendment and supplement thereto, the prospectus
included therein (including the preliminary prospectus) and such other documents relating thereto in customary form and covering such
matters of the type customarily covered by legal opinions of such nature;
(q) if
the Parent files an Automatic Shelf Registration Statement covering any Registrable Securities, use its commercially reasonable efforts
to remain a WKSI (and not become an ineligible issuer (as defined in Rule 405)) during the Effectiveness Period;
(r) if
an Automatic Shelf Registration Statement has been outstanding for at least three (3) years, at the end of the third year, refile a new
Automatic Shelf Registration Statement covering the Registrable Securities, and, if at any time when the Parent is required to re-evaluate
its WKSI status the Parent determines that it is not a WKSI, use its commercially reasonable efforts to refile the registration statement
on Form S-3 and keep such Registration Statement effective (including by filing a new Resale Shelf Registration Statement or replacement
Resale Shelf Registration Statement, if necessary) during the Effectiveness Period;
(s) if
reasonably requested by a Holder, (i) incorporate in a prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment such information as such Holder

all salaries and expenses of its officers and employees performing legal or accounting duties), the expense of any annual audit or quarterly
review, and the expenses and fees for listing the Registrable Securities on each securities exchange on which similar securities issued

5.
Indemnification
.
(a) The
Parent agrees to (i) indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by law, each Holder and such Holder’s officers,
directors, members, partners, agents, affiliates and employees and each Person who controls such Holder (within the meaning of the Securities
Act or the Exchange Act) against all losses, claims, actions, damages, liabilities and expenses related to or arising out of (A) any untrue
or alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in any registration statement, prospectus or preliminary prospectus or any amendment
thereof or supplement thereto or any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein not misleading, or (B) any violation or alleged violation by the Parent of the Securities Act or any other similar
federal or state securities laws or any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder applicable to the Parent and relating to action or inaction
required of the Parent in connection with any such registration, qualification or compliance, and (ii) pay to each Holder and such Holder’s
officers, directors, members, partners, agents, affiliates and employees and each Person who controls such Holder (within the meaning
of the Securities Act or the Exchange Act), as incurred, all legal and any other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating,
preparing or defending any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action, except insofar as the same are caused by or contained in any
information furnished in writing to the Parent or any managing underwriter by such Holders expressly for use therein;
provided, however
,
that the indemnity agreement contained in this
Section 5
shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such claim, loss,
damage, liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), nor shall the Parent be liable in any such case for any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action
to the extent that it solely arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement of any material fact contained in the Registration Statement
or omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,
in each case to the extent that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission was made in the Registration
Statement, in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished by such Holder expressly for use in connection with such
Registration Statement. In connection with an underwritten offering, the Parent shall indemnify any underwriters or deemed underwriters,
their officers and directors and each Person who controls such underwriters (within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange
Act) to the same extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification of the Holders of Registrable Securities.
7
(b) In
connection with any Registration Statement in which a Holder of Registrable Securities is participating, (1) each such Holder shall furnish
to the Parent in writing such information as the Parent reasonably requests for use in connection with any such registration statement
or prospectus and, (2) to the extent permitted by law, shall indemnify the Parent, its officers, directors, employees, agents and representatives
and each Person who controls the Parent (within the meaning of the Securities Act) against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
expenses resulting from any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in the Registration Statement, prospectus or
preliminary prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but only to the extent that such untrue statement or
omission is contained in any information expressly furnished in writing by such holder to the Parent for use in a Registration Statement;
provided that the foregoing obligation to indemnify shall be individual to such Holder, and not joint and several among the Holders, and
shall be limited to the net amount of proceeds actually received by such Holder from the sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to such
registration statement.
(c) Any
Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall (i) give prompt written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect
to which it seeks indemnification (provided that the failure to give prompt notice shall not impair any Person’s right to indemnification
hereunder except to the extent such failure has materially prejudiced the indemnifying party) and (ii) unless in such indemnified party’s
reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying parties may exist with respect to such claim, permit
such indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party. If such defense
is assumed, the indemnifying party shall not be subject to any liability for any settlement made by the indemnified party without its
consent (but such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). An indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or
elects not to, assume the defense of a claim shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (as well as
one local counsel) for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party with respect to such claim, unless in the reasonable judgment
of any indemnified party a conflict of interest may exist between such indemnified party and any other of such indemnified parties with
respect to such claim. In such instance, the conflicted indemnified parties shall have a right to retain one separate counsel, chosen
by the holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities included in the registration, at the expense of the indemnifying party. No
indemnifying party, in the defense of such claim or litigation, shall, except with the consent of each indemnified party, consent to the
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant
or plaintiff to such indemnified party of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation.
(d) Each
party hereto agrees that, if for any reason the indemnification provisions contemplated by
Sections 5(a)
or
5(b)
are unavailable
to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions
in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, shall contribute
to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions
in respect thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and the indemnified party
in connection with the actions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other relevant
equitable considerations. The relative fault of such indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among
other things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged
omission to state a material fact, relates to information supplied by such indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the parties’
relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The parties hereto
agree that it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this
Section 5(d)
were determined by pro rata allocation
(even if the holders or any underwriters or all of them were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation
which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in this
Section 5(d)
. The amount paid or payable by an
indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions in respect thereof) referred to above
shall be deemed to include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating
or, except as provided in
Section 5(c)
, defending any such action or claim. No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within
the meaning of Section 10(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation. The sellers’ obligations in this
Section 5(d)
to contribute shall be several in proportion to the amount
of securities registered by them and not joint and shall be limited to an amount equal to the net proceeds actually received by such seller
from the sale of Registrable Securities effected pursuant to such registration.
8
(e) The
indemnification and contribution provided for under this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation
made by or on behalf of the indemnified party or any officer, director or controlling Person of such indemnified party and shall survive
the transfer of Registrable Securities and the termination or expiration of this Agreement.
6.
Other
Agreements; Certain Limitations on Registration Rights
. The Parent shall file all reports required to be filed by it under the Securities
Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations adopted by the Commission thereunder and shall take such further action as the
Holders may reasonably request, all to the extent required to enable such Persons to sell securities pursuant to (a) Rule 144 or (b) a
Registration Statement on Form S-3 or any similar registration form hereafter adopted by the Commission. Upon request, the Parent shall
promptly deliver to the Holders a written statement as to whether it has complied with such requirements. The Parent shall at all times
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the securities registered or to be registered pursuant hereto to be listed, or continue
to be listed, on one or more of the Nasdaq Stock Market, the New York Stock Exchange, or the NYSE American.
