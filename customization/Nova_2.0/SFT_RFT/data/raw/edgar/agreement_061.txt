Exercise
.
a)
Exercise of
Warrant
. Exercise of the purchase rights represented by this Warrant may be made, in whole or in part, at any time or times on or
after the Initial Exercise Date and on or before the Termination Date by delivery to the Company of a duly executed PDF copy submitted
by e-mail (or e-mail attachment) of the Notice of Exercise in the form annexed hereto as
Exhibit A
(the “
Notice of Exercise
”).
Within the earlier of (i) one (1) Trading Day and (ii) the number of Trading Days comprising the Standard Settlement Period (as defined
in Section 2(d)(i) herein) following the date of exercise as aforesaid, the Holder shall deliver the aggregate Exercise Price for the
number of Warrant Depositary Shares specified in the applicable Notice of Exercise by wire transfer or cashier’s check drawn on
a United States bank unless the cashless exercise procedure specified in Section 2(c) below is specified in the applicable Notice of Exercise.
No ink-original Notice of Exercise shall be required, nor shall any medallion guarantee (or other type of guarantee or notarization) of
any Notice of Exercise be required. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Holder shall not be required to physically surrender
this Warrant to the Company until the Holder has purchased all of the Warrant Depositary Shares available hereunder and the Warrant has
been exercised in full, in which case, the Holder shall surrender this Warrant to the Company for cancellation within three (3) Trading
Days of the date on which the final Notice of Exercise is delivered to the Company. Partial exercises of this Warrant resulting in purchases
of a portion of the total number of Warrant Depositary Shares available hereunder shall have the effect of lowering the outstanding number
of Warrant Depositary Shares purchasable hereunder in an amount equal to the applicable number of Warrant Depositary Shares purchased.
The Holder and the Company shall maintain records showing the number of Warrant Depositary Shares purchased and the date of such purchases.
The Company shall deliver any objection to any Notice of Exercise on the Trading Day of receipt of such notice.
The Holder and any
assignee, by acceptance of this Warrant, acknowledge and agree that, by reason of the provisions of this paragraph, following the purchase
of a portion of the Warrant Depositary Shares hereunder, the number of Warrant Depositary Shares available for purchase hereunder at any
given time may be less than the amount stated on the face hereof.
2
b)
Exercise Price
.
The exercise price per Warrant Depositary Share under this Warrant shall be $[_____], subject to adjustment hereunder (the “
Exercise
Price
”).
c)
Cashless Exercise
.
If at the time of exercise hereof there is no effective registration statement registering, or the prospectus contained therein is not
available for the issuance of the Warrant Depositary Shares to the Holder, then this Warrant may also be exercised, in whole or in part,
at such time by means of a “cashless exercise” in which the Holder shall be entitled to receive a number of Warrant Depositary
Shares equal to the quotient obtained by dividing [(A-B) (X)] by (A), where:
(A)
= as applicable: (i) the VWAP on the Trading Day immediately preceding the date of the applicable Notice of Exercise if such Notice of Exercise is (1) delivered pursuant to Section 2(a) hereof on a day that is not a Trading Day or (2) delivered pursuant to Section 2(a) hereof on a Trading Day prior to the opening of “regular trading hours” (as defined in Rule 600(b) of Regulation NMS promulgated under the federal securities laws) on such Trading Day, (ii) the highest Bid Price of the Depositary Shares on the principal Trading Market as reported by Bloomberg within two (2) hours of the time of the Holder’s delivery of the Notice of Exercise pursuant to Section 2(a) hereof if such Notice of Exercise is delivered during “regular trading hours,” or within two (2) hours after the close of “regular trading hours,” on a Trading Day or (iii) the VWAP on the date of the applicable Notice of Exercise if the date of such Notice of Exercise is a Trading Day and such Notice of Exercise is delivered pursuant to Section 2(a) hereof after two (2) hours following the close of “regular trading hours” on such Trading Day;
(B)
= the Exercise Price of this Warrant, as adjusted hereunder; and
(X)
= the number of Warrant Depositary Shares that would be issuable upon exercise of this Warrant in accordance with the terms of this Warrant if such exercise were by means of a cash exercise rather than a cashless exercise.
If Warrant Depositary
Shares are issued in such a cashless exercise, the parties acknowledge and agree that in accordance with Section 3(a)(9) of the Securities
Act, the Warrant Depositary Shares shall take on the registered characteristics of the Warrants being exercised. The Company agrees not
to take any position contrary to this Section 2(c).
Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, the Holder may also effect an “zero cash exercise” following the Initial Exercise Date. In
such event, the aggregate number of Warrant Depositary Shares issuable in such zero cash exercise pursuant to any given Notice of Exercise
electing to effect a zero cash exercise shall equal the product of (x) the aggregate number of Warrant Depositary Shares that would be
issuable upon exercise of this Warrant in accordance with the terms of this Warrant if such exercise were by means of a cash exercise
rather than a cashless exercise and (y) 2.0.
3
d)
Mechanics
of Exercise
.
i.
Delivery of Warrant Depositary Shares Upon Exercise
. The Company shall cause the Warrant Depositary Shares purchased hereunder to be transmitted by the Transfer Agent to the Holder by crediting the account of the Holder’s or its designee’s balance account with The Depository Trust Company through its Deposit or Withdrawal at Custodian system (“
DWAC
”) if the Company is then a participant in such system and either (A) there is an effective registration statement permitting the issuance of the Warrant Depositary Shares to, or resale of the Warrant Depositary Shares by, Holder or (B) this Warrant is being exercised via cashless exercise or zero cash exercise and otherwise by physical delivery of a certificate, registered in the Company’s share register in the name of the Holder or its designee, for the number of Warrant Depositary Shares to which the Holder is entitled pursuant to such exercise to the address specified by the Holder in the Notice of Exercise by the date that is the earlier of (i) one (1) Trading Day after the delivery to the Company of the Notice of Exercise and (ii) the number of Trading Days comprising the Standard Settlement Period after the delivery to the Company of the Notice of Exercise (such date, the “
Warrant Share Delivery Date
”). Upon delivery of the Notice of Exercise, the Holder shall be deemed for all corporate purposes to have become the holder of record of the Warrant Depositary Shares with respect to which this Warrant has been exercised, irrespective of the date of delivery of the Warrant Depositary Shares, provided that payment of the aggregate Exercise Price (other than in the case of a cashless exercise or zero cash exercise) is received within the earlier of (i) one (1) Trading Day and (ii) the number of Trading Days comprising the Standard Settlement Period following delivery of the Notice of Exercise. If the Company fails for any reason to deliver to the Holder the Warrant Depositary Shares subject to a Notice of Exercise by the Warrant Share Delivery Date, the Company shall pay to the Holder, in cash, as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, for each $1,000 of Warrant Depositary Shares subject to such exercise (based on the VWAP of the Depositary Shares on the date of the applicable Notice of Exercise), $10 per Trading Day (increasing to $20 per Trading Day on the third Trading Day after the Warrant Share Delivery Date) for each Trading Day after such Warrant Share Delivery Date until such Warrant Depositary Shares are delivered or Holder rescinds such exercise. The Company agrees to maintain a transfer agent that is a participant in the FAST program so long as this Warrant remains outstanding and exercisable. As used herein, “
Standard Settlement Period
” means the standard settlement period, expressed in a number of Trading Days, on the Company’s primary Trading Market with respect to the Depositary Shares as in effect on the date of delivery of the Notice of Exercise.
ii.
Delivery of New Warrants Upon Exercise
. If this Warrant shall have been exercised in part, the Company shall, at the request of a Holder and upon surrender of this Warrant certificate, at the time of delivery of the Warrant Depositary Shares, deliver to the Holder a new Warrant evidencing the rights of the Holder to purchase the unpurchased Warrant Depositary Shares called for by this Warrant, which new Warrant shall in all other respects be identical with this Warrant.
iii.
Rescission Rights
. If the Company fails to cause the Transfer Agent to transmit to the Holder the Warrant Depositary Shares pursuant to Section 2(d)(i) by the Warrant Share Delivery Date, then the Holder will have the right to rescind such exercise.
iv.
Compensation for Buy-In on Failure to Timely Deliver Warrant Depositary Shares Upon Exercise
. In addition to any other rights available to the Holder, if the Company fails to cause the Transfer Agent to transmit to the Holder the Warrant Depositary Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 2(d)(i) above pursuant to an exercise on or before the Warrant Share Delivery Date (other than a failure caused by incorrect or incomplete information provided by the Holder to the Company), and if after such date the Holder is required by its broker to purchase (in an open market transaction or otherwise) or the Holder’s brokerage firm otherwise purchases, Depositary Shares to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by the Holder of the Warrant Depositary Shares which the Holder anticipated receiving upon such exercise (a “
Buy-In
”), then the Company shall (A)
provided
that if the Depositary Shares are then listed or quoted on the Trading Market or any over-the-counter market (including OTC Pink or any successor) such price set forth in (y)(2) of this clause (A) is reasonably comparable to a market price or prices in purchases and sales of the Depositary Shares occurring in the market on or close in time to the Trading Day on which the Holder’s purchase occurred taking into account the volume of the Holder’s purchase, pay in cash to the Holder the amount, if any, by which (x) the Holder’s total purchase price (including brokerage commissions, if any) for the Depositary Shares so purchased exceeds (y) the amount obtained by multiplying (1) the number of Warrant Depositary Shares that the Company was required to deliver to the Holder in connection with the exercise at issue times (2) the price at which the sell order giving rise to such purchase obligation was executed, and (B) at the option of the Holder, either reinstate the portion of the Warrant and equivalent number of Warrant Depositary Shares for which such exercise was not honored (in which case such exercise shall be deemed rescinded) or deliver to the Holder the number of Depositary Shares that would have been issued had the Company timely complied with its exercise and delivery obligations hereunder. For example, if the Holder purchases Depositary Shares having a total purchase price of $11,000 to cover a Buy-In with respect to an attempted exercise of Depositary Shares with an aggregate sale price giving rise to such purchase obligation of $10,000, under clause (A) of the immediately preceding sentence the Company shall be required to pay the Holder $1,000. The Holder shall provide the Company written notice indicating the amounts payable to the Holder in respect of the Buy-In and, upon request of the Company, evidence of the amount of such loss. Nothing herein shall limit a Holder’s right to pursue any other remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief with respect to the Company’s failure to timely deliver Depositary Shares upon exercise of the Warrant as required pursuant to the terms hereof.
4
v.
No Fractional Shares or Scrip
. No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares shall be issued upon the exercise of this Warrant. As to any fraction of a share which the Holder would otherwise be entitled to purchase upon such exercise, the Company shall, at its election, either pay a cash adjustment in respect of such final fraction in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by the Exercise Price or round up to the next whole share.
vi.
Charges, Taxes and Expenses
. Issuance of Warrant Depositary Shares shall be made without charge to the Holder for any issue or transfer tax or other incidental expense in respect of the issuance of such Warrant Depositary Shares, all of which taxes and expenses shall be paid by the Company, and such Warrant Depositary Shares shall be issued in the name of the Holder or in such name or names as may be directed by the Holder;
provided
,
however
, that, in the event that Warrant Depositary Shares are to be issued in a name other than the name of the Holder, this Warrant when surrendered for exercise shall be accompanied by the Assignment Form attached hereto as
Exhibit B
duly executed by the Holder and the Company may require, as a condition thereto, the payment of a sum sufficient to reimburse it for any transfer tax incidental thereto. The Company shall pay all Transfer Agent fees required for same-day processing of any Notice of Exercise and all fees to the Depository Trust Company (or another established clearing corporation performing similar functions) required for same-day electronic delivery of the Warrant Depositary Shares.
vii.
Closing of Books
. The Company will not close its shareholders books or records in any manner which prevents the timely exercise of this Warrant, pursuant to the terms hereof.
e)
Holder’s
Exercise Limitations
. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company shall not effect any exercise of this Warrant,
and a Holder shall not have the right to exercise any portion of this Warrant, pursuant to Section 2 or otherwise, to the extent that
after giving effect to such issuance after exercise as set forth on the applicable Notice of Exercise, the Holder (together with the Holder’s
Affiliates, and any other Persons acting as a group together with the Holder or any of the Holder’s Affiliates (such Persons, “
Attribution
Parties
”)), would beneficially own in excess of the Beneficial Ownership Limitation (as defined below). For purposes of the
foregoing sentence, the number of Ordinary Shares beneficially owned by the Holder and its Affiliates and Attribution Parties shall include
the number of Ordinary Shares underlying the Depositary Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant with respect to which such determination
is being made, but shall exclude the number of Ordinary Shares underlying the Depositary Shares which would be issuable upon (i) exercise
of the remaining, nonexercised portion of this Warrant beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its Affiliates or Attribution Parties
and (ii) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or nonconverted portion of any other securities of the Company (including, without
limitation, any other Ordinary Share Equivalents) subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation contained
herein beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its Affiliates or Attribution Parties. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence,
for purposes of this Section 2(e), beneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, it being acknowledged by the Holder that the Company is not representing to the Holder that
such calculation is in compliance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the Holder is solely responsible for any schedules required
to be filed in accordance therewith. To the extent that the limitation contained in this Section 2(e) applies, the determination of whether
this Warrant is exercisable (in relation to other securities owned by the Holder together with any Affiliates and Attribution Parties)
and of which portion of this Warrant is exercisable shall be in the sole discretion of the Holder, and the submission of a Notice of Exercise
shall be deemed to be the Holder’s determination of whether this Warrant is exercisable (in relation to other securities owned by
the Holder together with any Affiliates and Attribution Parties) and of which portion of this Warrant is exercisable, in each case subject
to the Beneficial Ownership Limitation, and the Company shall have no obligation to verify or confirm the accuracy of such determination
and shall have no liability for exercises of this Warrant that are not in compliance with the Beneficial Ownership Limitation, provided
this limitation of liability shall not apply if the Holder has detrimentally relied on outstanding share information provided by the Company
or the Depositary. In addition, a determination as to any group status as contemplated above shall be determined in accordance with Section
13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. For purposes of this Section 2(e), in determining the
number of outstanding Ordinary Shares, a Holder may rely on the number of outstanding Ordinary Shares as reflected in (A) the Company’s
most recent annual report on Form 20-F, Report on Form 6-K or other public filings filed or furnished with the Commission, as the case
may be, (B) a more recent public announcement by the Company or (C) a more recent written notice by the Company or the Transfer Agent
setting forth the number of Ordinary Shares outstanding. Upon the written or oral request of a Holder, the Company shall within one Trading
Day confirm orally or in writing to the Holder the number of Ordinary Shares then outstanding. In any case, the number of outstanding
Ordinary Shares shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the Company, including this Warrant,
by the Holder or its Affiliates or Attribution Parties since the date as of which such number of outstanding Ordinary Shares was reported.
The “
Beneficial Ownership Limitation
” shall be [4.99/9.99]% of the number of Ordinary Shares outstanding immediately
after giving effect to the issuance of Ordinary Shares underlying the Depositary Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant. The Holder,
upon written notice to the Company, may increase or decrease the Beneficial Ownership Limitation provisions of this Section 2(e), provided
that the Beneficial Ownership Limitation in no event exceeds 9.99% of the number of Ordinary Shares outstanding immediately after giving
effect to the issuance of Warrant Depositary Shares upon exercise of this Warrant held by the Holder and the provisions of this Section
2(e) shall continue to apply. Any increase in the Beneficial Ownership Limitation will not be effective until the 61st day after such
notice is delivered to the Company. The provisions of this paragraph shall be construed and implemented in a manner otherwise than in
strict conformity with the terms of this Section 2(e) to correct this paragraph (or any portion hereof) which may be defective or inconsistent
with the intended Beneficial Ownership Limitation herein contained or to make changes or supplements necessary or desirable to properly
give effect to such limitation. The limitations contained in this paragraph shall apply to a successor holder of this Warrant.

Section 3
.
Certain
Adjustments
.
a)
Share Dividends
and Splits
. If the Company, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding: (i) pays a share dividend or otherwise makes a distribution
or distributions on Depositary Shares or Ordinary Shares or any other equity or equity equivalent securities payable in Depositary Shares
or Ordinary Shares (which, for avoidance of doubt, shall not include any shares issued by the Company upon exercise of this Warrant),
(ii) subdivides outstanding Depositary Shares or Ordinary Shares into a larger number of Depositary Shares or Ordinary Shares, as applicable,
(iii) combines (including by way of reverse share split) outstanding Depositary Shares or Ordinary Shares into a smaller number of Depositary
Shares or Ordinary Shares, as applicable, (iv) issues by reclassification of Depositary Shares, Ordinary Shares or any share capital of
the Company, or (v) proportionally decreases or increases the ratio of Ordinary Shares per Depositary Shares, then in each case the Exercise
Price shall be multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of Depositary Shares (excluding treasury shares, if
any) outstanding immediately before such event and of which the denominator shall be the number of Depositary Shares outstanding immediately
after such event, and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be proportionately adjusted such that the aggregate
Exercise Price of this Warrant shall remain unchanged. Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 3(a) shall become effective immediately
after the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution and shall become effective
immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or re-classification.
b)
Subsequent
Rights Offerings
. In addition to any adjustments pursuant to Section 3(a) above, if at any time the Company grants, issues or sells
any Ordinary Share Equivalents or rights to purchase shares, warrants, securities or other property pro rata to the record holders of
any class of Depositary Shares or Ordinary Shares (the “
Purchase Rights
”), then the Holder will be entitled to acquire,
upon the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which the Holder could have acquired if the Holder had
held the number of Depositary Shares or Ordinary Shares, as applicable, acquirable upon complete exercise of this Warrant (without regard
to any limitations on exercise hereof, including without limitation, the Beneficial Ownership Limitation) immediately before the date
on which a record is taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which
the record holders of Depositary Shares or Ordinary Shares, as applicable, are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such Purchase
Rights (provided, however, that, to the extent that the Holder’s right to participate in any such Purchase Right would result in
the Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation, then the Holder shall not be entitled to participate in such Purchase Right
to such extent (or beneficial ownership of such Depositary Shares or Ordinary Shares, as applicable, as a result of such Purchase Right
to such extent) and such Purchase Right to such extent shall be held in abeyance for the Holder until such time, if ever, as its right
thereto would not result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation).
6
c)
Pro Rata Distributions
.
During such time as this Warrant is outstanding, if the Company shall declare or make any dividend or other distribution of its assets
(or rights to acquire its assets) to holders of Depositary Shares or Ordinary Shares, by way of return of capital or otherwise (including,
without limitation, any distribution of cash, shares or other securities, property or options by way of a dividend, spin off, reclassification,
corporate rearrangement, scheme of arrangement or other similar transaction) (a “
Distribution
”), at any time after
the issuance of this Warrant, then, in each such case, the Holder shall be entitled to participate in such Distribution to the same extent
that the Holder would have participated therein if the Holder had held the number of Depositary Shares or Ordinary Shares acquirable upon
complete exercise of this Warrant (without regard to any limitations on exercise hereof, including without limitation, the Beneficial
Ownership Limitation) immediately before the date of which a record is taken for such Distribution, or, if no such record is taken, the
date as of which the record holders of Depositary Shares or Ordinary Shares are to be determined for the participation in such Distribution
(
provided
,
however
, that, to the extent that the Holder’s right to participate in any such Distribution would result
in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation, then the Holder shall not be entitled to participate in such Distribution
to such extent (or in the beneficial ownership of any Ordinary Shares as a result of such Distribution to such extent) and the portion
of such Distribution shall be held in abeyance for the benefit of the Holder until such time, if ever, as its right thereto would not
result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation).
7
d)
Fundamental
Transaction
. If, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding, (i) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions
effects any merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another Person, (ii) the Company, directly or indirectly, effects any
sale, lease, license, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially all of its assets in one or a series
of related transactions, (iii) any, direct or indirect, purchase offer, tender offer or exchange offer (whether by the Company or another
Person) is completed pursuant to which holders of Ordinary Shares are permitted to sell, tender or exchange their shares for other securities,
cash or property and has been accepted by the holders of greater than 50% of the outstanding Ordinary Shares, (iv) the Company, directly
or indirectly, in one or more related transactions effects any reclassification, reorganization or recapitalization of the Ordinary Shares
or any compulsory share exchange pursuant to which the Ordinary Shares are effectively converted into or exchanged for other securities,
cash or property, or (v) the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions consummates a stock or share purchase
agreement or other business combination (including, without limitation, a reorganization, recapitalization, spin-off, merger or scheme
of arrangement) with another Person or group of Persons whereby such other Person or group acquires greater than 50% of the outstanding
Ordinary Shares (each a “
Fundamental Transaction
”), then, upon any subsequent exercise of this Warrant, the Holder
shall have the right to receive, for each Warrant Depositary Share that would have been issuable upon such exercise immediately prior
to the occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction, at the option of the Holder (without regard to any limitation in Section 2(e) on the
exercise of this Warrant), the number of Ordinary Shares of the successor or acquiring corporation or of the Company, if it is the surviving
corporation, and any additional consideration (the “
Alternate Consideration
”) receivable as a result of such Fundamental
Transaction by a holder of the number of Ordinary Shares underlying the Warrant Depositary Shares for which this Warrant is exercisable
immediately prior to such Fundamental Transaction (without regard to any limitation in Section 2(e) on the exercise of this Warrant).
For purposes of any such exercise, the determination of the Exercise Price shall be appropriately adjusted to apply to such Alternate
Consideration based on the amount of Alternate Consideration issuable in respect of one Ordinary Share in such Fundamental Transaction,
and the Company shall apportion the Exercise Price among the Alternate Consideration in a reasonable manner reflecting the relative value
of any different components of the Alternate Consideration. If holders of Ordinary Shares are given any choice as to the securities, cash
or property to be received in a Fundamental Transaction, then the Holder shall be given the same choice as to the Alternate Consideration
it receives upon any exercise of this Warrant following such Fundamental Transaction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in the
event of a Fundamental Transaction, the Company or any Successor Entity (as defined below) shall, at the Holder’s option, exercisable
at any time concurrently with, or within 30 days after, the consummation of the Fundamental Transaction (or, if later, the date of the
public announcement of the applicable Fundamental Transaction), purchase this Warrant from the Holder by paying to the Holder an amount
of cash equal to the Black Scholes Value (as defined below) of the remaining unexercised portion of this Warrant on the date of the consummation
of such Fundamental Transaction;
provided
,
however
, that, if the Fundamental Transaction is not within the Company’s
control, including not approved by the Company’s Board of Directors, the Holder shall only be entitled to receive from the Company
or any Successor Entity, as of the date of the consummation of such Fundamental Transaction, the same type or form of consideration (and
in the same proportion), at the Black Scholes Value of the unexercised portion of this Warrant, that is being offered and paid to the
holders of Ordinary Shares of the Company in connection with the Fundamental Transaction, whether that consideration be in the form of
cash, shares or any combination thereof, or whether the holders of Ordinary Shares are given the choice to receive from among alternative
forms of consideration in connection with the Fundamental Transaction;
provided
,
further
, that if holders of Ordinary Shares
of the Company are not offered or paid any consideration in such Fundamental Transaction, such holders of Ordinary Shares will be deemed
to have received shares of the Successor Entity (which Successor Entity may be the Company following such Fundamental Transaction) in
such Fundamental Transaction. “
Black Scholes Value
” means the value of this Warrant based on the Black-Scholes Option
Pricing Model obtained from the “OV” function on Bloomberg determined as of the day of consummation of the applicable Fundamental
Transaction for pricing purposes and reflecting (A) a risk-free interest rate corresponding to the U.S. Treasury rate for a period equal
to the time between the date of the public announcement of the applicable contemplated Fundamental Transaction and the Termination Date,
(B) an expected volatility equal to 100 day volatility obtained from the HVT function on Bloomberg (determined utilizing a 365-day annualization
factor) as of the Trading Day immediately following the public announcement of the applicable Fundamental Transaction, (C) the underlying
price per share used in such calculation shall be the sum of the price per share being offered in cash, if any, plus the value of any
non-cash consideration, if any, being offered in such Fundamental Transaction, (D) a remaining option time equal to the time between the
date of the public announcement of the applicable contemplated Fundamental Transaction and the Termination Date and (E) a zero cost of
borrow. The payment of the Black Scholes Value will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds (or such other consideration)
within the later of (i) five Business Days of the Holder’s election and (ii) the date of consummation of the Fundamental Transaction.
The Company shall cause any successor entity in a Fundamental Transaction in which the Company is not the survivor (the “
Successor
Entity
”) to assume in writing all of the obligations of the Company under this Warrant in accordance with the provisions of
this Section 3(d) pursuant to written agreements in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Holder and approved by the Holder
(without unreasonable delay) prior to such Fundamental Transaction and shall, at the option of the Holder, deliver to the Holder in exchange
for this Warrant a security of the Successor Entity evidenced by a written instrument substantially similar in form and substance to this
Warrant which is exercisable for a corresponding number of share capital of such Successor Entity (or its parent entity) equivalent to
the Ordinary Shares acquirable and receivable upon exercise of this Warrant (without regard to any limitations on the exercise of this
Warrant) prior to such Fundamental Transaction, and with an exercise price which applies the exercise price hereunder to such share capital
(but taking into account the relative value of the Ordinary Shares pursuant to such Fundamental Transaction and the value of such share
capital, such number of share capital and such exercise price being for the purpose of protecting the economic value of this Warrant immediately
prior to the consummation of such Fundamental Transaction), and which is reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Holder.
Upon the occurrence of any such Fundamental Transaction, the Successor Entity shall be added to the term “Company” under this
Warrant (so that from and after the occurrence or consummation of such Fundamental Transaction, each and every provision of this Warrant
and the other Transaction Documents referring to the “Company” shall refer instead to each of the Company and the Successor
Entity or Successor Entities, jointly and severally), and the Successor Entity or Successor Entities, jointly and severally with the Company,
may exercise every right and power of the Company prior thereto and the Successor Entity or Successor Entities shall assume all of the
obligations of the Company prior thereto under this Warrant and the other Transaction Documents with the same effect as if the Company
and such Successor Entity or Successor Entities, jointly and severally, had been named as the Company herein. For the avoidance of doubt,
the Holder shall be entitled to the benefits of the provisions of this Section 3(d) regardless of (i) whether the Company has sufficient
authority to allot Ordinary Shares for the issuance of Warrant Ordinary Shares and/or (ii) whether a Fundamental Transaction occurs prior
to the Initial Exercise Date.
8
e)
Calculations
.
All calculations under this Section 3 shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100th of a share, as the case may be. For purposes
of this Section 3, the number of Ordinary Shares deemed to be issued and outstanding as of a given date shall be the sum of the number
of Ordinary Shares (excluding treasury shares, if any) issued and outstanding.
f)
Notice to
Holder
.
i.
Adjustment to
Exercise Price
. Whenever the Exercise Price is adjusted pursuant to any provision of this Section 3, the Company shall promptly deliver
to the Holder by email a notice setting forth the Exercise Price after such adjustment and any resulting adjustment to the number of Warrant
Depositary Shares and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment.
ii.
Notice to Allow
Exercise by Holder

stock dividend or change in Ordinary Shares per Depositary Share ratio) on the Ordinary Shares, (B) the Company shall declare a special
nonrecurring cash dividend on or a redemption of the Ordinary Shares (excluding any granting or issuance of rights to all of the Company’s
shareholders pursuant to a shareholder rights plan), (C) the Company shall authorize the granting to all holders of the Ordinary Shares
rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any shares of capital stock of any class or of any rights, (D) the approval of any shareholders
of the Company shall be required in connection with any reclassification of the Ordinary Shares, any consolidation or merger to which
the Company (or any of its Subsidiaries) is a party, any sale or transfer of all or substantially all of its assets, or any compulsory
share exchange whereby the Ordinary Shares are converted into other securities, cash or property, or (E) the Company shall authorize the
voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company, then, in each case, the Company shall cause
to be delivered by email to the Holder at its last email address as it shall appear upon the Warrant Register of the Company, at least
10 calendar days prior to the applicable record or effective date hereinafter specified, a notice stating (x) the date on which a record
is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution, redemption, rights or warrants, or if a record is not to be taken, the
date as of which the holders of the Ordinary Shares of record to be entitled to such dividend, distributions, redemption, rights or warrants
are to be determined or (y) the date on which such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share exchange is expected
to become effective or close, and the date as of which it is expected that holders of the Ordinary Shares of record shall be entitled
to exchange their Ordinary Shares or Depositary Shares for securities, cash or other property deliverable upon such reclassification,
consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share exchange; provided that the failure to deliver such notice or any defect therein or in
the delivery thereof shall not affect the validity of the corporate action required to be specified in such notice and provided further
that no notice shall be required if the information is disseminated in a press release or document filed or furnished with the Commission.
To the extent that any notice provided in this Warrant constitutes, or contains, material, non-public information regarding the Company
or any of the Subsidiaries, the Company shall simultaneously file such notice with the Commission pursuant to a Report on Form 6-K. The
Holder shall remain entitled to exercise this Warrant during the period commencing on the date of such notice to the effective date of
the event triggering such notice except as may otherwise be expressly set forth herein.

this Warrant reduce the then current Exercise Price to any amount and for any period of time deemed appropriate by the board of directors
of the Company.
9
h)
Warrant Depositary
Shares Reset Process
. On each Reset Date, the Exercise Price shall be equal to (or adjusted to be equal to) the lower of (i) the Exercise
Price then in effect and (ii) the applicable Reset Price. Upon such reset of the Exercise Price pursuant to this Section 3(h), the number
of Warrant Depositary Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be increased such that the aggregate Exercise Price payable
hereunder, after taking into account the decrease in the Exercise Price, shall be equal to the aggregate Exercise Price on the Initial
Exercise Date (adjusted for any Warrants exercised or sold by the Holder prior to such Reset Date) for the Warrant Depositary Shares then
outstanding.
i)
Floor Price
.
In no event, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding, shall the Exercise Price be adjusted to a price that is less than the Floor

such notice. All Warrants issued on transfers or exchanges shall be dated the initial issuance date of this Warrant and shall be identical
with this Warrant except as to the number of Warrant Depositary Shares issuable pursuant thereto.
c)
Warrant Register
.
The Company shall register this Warrant, upon records to be maintained by the Company for that purpose (the “
Warrant Register
”),
in the name of the record Holder hereof from time to time. The Company may deem and treat the registered Holder of this Warrant as the

notice to the contrary.

. This Warrant does not entitle the Holder to any voting rights, dividends or
other rights as a shareholder of the Company prior to the exercise hereof as set forth in Section 2(d)(i), except as expressly set forth
in Section 3. Without limiting any rights of a Holder to receive Warrant Depositary Shares on a “cashless exercise” pursuant
to Section 2(c) or to receive cash payments pursuant to Section 2(d)(i) and Section 2(d)(iv) herein, in no event shall the Company be
required to net cash settle an exercise of this Warrant.
10
c)
Loss, Theft,
Destruction or Mutilation of Warrant
. The Company covenants that upon receipt by the Company of evidence reasonably satisfactory to
it of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Warrant or any share certificate relating to the Warrant Depositary Shares, and
in case of loss, theft or destruction, of indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to it (which, in the case of the Warrant, shall
not include the posting of any bond), and upon surrender and cancellation of such Warrant or share certificate, if mutilated, the Company
will make and deliver a new Warrant or share certificate of like tenor and dated as of such cancellation, in lieu of such Warrant or share
certificate.
d)
Saturdays,
Sundays, Holidays, etc
. If the last or appointed day for the taking of any action or the expiration of any right required or granted
herein shall not be a Trading Day, then such action may be taken or such right may be exercised on the next succeeding Trading Day.
e)
Authorized
Shares
. The Company covenants that, during the period the Warrant is outstanding, its directors will have authority to allot a sufficient
number of shares to provide for the issuance of the Warrant Depositary Shares and the underlying Ordinary Shares upon the exercise of
any purchase rights under this Warrant. The Company further covenants that its issuance of this Warrant shall constitute full authority
to its officers who are charged with the duty of issuing the necessary Warrant Depositary Shares upon the exercise of the purchase rights
under this Warrant. The Company will take all such reasonable action as may be necessary to assure that such Ordinary Shares and Depositary
Shares may be issued as provided herein without violation of any applicable law or regulation, or of any requirements of the Trading Market
upon which the Depositary Shares may be listed. The Company covenants that all Warrant Ordinary Shares underlying the Warrant Depositary
Shares which may be issued upon the exercise of the purchase rights represented by this Warrant will, upon exercise of the purchase rights
represented by this Warrant and payment for such Warrant Depositary Shares in accordance herewith, be duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable and free from all taxes, liens and charges created by the Company in respect of the issue thereof (other
than taxes in respect of any transfer occurring contemporaneously with such issue).
Except and to the
extent as waived or consented to by the Holder, the Company shall not by any action, including, without limitation, amending its articles
of association or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any
other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of this Warrant, but will at all times
in good faith assist in the carrying out of all such terms and in the taking of all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to
protect the rights of Holder as set forth in this Warrant against impairment. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company
will (i) not increase the nominal value of any Ordinary Shares above the amount payable therefor upon such exercise immediately prior
to such increase in nominal value, (ii) take all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order that the Company may validly
and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable Warrant Ordinary Shares underlying the Warrant Depositary Shares upon the exercise of this
Warrant and (iii) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all such authorizations, exemptions or consents from any public regulatory
body having jurisdiction thereof, as may be, necessary to enable the Company to perform its obligations under this Warrant.
Before taking any
action which would result in an adjustment in the number of Warrant Depositary Shares for which this Warrant is exercisable or in the
Exercise Price, the Company shall obtain all such authorizations or exemptions thereof, or consents thereto, as may be necessary from
any public regulatory body or bodies having jurisdiction thereof.
f)
Governing
Law
. All questions concerning the construction, validity, enforcement and interpretation of this Warrant shall be determined in accordance
with the provisions of the Purchase Agreement, and any action relating to this Warrant shall only be brought as provided in the Purchase
Agreement.
g)
Restrictions
.
The Holder acknowledges that the Warrant Depositary Shares acquired upon the exercise of this Warrant, if not registered, will have restrictions
upon resale imposed by state, federal, or foreign securities laws.
11
h)
Nonwaiver
and Expenses
. No course of dealing or any delay or failure to exercise any right hereunder on the part of Holder shall operate as
a waiver of such right or otherwise prejudice the Holder’s rights, powers or remedies, notwithstanding the fact that the right to
exercise this Warrant terminates on the Termination Date. Without limiting any other provision of this Warrant, if it is finally adjudicated
(without the possibility of appeal) that the Company has willfully and knowingly failed to comply with any provision of this Warrant,
which has resulted in any material damages to the Holder, the Company shall pay to the Holder such amounts as shall be sufficient to cover
any costs and expenses including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees, including those of appellate proceedings, incurred
by the Holder in collecting any amounts due pursuant hereto or in otherwise enforcing any of its rights, powers or remedies hereunder.
i)
Notices
.
Any and all notices or other communications or deliveries to be provided by the Holders hereunder including, without limitation, any Notice
of Exercise, shall be in writing and delivered personally, by e-mail, or sent by a nationally recognized overnight courier service, addressed
to the Company, at 1 Caspian Point, Caspian Way, Cardiff, CF10 4DQ, United Kingdom, Attention: Chief Executive Officer, email address:
stephen.stamp@biodexapharma.com, or such other email address or address as the Company may specify for such purposes by notice to the
Holders. Any and all notices or other communications or deliveries to be provided by the Company hereunder shall be delivered in accordance
with the notice provisions of the Purchase Agreement.
j)
Limitation
of Liability
. No provision hereof, in the absence of any affirmative action by the Holder to exercise this Warrant to purchase Warrant
Depositary Shares, and no enumeration herein of the rights or privileges of the Holder, shall give rise to any liability of the Holder
for the purchase price of any Depositary Shares or as a shareholder of the Company, whether such liability is asserted by the Company
or by creditors of the Company.
k)
Remedies
.
The Holder, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights granted by law, including recovery of damages, will be entitled to specific
performance of its rights under this Warrant. The Company agrees that monetary damages would not be adequate compensation for any loss
incurred by reason of a breach by it of the provisions of this Warrant and hereby agrees to waive and not to assert the defense in any
action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate.
l)
Successors
and Assigns
. Subject to applicable securities laws, this Warrant and the rights and obligations evidenced hereby shall inure to the
benefit of and be binding upon the successors and permitted assigns of the Company and the successors and permitted assigns of Holder.
The provisions of this Warrant are intended to be for the benefit of any Holder from time to time of this Warrant and shall be enforceable
by the Holder or holder of Warrant Depositary Shares.
m)
Amendment
.
This Warrant may be modified or amended or the provisions hereof waived with the written consent of the Company, on the one hand, and
the Holder or the beneficial owner of this Warrant, on the other hand.
n)
Severability
.
Wherever possible, each provision of this Warrant shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law,
but if any provision of this Warrant shall be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective to the
extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provisions or the remaining provisions of this Warrant.
o)
Headings
.
The headings used in this Warrant are for the convenience of reference only and shall not, for any purpose, be deemed a part of this Warrant.
