provided
that
no such action shall be effective hereunder unless taken on or prior to the applicable Expiration Date by Holders of the requisite principal
amount of Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to prevent the Issuer
from setting a new record date for any action for which a record date has previously been set pursuant to this paragraph (whereupon the
record date previously set shall automatically and with no action by any Person be cancelled and of no effect), provided, however, nothing
in this paragraph shall be construed to render ineffective any action taken by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding
Securities on the date such action is taken based on such record date previously set. Promptly after any record date is set pursuant to
this paragraph, the Issuer, at its own expense, shall cause notice of such record date, the proposed action by Holders and the applicable
Expiration Date to be given to the Trustee in writing and to each Holder of Securities in the manner set forth in Section 106.
The Trustee may set any day as a record date for
the purpose of determining the Holders of Outstanding Securities of any series entitled to join in the giving or making of (i) any

date, and no other Holders, shall be entitled to join in such notice, declaration, request or direction, whether or not such Holders remain
Holders after such record date;
provided
that no such action shall be effective hereunder unless taken on or prior to the applicable
Expiration Date by Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of such series on such record date. Nothing in
this paragraph shall be construed to prevent the Trustee from setting a new record date for any action for which a record date has previously
been set pursuant to this paragraph (whereupon the record date previously set shall automatically and with no action by any Person be
cancelled and of no effect), provided, however, nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to render ineffective any action taken by
Holders of the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities of the relevant series on the date such action is taken based on such
record date previously set. Promptly after any record date is set pursuant to this paragraph, the Trustee, at the Issuer’s expense,
shall cause notice of such record date, the proposed action by Holders and the applicable Expiration Date to be given to the Issuer in
writing and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series in the manner set forth in Section 106.
With respect to any record date set pursuant to this
Section, the party hereto that sets such record date may designate any day as the “Expiration Date” and from time to time
may change the Expiration Date to any earlier or later day;
provided
that no such change shall be effective unless notice of the
proposed new Expiration Date is given to the other parties hereto in writing, and to each Holder of Securities of the relevant series
in the manner set forth in Section 106, on or prior to the existing Expiration Date. If an Expiration Date is not designated with
respect to any record date set pursuant to this Section, the party hereto that sets such record date shall be deemed to have initially
designated the 180th day after such record date as the Expiration Date with respect thereto, subject to its right to change the Expiration
Date as provided in this paragraph. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no Expiration Date shall be later than the 180th day after the applicable
record date.

hereunder to take any action hereunder with regard to any particular Security may do so with regard to all or any part of the principal
amount of such Security or by one or more duly appointed agents each of which may do so pursuant to such appointment with regard to all
or any part of such principal amount of such Security.

postage prepaid, made available or delivered by electronic mail to each Holder affected by such event, at his address as it appears in

other Holders. Where this Indenture provides for notice in any manner, such notice may be waived in writing by the Person entitled to
receive such notice, either before or after the event, and such waiver shall be the equivalent of such notice. Waivers of notice by Holders
shall be filed with the Trustee, but such filing shall not be a condition precedent to the validity of any action taken in reliance upon
such waiver.
In case by reason of the suspension of regular mail
service or by reason of any other cause it shall be impracticable to give such notice by mail, then such notification as shall be made
with the approval of the Trustee shall constitute a sufficient notification for every purpose hereunder.

Section 203
Form of
Reverse of Security
.
This Security is one of a duly authorized issue
of securities of the Issuer (the “Securities”), issued and to be issued in one or more series under an Indenture, dated as
of November 17, 2025 (the “Indenture”), among the Issuer, the Guarantors party thereto and U.S. Bank Trust Company,
National Association, as Trustee, and reference is hereby made to the Indenture for a statement of the respective rights, limitations
of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms
upon which the Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered.
This Security is one of the series designated on
the face hereof [
if applicable, insert
—, limited in aggregate principal amount to €..........] [
if applicable,
insert
—;
provided
, however, that the Issuer may from time to time or at any time, without the consent of the Holders
of the Securities, create and issue additional Securities with terms and conditions identical to those of the Securities (except for
the issue date, the issue price and the first interest payment date), which additional Securities shall increase the aggregate principal
amount of, and shall be consolidated and form a single series with, the Securities; provided that if such additional Securities are not
fungible with the Securities for U.S. federal income tax purposes, such additional Securities will have a different CUSIP number from
the Securities].
This Security is an unsecured obligation of the
Issuer and ranks in right of payment on parity with all other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Issuer (and without any
preference among themselves) and the Guarantees are unsecured obligations of the Guarantors and will rank on a parity with all other
unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness of the Guarantors, except, in each case, for indebtedness mandatorily preferred by law.

month[s] prior to their maturity date) (the “Par Call Date”), the Issuer may redeem the Securities at its option, in whole
or in part, at any time and from time to time, at a redemption price (expressed as a percentage of principal amount and rounded to three
decimal places) equal to the greater of:
(1) (a) the sum of the present values of the remaining
scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon discounted to the redemption date (assuming the Securities matured on the Par Call
Date) on a semi-annual basis (assuming a 360-day year consisting of twelve 30-day months) at the Treasury Rate plus basis points less
(b) interest accrued to the date of redemption, and
(2) 100% of the principal amount of the Securities
to be redeemed,
plus, in either case, accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the redemption
date. On or after the Par Call Date, the Issuer may redeem the Securities, in whole or in part, at any time and from time to time, at
a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Securities being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon to
the redemption date.
“Treasury Rate” means, with respect
to any redemption date, the yield determined by the Issuer in accordance with the following two paragraphs.
The Treasury Rate shall be determined by the Issuer
after 4:15 p.m., New York City time (or after such time as yields on U.S. government securities are posted daily by the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System), on the third Business Day preceding the redemption date based upon the yield or yields for the most recent
day that appear after such time on such day in the most recent statistical release published by the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System designated as “Selected Interest Rates (Daily) – H.15” (or any successor designation or publication)
(“H.15”) under the caption “U.S. government securities – Treasury constant maturities – Nominal”
(or any successor caption or heading) (“H.15 TCM”). In determining the Treasury Rate, the Issuer shall select, as applicable:
(1) the yield for the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 exactly equal to the period from the redemption date to the Par Call Date
(the “Remaining Life”); or (2) if there is no such Treasury constant maturity on H.15 exactly equal to the Remaining
Life, the two yields – one yield corresponding to the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 immediately shorter than and one yield
corresponding to the Treasury constant maturity on H.15 immediately longer than the Remaining Life – and shall interpolate to the
Par Call Date on a straight line basis (using the actual number of days) using such yields and rounding the result to three decimal places;
or (3) if there is no such Treasury constant maturity on H.15 shorter than or longer than the Remaining Life, the yield for the
single Treasury constant maturity on H.15 closest to the Remaining Life. For purposes of this paragraph, the applicable Treasury constant
maturity or maturities on H.15 shall be deemed to have a maturity date equal to the relevant number of months or years, as applicable,
of such Treasury constant maturity from the redemption date.
21
If on the third Business Day preceding the redemption
date H.15 TCM is no longer published, the Issuer shall calculate the Treasury Rate based on the rate per annum equal to the semi-annual
equivalent yield to maturity at 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the second Business Day preceding such redemption date of the U.S.
Treasury security maturing on, or with a maturity that is closest to, the Par Call Date, as applicable. If there is no U.S. Treasury
security maturing on the Par Call Date but there are two or more U.S. Treasury securities with a maturity date equally distant from the
Par Call Date, one with a maturity date preceding the Par Call Date and one with a maturity date following the Par Call Date, the Issuer
shall select the U.S. Treasury security with a maturity date preceding the Par Call Date. If there are two or more U.S. Treasury securities
maturing on the Par Call Date or two or more U.S. Treasury securities meeting the criteria of the preceding sentence, the Issuer shall
select from among these two or more U.S. Treasury securities the U.S. Treasury security that is trading closest to par based upon the
average of the bid and asked prices for such U.S. Treasury securities at 11:00 a.m., New York City time. In determining the Treasury
Rate in accordance with the terms of this paragraph, the semi-annual yield to maturity of the applicable U.S. Treasury security shall
be based upon the average of the bid and asked prices (expressed as a percentage of principal amount) at 11:00 a.m., New York City time,
of such U.S. Treasury security, and rounded to three decimal places.
The Issuer’s actions and determinations in
determining the redemption price shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error. Neither the Trustee nor any
agent shall be responsible for determining, verifying or calculating amounts payable under a notice of redemption, the redemption price
or any premium and/or any adjustments to them (including, any accrued and unpaid interest, if any) and the Trustee and the agents will
not be responsible to the holders or any other person for any loss or liability arising from any failure by them to do so.
Notice of any redemption will be mailed or electronically
delivered (or otherwise transmitted in accordance with the depositary’s procedures) at least 10 days but not more than 60 days
before the redemption date to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed. Any redemption or notice of any redemption may, at the Issuer's
discretion, be subject to one or more conditions precedent, including, but not limited to, completion of an equity offering, other offering,
issuance of indebtedness or other transaction or event. In the case of a partial redemption, selection of the Securities for redemption
will be made pro rata, by lot or by such other method as the Trustee in its sole discretion deems appropriate and fair. No Securities
of a principal amount of €2,000 or less will be redeemed in part. If any Security is to be redeemed in part only, the notice of
redemption that relates to the Security will state the portion of the principal amount of the Security to be redeemed. A new Security
in a principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the Security will be issued in the name of the Holder of the Security upon surrender
for cancellation of the original Security. For so long as the Securities are held by The Depository Trust Company (or another depositary),
the redemption of the Securities shall be done in accordance with the policies and procedures of the depositary.
Unless the Issuer defaults in payment of the redemption
price, on and after the redemption date interest will cease to accrue on the Securities or portions thereof called for redemption.]
[if applicable, insert — On or after , the
Securities are subject to redemption at the option of the Issuer on any date (a “Par Call Date”), in whole or from time to
time in part, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Securities being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest
to such redemption date, all as provided in the Indenture. Notwithstanding the foregoing, installments of interest on Securities that
are due and payable on Interest Payment Dates falling on or prior to a Par Call Date will be payable on the Interest Payment Date in
accordance with their terms and in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture.]
[
insert any other redemption provisions applicable
to the Securities
]
In addition to its ability to redeem this Security
pursuant to the foregoing, this Security may be redeemed by the Issuer on the terms set forth, and as more fully described, in Section 1108
of the Indenture, in certain circumstances where the Issuer would be required to pay Additional Amounts due to certain changes in the
tax treatment of this Security or the Guarantees.
22
In the event of redemption of this Security in part
only, a new Security or Securities of this series and of like tenor for the unredeemed portion hereof will be issued in the name of the
Holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.
Upon the occurrence of any Change of Control Triggering
Event and upon the terms and conditions set forth in Section 1009 of the Indenture, each Holder has the right to require the Issuer
to purchase all or a portion of the Securities of such Holder properly tendered at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount
thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest (if any) to the date of purchase (subject to the right of holders of record on the relevant
record date to receive interest due on the relevant Interest Payment Date).
The Indenture contains provisions for defeasance
at any time of the entire indebtedness of the series of which this Security is a part or certain restrictive covenants and Events of
Default with respect to this Security, in each case upon compliance with certain conditions set forth in the Indenture.
If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing,
the principal of the Securities may be declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture.
In any case where the due date for the payment of
the Principal Amount of, or any premium or interest with respect to any Security or the date fixed for redemption or repurchase of any
Security shall not be a Business Day at a Place of Payment, then payment of the Principal Amount, premium, if any, or interest, including
any Additional Amounts payable in respect thereto need not be made on such date at such Place of Payment but may be made on the next
succeeding Business Day at such Place of Payment, with the same force and effect as if made on the date for such payment or the date
fixed for redemption or repurchase, and no interest shall accrue for the period after such date.
The Indenture permits, with certain exceptions as
therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors and the rights
of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be affected under the Indenture at any time by the Issuer, the Guarantors, and the
Trustee with the consent of the Holders of a majority in Principal Amount of the Securities at the time Outstanding of each series to
be affected. The Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in Principal Amount of the Securities
of each series at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all Securities of such series, to waive compliance by the Issuer,
the Guarantors, or any of them, with certain provisions of the Indenture and certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences.
Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders
of this Security and of any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu hereof, whether
or not notation of such consent or waiver is made upon this Security.
The Guarantors that are a party to the Indenture
as at, or subsequent to, the date of authentication of this Security (including any New Guarantors in accordance with Section 1010
of the Indenture and subject to release of any Subsidiary Guarantor(s) in accordance with Section 1302 of the Indenture), have
fully, unconditionally and irrevocably guaranteed, on a joint and several basis, pursuant to the terms of the Guarantees contained in
Article Thirteen of the Indenture, the due and punctual payment of the principal of and any premium and interest on this Security,
any Additional Amounts payable in respect thereof and any other amounts payable by the Issuer under the Indenture, when and as the same
shall become due and payable, whether at the Stated Maturity, by declaration of acceleration, call for redemption or otherwise, in accordance
with the terms of this Security and the Indenture. The obligations of the Guarantors to the Holder of this Security and to the Trustee
pursuant to the Guarantees and the Indenture are expressly set forth in Article Thirteen of the Indenture and reference is made
to such Article and Indenture for the precise terms of the Guarantees.
Within 30 days of any Subsidiary of the Parent Guarantor
becoming a Relevant Guarantor, the Parent Guarantor shall cause such Relevant Guarantor to also become a Guarantor (each, a “New
Guarantor”) of all amounts due and owing on the Outstanding Securities by having such New Guarantor, the Issuer and the Trustee
deliver a New Guarantor Supplemental Indenture within such 30 day period,
provided
that such New Guarantor’s Guarantee may
contain any limitation required under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is incorporated or organized, or which are substantially
similar to the limitations contained in such other new guarantees given by the New Guarantor in relation to the Specified Indebtedness
giving rise to its status as a Relevant Guarantor.
23
Upon execution and delivery by the New Guarantor
of its New Guarantor Supplemental Indenture and any other documents provided for in Section 1010, the New Guarantor shall be a Guarantor
for the purposes of this Indenture and for purposes of all amounts due and owing on the Outstanding Securities. In connection therewith,
(i) the rights and obligations of such New Guarantor and the restrictions imposed upon it under this Indenture shall be the same
in all respects as if the New Guarantor had been an Original Guarantor and (ii) the rights and obligations and restrictions imposed
upon the other Guarantors shall be the same in all respects as if the New Guarantor had been an Original Guarantor.
In accordance with Section 1302 of the Indenture,
any or all of the Subsidiary Guarantors may be released at any time from their respective Guarantees and other obligations under the
Indenture and the Securities without the consent of any Holder. Such release will occur upon or concurrently with the Subsidiary Guarantor
no longer being a Relevant Guarantor and upon the delivery of an Officer’s Certificate of Release to the Trustee certifying that
the Subsidiary Guarantor is no longer a Relevant Guarantor,
provided
that, at the time of such release, no default or Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing.
As provided in and subject to the provisions of
the Indenture, the Holder of this Security shall not have the right to institute any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect
to the Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee or for any other remedy thereunder, unless such Holder shall have previously
given the Trustee written notice of a continuing Event of Default with respect to the Securities of this series, the Holders of not less
than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of this series at the time Outstanding shall have made written request to the
Trustee to institute proceedings in respect of such Event of Default as Trustee and offered the Trustee indemnity satisfactory to it,
and the Trustee shall not have received from the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series at
the time Outstanding a direction inconsistent with such request, and the Trustee shall have failed to institute any such proceeding,
for 60 days after receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity. The foregoing shall not apply to any suit instituted by the
Holder of this Security for the enforcement of any payment of principal amount hereof or any premium or interest hereon on or after the
respective due dates expressed herein.
No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision
of this Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Issuer or the Guarantors, which is absolute and unconditional,
to pay the principal amount of and any premium and interest on this Security at the times, place and rate, and in the coin or currency,
herein prescribed.
As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain
limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in the Security Register, upon surrender of this Security
for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the Issuer in any place where the principal amount of and any premium and interest
on this Security are payable, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Issuer
and the Security Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more
new Securities of this series and of like tenor, of authorized denominations and for the same aggregate principal amount, will be issued
to the designated transferee or transferees.
The Securities of this series are issuable only
in fully registered form, without coupons, and in minimum denominations of €2,000 and any integral multiple of €1,000 in excess
thereof. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Securities of this series are exchangeable
for a like aggregate principal amount of Securities of this series and of like tenor of a different authorized denomination, as requested
by the Holder surrendering the same.
No service charge shall be made for any such registration
of transfer or exchange, but the Issuer may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable
in connection therewith.
24
Prior to due presentment of this Security for registration
of transfer, the Issuer, the Trustee and any agent of the Issuer, the Guarantors or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this
Security is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, whether or not this Security is overdue, and none of the Issuer, the Trustee
nor any such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.
This Security and the Guarantees shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the law of the State of New York, but without regard to the principles of conflicts of laws thereof
that would require the application of the laws of a jurisdiction other than the State of New York;
provided
, however, that all
matters governing the authorization and execution of the Securities by the Issuer shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the laws of England and Wales and the authorization and execution of any notation of the Guarantees by the Guarantors pursuant to Article Thirteen
of the Indenture or any Guarantees endorsed by such Guarantors on this Security, if any, shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the respective places of incorporation of each such Guarantor.
All terms used in this Security are defined in the
Indenture shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.

The Securities shall, subject in each case to compliance
with applicable laws, be issuable only in fully registered form, without coupons, in such denominations as shall be specified as contemplated
by Section 301. In the absence of any such specified denomination with respect to the Securities of any series, the Securities of
such series shall be issued only in minimum denominations of €2,000 and any integral multiple of €1,000 in excess thereof.
Section 303
Execution, Authentication, Delivery and Dating.
The Securities shall be executed on behalf of the
Issuer by any one or more Directors and Authorized Officers. The signature of any Director or Authorized Officer on the Securities may
be manual or electronic.
Securities bearing the manual or electronic signatures
of any individual who was at any time the proper Director or Authorized Officer of the Issuer shall bind the Issuer notwithstanding that
such individual has ceased to hold such office prior to the authentication and delivery of such Securities or did not hold such office
on the date of issuance of such Securities.
28
At any time and from time to time after the execution
and delivery of this Indenture, the Issuer may deliver Securities executed by the Issuer to the Trustee for authentication, together
with an Issuer Order for the authentication and delivery of such Securities, and the Trustee in accordance with the Issuer Order shall
authenticate and deliver such Securities. In authenticating such Securities, and accepting the additional responsibilities under this
Indenture in relation to such Securities, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, and (subject to Sections 601 and 603) shall be fully
protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating,
(1) that the forms (if the form
of such Securities has been established by or pursuant to Board Resolution as permitted by Section 201) and/or terms (if the terms
of such Securities have been established by or pursuant to Board Resolution as permitted by Section 301) of such Securities have
been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture;
(2) that such Securities, when
such Securities have been authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and issued by the Issuer in the manner and subject to any qualifications,
assumptions and limitations specified in such Opinion of Counsel, will constitute valid and binding obligations of the Issuer enforceable
in accordance with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of
general applicability relating to or affecting creditors’ rights and to general equity principles and to such other matters as
counsel shall specify therein;
(3) when such Securities have been
authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and issued by the Issuer in the manner and subject to any conditions specified in such Opinion
of Counsel, the Guarantees will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Guarantors, enforceable in accordance with their
terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws of general applicability relating
to or affecting creditors’ rights and to general equity principles and to such other matters as counsel shall specify therein;
and
(4) that all conditions precedent
to issuance and authentication of the Securities under this Indenture have been satisfied.
The Trustee shall not be required to authenticate
such Securities if the issue of any such series of Securities pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustee’s own rights,
duties or immunities under the Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner that is not reasonably acceptable to the Trustee
or if the Trustee, being advised by counsel, determines that such action may not be lawfully taken.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 301
and of the second preceding paragraph, if all Securities of a series are not to be originally issued at one time, it shall not be necessary
to deliver the Officer’s Certificate otherwise required pursuant to Section 301 or the Issuer Order and Opinion of Counsel
otherwise required pursuant to such second preceding paragraph at or prior to the authentication of each Security of such series if such
documents are delivered at or prior to the authentication upon original issuance of the first Security of such series to be issued and
reasonably contemplate the subsequent issuance of each Security of such series.
Each Security shall be dated on the date of its
authentication.
No Security shall be entitled to any benefit under
this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose unless there appears on such Security a certificate of authentication substantially
in the form provided for herein executed by the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent by electronic or manual signature, and such certificate
upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such Security has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Security shall have been authenticated and delivered hereunder but never issued and sold by the
Issuer, and the Issuer shall deliver such Security to the Paying Agent for cancellation as provided in Section 309, for all purposes
of this Indenture such Security shall be deemed never to have been authenticated and delivered hereunder and shall never be entitled
to the benefits of this Indenture.
Section 304
Temporary
Securities
.
Pending the preparation of definitive Securities
of any series, the Issuer may execute and, upon compliance with Section 303 by the Issuer, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver,
temporary Securities that shall be produced, in any authorized denomination, substantially of the tenor of the definitive Securities
in lieu of which they are issued and with such appropriate insertions, omissions, substitutions and other variations as the Directors
and/or Authorized Officers executing such Securities may determine, as evidenced by their execution of such Securities.
29
If temporary Securities of any series are issued,
the Issuer will cause definitive Securities of that series to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the preparation of definitive
Securities of such series, the temporary Securities of such series shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities of such series upon
surrender of the temporary Securities of such series at the office or agency of the Issuer in a Place of Payment for that series, without
charge to the Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary Securities of any series, the Issuer shall execute
and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor, one or more definitive Securities of the same series, of any authorized
denominations and of like tenor and aggregate principal amount. Until so exchanged, the temporary Securities of any series shall in all
respects be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series and tenor.
Section 305
Registration,
Registration of Transfer and Exchange
.
(a)
General
The Issuer shall cause to be kept at the Corporate
Trust Office of the Trustee a register (the register maintained in such office and in any other office or agency of the Issuer in a Place
of Payment being herein sometimes collectively referred to as the “Security Register”) in which, subject to such reasonable
regulations as it may prescribe and the transfer restrictions applicable to Securities herein provided, the Issuer shall provide for
the registration of Securities. The Security Register for any series of Securities may not be established or maintained at any time in
the United Kingdom. The Trustee is hereby appointed “Security Registrar” for the purpose of registering Securities and transfers
of such Securities as herein provided and the Trustee hereby accepts such appointment. There shall be only one Security Registrar for
each series of Securities.
Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any
Security of any series at the office or agency of the Issuer in a Place of Payment for that series, the Issuer shall execute and the
Trustee shall, subject to the transfer restrictions set forth herein and in such Security, authenticate and deliver, in the name of the
designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and of like tenor
and aggregate principal amount. No transfer of a Security to any Person shall be effective under this Indenture or the Securities unless
and until such Security has been registered in the name of such Person.
Subject to this Section 305, at the option
of the Holder, Securities of any series may be exchanged for other Securities of the same series, of any authorized denominations and
of like tenor and aggregate principal amount, upon surrender of the Securities to be exchanged at such office or agency. Whenever any
Securities are so surrendered for exchange, the Issuer shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, the Securities which
the Holder making the exchange is entitled to receive.
All Securities issued upon any registration of transfer
or exchange of Securities shall be the valid obligations of the Issuer evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under
this Indenture, as the Securities surrendered upon such registration of transfer or exchange.
Every Security presented or surrendered for registration
of transfer or for exchange shall (if so required by the Issuer or the Trustee) be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by a written instrument
of transfer in form satisfactory to the Issuer and the Security Registrar duly executed, by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized
in writing (with the signatures guaranteed in satisfactory form, if reasonably required by the Issuer or the Trustee).
No service charge shall be made for any registration
of transfer or exchange of Securities, but the Issuer may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental
charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration of transfer or exchange of Securities, other than exchanges pursuant to
Section 304, 905 or 1107 not involving any transfer.
If the Securities of any series (or of any series
and specified tenor) are to be redeemed in part, neither the Security Registrar nor the Issuer shall be required (A) to issue, register
the transfer of or exchange any Securities of that series (or of that series and specified tenor) during a period beginning at the opening
of business 15 days before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption of any such Securities selected for redemption under Section 1103
and ending at the close of business on the day of such mailing, or (B) to register the transfer of or exchange any Security so selected
for redemption in whole or in part, except the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in part.
30
Each Holder and beneficial owner of Securities shall
be deemed to represent and agree that such Holder or beneficial owner understands that the Issuer, each Guarantor, the Trustee and each
Paying Agent may require certification reasonably acceptable to it (A) as a condition to the payment of principal of, premium, if
any, and interest on any Security without, or at a reduced rate of, withholding or backup withholding tax, and (B) to enable the
Issuer, each Guarantor, the Trustee and each Paying Agent to determine their duties and liabilities with respect to any taxes or other
charges that they may be required to pay, deduct or withhold from payments in respect of such Securities or the Holder or beneficial
owner of such Securities under any present or future law, rule or regulation of the United States, any State thereof, the District
of Columbia, or any territories thereof, the Bailiwick of Jersey, or the United Kingdom, or any present or future law, rule or regulation
of any political subdivision thereof or taxing authority therein or to comply with any reporting or other requirements under any such
law, rule or regulation. Such certification may include, without limitation, U.S. federal income tax forms (such as IRS Form W-8BEN,
W-8IMY, W-9, or W-8ECI or any successors to such IRS forms). Each Holder or beneficial owner of Securities agrees to provide any certification
required pursuant to this paragraph and to update or replace such form or certification in accordance with its terms or its subsequent
amendments.
(b)
Global Securities
The provisions of this Section 305(b) shall
apply only to Global Securities.
Each Global Security authenticated under this Indenture
shall be registered in the name of the Depositary designated for such Global Security or a nominee thereof and delivered to such Depositary
or a nominee thereof or custodian therefor, and each such Global Security shall constitute a single Security for all purposes of this
Indenture.
Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture,
no Global Security may be exchanged in whole or in part for Securities registered, and no transfer of a Global Security in whole or in
part may be made or registered, in the name of any Person other than the Depositary for such Global Security or a nominee thereof unless
(A) such Depositary (i) has notified the Issuer that it is unwilling or unable to continue to act as Depositary for such Global
Security or (ii) has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act, if so required by applicable law or regulation,
and no successor Depositary for such Securities shall have been appointed within 90 days of such notification or of the Issuer becoming
aware of the Depositary’s ceasing to be so registered as the case may be, (B) the Issuer in its sole discretion shall have
notified the Depositary by Issuer Order that the Global Securities shall be exchanged for such Securities, (C) there shall have
occurred and be continuing an Event of Default with respect to the Securities and the beneficial owners of not less than 50% of the aggregate
unpaid principal amount evidenced by such Global Security advise the Trustee and the Depositary for such Global Security through its
participants in writing that the continuation of the book-entry system is no longer in the best interests of such beneficial owners of
the Securities or (D) there shall exist such circumstances, if any, in addition to or in lieu of the foregoing as have been specified
for this purpose as contemplated by Section 301.
Subject to the preceding paragraph, any exchange
of a Global Security for other Securities may be made in whole or in part, and all Securities issued in exchange for a Global Security
or any portion thereof shall be registered in such names as the Depositary for such Global Security shall direct.
Every Security authenticated and delivered upon
registration of transfer of, or in exchange for or in lieu of, a Global Security or any portion thereof, whether pursuant to this Section,
Section 304, 306, 905 or 1107 or otherwise, shall be authenticated and delivered in the form of and shall be, a Global Security,
unless such Security is registered in the name of a Person other than the Depositary for such Global Security or a nominee thereof.
Except for the exchange rights provided in the third
paragraph of this Section 305(b) above, owners of beneficial interests in a Global Security held on their behalf by a Depositary
shall not be entitled to receive physical delivery of Securities in definitive form, shall not be considered the Holders thereof for
any purpose under this Indenture and shall have no rights under this Indenture with respect to such Global Security, and such Depositary
or its nominee may be treated by the Issuer, the Trustee and any agent of any of them as the Holder and owner of such Global Security
for all purposes whatsoever. Neither the Trustee nor any of its agents shall have any responsibility or liability for the actions taken
or not taken by the Depositary. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Depositary for any Global Security may grant proxies and otherwise
authorize any person, including the beneficial owners of interests in such Global Security, to take any action which a Holder is entitled
to take under this Indenture with respect to such Global Security.
31
(c)
Other Transfers and Exchanges
In case of any transfer or exchange the procedures
and requirements for which are not addressed in detail in this Section 305, such transfer or exchange will be subject to such procedures
and requirements as may be reasonably prescribed by the Issuer and the Trustee from time to time and, in the case of a transfer or exchange
involving a Global Security, the Applicable Procedures.
Section 306
Mutilated,
Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities
.
If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the
Trustee, the Issuer shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor, a new Security of the same series
and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
If there shall be delivered to the Issuer and the
Trustee (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Security and (ii) such security or indemnity
as may be required by them to save each of them and any of their agents harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Issuer or the
Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a protected purchaser, the Issuer shall execute and the Trustee shall, upon Issuer order,
authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security of the same series and of like tenor
and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen
Security has become or is about to become due and payable, the Issuer in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such
Security.

Section, the Issuer may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in
relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.
Every new Security of any series issued pursuant
to this Section in exchange for any mutilated Security or in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security, shall (i) constitute
an original contractual obligation of the Issuer, whether or not the mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time
enforceable by anyone, (ii) be registered by the Issuer in the Security Registrar in the name of such Person and (iii) shall
be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of that series duly issued

and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed,
lost or stolen Securities.

provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be paid to the Person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities)
is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date for such interest.
32
Any interest on any Security of any series that
is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date (“Defaulted Interest”) shall forthwith
cease to be payable to the Holder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of having been such Holder, and such Defaulted Interest
may be paid by the Issuer or the Guarantor, at its election in each case, as provided in clause (1) or (2) below:
(1) The Issuer or the Guarantor
may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective
Predecessor Securities) are registered at the close of business on a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest,
which shall be fixed in the following manner. The Issuer shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed
to be paid on each Security of such series and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Issuer or the Guarantor shall
deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or
shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited
to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this clause (1) provided. Thereupon
the Trustee shall fix a Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall be not more than 15 days and not less
than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed payment and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the
proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify the Issuer of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the expense of the
Issuer, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be given to each
Holder of Securities of such series in the manner set forth in Section 106, not less than 10 days prior to such Special Record Date.
Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor having been so mailed, such Defaulted
Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Securities of such series (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered
at the close of business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable pursuant to the following clause (2).
(2) The Issuer or the Guarantors
may make payment of any Defaulted Interest on the Securities of any series in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements
of any securities exchange on which such Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after
notice given by the Issuer to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this clause (2), such manner of payment shall be deemed
practicable by the Trustee.
Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section,
each Security delivered under this Indenture upon registration of transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of any other Security shall
carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, that were carried by such other Security.

If an Event of Default (other than an Event of Default
specified in Section 501(7)) with respect to Securities of any series at the time Outstanding occurs and is continuing, then, in
every such case, the Trustee (if a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has received written notice of such Event of Default) or the Holders
of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series may declare the principal amount of all
the Outstanding Securities of such series to be due and payable immediately, by a notice in writing to the Issuer with a copy to the
Parent Guarantor (and to the Trustee if given by Holders), and upon any such declaration such principal amount and any accrued interest
thereon shall become immediately due and payable. If an Event of Default specified in Section 501(7) occurs and is continuing,
then in every such case the principal of, Additional Amounts, if any, and any accrued and unpaid interest on the Outstanding Securities
of any series shall become immediately due and payable without any further action on the part of the Trustee or the Holders.

by the Trustee as hereinafter in this Article provided, the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding
Securities of such series, by written notice to the Issuer, the Guarantors and the Trustee, may rescind and annul such declaration and

the Trustee hereunder and the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel and
all amounts due to the Trustee under Section 607; and
(2) all Events of Default with
respect to the Securities of such series, other than the non-payment of the principal of or interest on the Securities of such series
that have become due solely by such declaration of acceleration, have been cured or waived as provided in Section 513.
No such rescission shall affect any subsequent default
or impair any right consequent thereon.
Section 503
Collection
of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by Trustee

The Issuer and each Guarantor covenants that if
(1) default is made in the payment
of any interest on any Security when such interest becomes due and payable and such default continues for a period of 30 days, or

of the principal of (or premium, if any, on) any Security at the Maturity thereof,
the Issuer and each Guarantor shall, upon demand of the Trustee, pay
to it, for the benefit of the Holders of such Securities, the whole amount then due and payable on such Securities for principal and
any premium and interest and, to the extent that payment of such interest shall be legally enforceable, interest on any overdue principal
and premium and on any overdue interest, at the rate or rates established as contemplated by Section 301 therefor, and, in addition
thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable compensation,
expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel and any other amounts due to the Trustee under Section 607.
If the Issuer and the Guarantors fail to pay such
amounts forthwith upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a judicial proceeding
for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, and may prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree, and may enforce the
same against the Issuer or the Guarantors or any other obligor upon such Securities or the Guarantees, as the case may be, and collect
the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law out of the property of the Issuer or the Guarantors or any
other obligor upon such Securities or the Guarantees, as the case may be, wherever situated.
If an Event of Default with respect to Securities
of any series occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of
the Holders of Securities of such series by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect
and enforce any such rights, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in aid of the exercise
of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper remedy.

proceeding. In particular, the Trustee shall be authorized to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or deliverable
on any such claims and to distribute the same; and any custodian, receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar
official in any such judicial proceeding is hereby authorized by each Holder to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that

compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under
Section 607.

adjustment or composition affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof or to authorize the Trustee to vote in respect
of the claim of any Holder in any such proceeding;

own name as trustee of an express trust, and any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of the reasonable compensation,
expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel and other amounts due to it under Section 607, be for
the ratable benefit of the Holders of the Securities in respect of which such judgment has been recovered.

of any Securities to exercise any right or remedy accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or constitute
a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence therein. Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to the

and surplus of such Person shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition
so published. If at any time the Trustee with respect to the Securities shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions
of this Section, it shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect hereinafter specified in this Article.
Section 610
Resignation
and Removal; Appointment of Successor
.
No resignation or removal of the Trustee and no
appointment of a successor Trustee pursuant to this Article shall become effective until the acceptance of appointment by the successor
Trustee in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 611.
The Trustee may be removed at any time with respect
to the Securities of any series by Act of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of
such series, upon 30 days’ prior written notice delivered to the Trustee and to the Issuer. If the instrument of acceptance by
a successor Trustee required by Section 611 shall not have been delivered to the Trustee within 30 days after the giving of such
notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may petition at the expense of the Issuer any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment
of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities.

with Section 608 after written request therefor by the Issuer or by any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for
at least six months;
45

with the provisions of Section 310(b) of the Trust Indenture Act (as if the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act applied to

(3) the Trustee shall become incapable
of acting or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent or a receiver of the Trustee or of its property shall be appointed or any public
officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or
liquidation, then, in any such case, (A) the Issuer may remove the Trustee with respect to all Securities, or (B) subject to
Section 514, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all
others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee with respect to all Securities
and the appointment of a successor Trustee.
The Trustee may resign at any time with respect
to the Securities by giving 30 days prior written notice thereof to the Issuer. If the instrument of acceptance by a successor Trustee
required by Section 611 shall not have been delivered to the Trustee within 30 days after the giving of such notice of resignation,
the resigning Trustee may petition at the expense of the Issuer and the Parent Guarantor any court of competent jurisdiction for the
appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities.
If the Trustee shall resign, be removed or become
incapable of acting, or if a vacancy shall occur in the office of Trustee for any cause, with respect to the Securities of one or more
series, the Issuer shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee or Trustees with respect to the Securities of that or those series (it
being understood that any such successor Trustee may be appointed with respect to the Securities of one or more of all of such series
and that at any time there shall be only one Trustee with respect to the Securities of any particular series) and shall comply with the
applicable requirements of Section 611. If, within one year after such resignation, removal or incapability, or the occurrence of
such vacancy, a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall be appointed by Act of the Holders of a majority
in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series delivered to the Issuer and the retiring Trustee, the successor Trustee
so appointed shall, forthwith upon its acceptance of such appointment in accordance with the applicable requirements of Section 611,
become the successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series and to that extent supersede the successor Trustee appointed
by the Issuer. If no successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series shall have been so appointed by the Issuer or the
Holders and accepted appointment in the manner required by Section 611, any Holder who has been a bona fide Holder of a Security
of such series for at least six months may, on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction
for the appointment of a successor Trustee with respect to the Securities of such series.
The Issuer shall give notice of each resignation
and each removal of the Trustee with respect to the Securities of any series and each appointment of a successor Trustee with respect
to the Securities of any series to all Holders of Securities of such series in the manner provided for in Section 106. Each notice
shall include the name of the successor Trustee with respect to the Securities and the address of its Corporate Trust Office.
In no event will the Trustee be responsible for
or have any liability for the acts or omissions of any such successor Trustee for the Securities of any series appointed hereunder or
for any separate or co-Trustee.
Section 611
Acceptance
of Appointment by Successor

In case of the appointment hereunder of a successor
Trustee with respect to all Securities, every such successor Trustee so appointed shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Issuer,
the Guarantors and to the retiring Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the
retiring Trustee shall become effective and such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested
with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee; but, on the request of the Issuer or the successor Trustee, such
retiring Trustee shall, upon payment of its charges, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor Trustee all the
rights, powers and trusts of the retiring Trustee and shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property
and money held by such retiring Trustee hereunder.

Trustee with respect to the Securities of one or more (but not all) series, the Issuer, the retiring Trustee and each successor Trustee
with respect to the Securities of one or more series shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental hereto wherein each successor
Trustee shall accept such appointment and which (1) shall contain such provisions as shall be necessary or desirable to transfer
and confirm to, and to vest in, each successor Trustee all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect
to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates, (2) if the retiring Trustee
is not retiring with respect to all Securities, shall contain such provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to confirm that
all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect to the Securities of that or those series as to which
the retiring Trustee is not retiring shall continue to be vested in the retiring Trustee, and (3) shall add to or change any of
the provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide for or facilitate the administration of the trusts hereunder by more
than one Trustee, it being understood that nothing herein or in such supplemental indenture shall constitute such Trustees co-trustees
of the same trust and that each such Trustee shall be trustee of a trust or trusts hereunder separate and apart from any trust or trusts
hereunder administered by any other such Trustee; and upon the execution and delivery of such supplemental indenture the resignation
or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective to the extent provided therein and each such successor Trustee, without any
further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee with respect
to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor Trustee relates; but, on request of the Issuer or
any successor Trustee, such retiring Trustee shall duly assign, transfer and deliver to such successor Trustee all property and money
held by such retiring Trustee hereunder with respect to the Securities of that or those series to which the appointment of such successor
Trustee relates.
Upon request of any such successor Trustee, the
Issuer and the Guarantors shall execute any and all instruments for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor
Trustee all such rights, powers and trusts referred to in the first preceding paragraph.

shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder,
provided
such corporation shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under this
Article, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto. In case any Securities
shall have been authenticated, but not delivered, by the Trustee then in office, any successor by merger, conversion or consolidation
to such authenticating Trustee may adopt such authentication and deliver the Securities so authenticated with the same effect as if such
successor Trustee had itself authenticated such Securities; and in case at that time any of the Securities shall not have been authenticated
by such predecessor Trustee, any successor Trustee may authenticate such Securities in its own name with the full force and effect which
this Indenture provides for the certificate of authentication of the Trustee.
Section 613

capacities as Authenticating Agent and Security Registrar and (ii) every provision of this Indenture relating to the conduct or
affecting the liability or offering protection, immunity or indemnity to the Trustee shall be deemed to apply with the same force and

appoint an Authenticating Agent or Agents with respect to one or more series of Securities that shall be authorized to act on behalf
of the Trustee to authenticate Securities of such series issued upon exchange, registration of transfer or partial redemption thereof
and Securities so authenticated shall be entitled to the benefits of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all purposes
as if authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. Wherever reference is made in this Indenture to the authentication and delivery of Securities
by the Trustee or the Trustee’s certificate of authentication, except upon original issue or pursuant to Section 306, such
reference shall be deemed to include authentication and delivery on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent and a certificate
of authentication executed on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent. Each Authenticating Agent shall be acceptable to the
Issuer and shall at all times be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States of America, any State
thereof or the District of Columbia, authorized under such laws to act as Authenticating Agent, having a combined capital and surplus
of not less than €50,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authority. If such Authenticating Agent
publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of said supervising or examining authority,
then for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and surplus of such Authenticating Agent shall be deemed to be its combined
capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time an Authenticating Agent shall cease
to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, such Authenticating Agent shall resign immediately in the manner and
with the effect specified in this Section.
Any corporation into which an Authenticating Agent
may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation
to which such Authenticating Agent shall be a party, or any corporation succeeding to the corporate agency or corporate trust business
of an Authenticating Agent, shall continue to be an Authenticating Agent,
provided
such corporation shall be otherwise eligible
under this Section, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the Trustee or the Authenticating
Agent.
An Authenticating Agent may resign at any time by
giving written notice thereof to the Trustee and to the Issuer. The Trustee may at any time terminate the agency of an Authenticating
Agent by giving written notice thereof to such Authenticating Agent and to the Issuer. Upon receiving such a notice of resignation or
upon such a termination, or in case at any time such Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions
of this Section, the Trustee may appoint a successor Authenticating Agent that shall be acceptable to the Issuer and shall give notice
of such appointment in the manner provided in Section 106 to all Holders of Securities of the series with respect to which such
Authenticating Agent will serve. Any successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its appointment hereunder shall become vested
with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named as an Authenticating Agent.
No successor Authenticating Agent shall be appointed unless eligible under the provisions of this Section.
The Issuer agrees to pay to each Authenticating
Agent from time to time reasonable compensation for its services under this Section.

if so requested by the Issuer in writing or by electronic means (which writing need not comply with Section 102 and need not be

the Trustee all sums held in trust by the Issuer or such Paying Agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the same trusts as those
upon which such sums were held by the Issuer or such Paying Agent; and, upon such payment by any Paying Agent to the Trustee, such Paying

by the Holder or beneficial owner of such Security or, in the case of a Global Security, the beneficial owner of such Global Security,
with a timely request of the Issuer, the Guarantors, the Trustee or any Paying Agent addressed to such Holder or beneficial owner, as

determined, the Issuer shall notify the Trustee of such amount promptly after such amount has been determined.

terms and (except as otherwise established as contemplated by Section 301 for the Securities of such series) in accordance with
this Section 1009. Upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event, unless the Issuer has previously exercised its right
to redeem the Securities in accordance with their respective terms, each Holder of Securities of such series will have the right to require
the Issuer to purchase all or a portion of such Holder’s Securities pursuant to the offer described below (the “Change of
Control Offer”), at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to

Interest Payment Date.
Within 30 days following the date upon which the
Change of Control Triggering Event occurred, or at the Issuer’s option, prior to any Change of Control, but after the public announcement
of the pending Change of Control, the Issuer shall send, by first class mail, a notice to each Holder of Securities of such series, with
a copy to the Trustee, which notice shall govern the terms of the Change of Control Offer. Such notice shall describe the transaction
or transactions that constitute the Change of Control and shall state:
(i) that the Change of Control Offer
is being made pursuant to this Section 1009 of this Indenture;
(ii) that the Issuer is required
to offer to purchase all of the outstanding principal amount of Securities, the purchase price and, that on the date specified in such
notice, which date shall be no earlier than 30 days and no later than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed, other than as may
be required by law (the “Change of Control Payment Date”), the Issuer shall repurchase the Securities validly tendered and
not withdrawn pursuant to this Section 1009;
(iii) if mailed prior to the date
of consummation of the Change of Control, shall state that the Change of Control Offer is conditioned on the Change of Control being
consummated on or prior to the Change of Control Payment Date;

or accepted for payment shall continue to accrue interest;
(v) that Securities accepted for
payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer shall cease to accrue interest after the Change of Control Payment Date;
(vi) that Holders electing to have
a Security purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer may elect to have all, or any portion of such Security, purchased;
(vii) that Holders of Securities
of such series electing to have Securities purchased pursuant to a Change of Control Offer shall be required to surrender their Securities,
with the form entitled “Option of Holder to Elect Purchase” on the reverse of the relevant Security, or such other customary
documents of surrender and transfer as the Issuer may reasonably request, duly completed, or transfer the relevant Security by book-entry
transfer, to the paying agent at the address specified in the notice prior to the Change of Control Payment Date;
(viii) that Holders whose Securities
are purchased only in part shall be issued new Securities equal in principal amount to the unpurchased portion of the Securities surrendered
(or transferred by book-entry transfer); and
62
(ix) the CUSIP number, if any, printed
on the Securities being repurchased and that no representation is made as to the correctness or accuracy of the CUSIP number, if any,
listed in such notice or printed on the Securities.
The Issuer shall not be required to make a Change
of Control Offer if a third party makes such an offer in the manner, at the times and otherwise in compliance with the requirements for
such an offer made by the Issuer and such third party purchases all corresponding Securities of such series properly tendered and not
withdrawn under its offer.
The Issuer shall comply with the requirements of
Rule 14e-1 under the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the extent such laws and regulations
are applicable in connection with the repurchase of Securities pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent that any securities
laws or regulations conflict with the provisions of this Section 1009, the Issuer shall comply with the applicable securities laws
and regulations and shall be deemed not to have breached its obligations under this Indenture by virtue thereof.
Section 1010
New Guarantors
.
The Parent Guarantor covenants and agrees that if
any Subsidiary of the Parent Guarantor that is not a Guarantor becomes a Relevant Guarantor, then within 30 days of such Subsidiary becoming
a Relevant Guarantor, the Parent Guarantor shall cause such Relevant Guarantor to also become a Subsidiary Guarantor (each, a “New
Guarantor”) of all amounts due and owing on the Outstanding Securities by having the New Guarantor, the Issuer and the Trustee
delivering a New Guarantor Supplemental Indenture within such 30 days,
provided
that such New Guarantor’s Guarantee may
contain any limitation required under the laws of the jurisdiction in which it is organized, or which are substantially similar to the
limitations contained in such other new guarantees given by the New Guarantor in relation to the Specified Indebtedness giving rise to
its status as a Relevant Guarantor.
Upon execution and delivery by the New Guarantor
of its New Guarantor Supplemental Indenture and any other documents provided for in this Section 1010, the New Guarantor shall be
a Guarantor for the purposes of this Indenture (and shall be deemed to be added to the list of Guarantors contained in Schedule 1 hereto)
and for purposes of all amounts due and owing on all Outstanding Securities. In connection therewith, (i) the rights and obligations
of such New Guarantor and the restrictions imposed upon it under this Indenture shall be the same in all respects as if the New Guarantor
had been an Original Guarantor and (ii) the rights and obligations and restrictions imposed upon the other Guarantors shall be the
same in all respects as if the New Guarantor had been an Original Guarantor.
Section 1011
Waiver of
Certain Covenants

by Section 301 for the Securities of any series, the Issuer may, with respect to the Securities, omit in any particular instance
to comply with any term, provision or condition set forth in any of Sections 1005, 1008 or 1009 (subject to Section 902(9)), if
before the time for such compliance the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of such series
shall, by Act of such Holders, either waive such compliance in such instance or generally waive compliance with such term, provision
or condition, but no such waiver shall extend to or affect such term, provision or condition except to the extent so expressly waived,
and, until such waiver shall become effective, the obligations of the Issuer and the Guarantors and the duties of the Trustee in respect
of any such term, provision or condition shall remain in full force and effect.
Section 1012
Stamp, Documentary
and Similar Taxes
.
The Issuer and the Guarantors jointly and severally
agree to pay all stamp, documentary or similar duties, taxes or fees which may be payable in respect of the execution and delivery or
the enforcement of this Indenture, any Guarantee or any Security and the execution and delivery (but not the transfer) or the enforcement
of any of the Securities or Guarantees in the United States or of any amendment of, supplement to, or waiver or consent under or with
respect to, this Indenture, any Guarantee or any Security save for any such duties, taxes or fees which arise or are increased as a result
of any document being voluntarily registered or submitted for stamping in any jurisdiction by the Trustee or any Holder, where the same
is not reasonably necessary for the purposes of enforcement, and to pay any value added, goods and services or similar tax due and payable
in respect of reimbursement of costs and expenses by the Issuer pursuant to this Section 1012 (save to the extent recoverable by
the Trustee or any Holder), and shall save the Trustee and each Holder to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law harmless against
any loss or liability resulting from nonpayment or delay in payment of such tax required to be paid by the Issuer and the Guarantors
hereunder;
provided
, however, that neither the Issuer nor any Guarantor shall be required to pay any such duty, tax or fee to
the extent such nonpayment or delay in payment results from any action or inaction of the Trustee.

only a single Security), the Issuer shall, at least 60 days prior to the Redemption Date fixed by the Issuer (unless a shorter notice
shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), notify the Trustee of such Redemption Date and of the principal amount of Securities of such series
to be redeemed and, if applicable, of the tenor of the Securities to be redeemed. In the case of any redemption of Securities prior to
the expiration of any restriction on such redemption provided in the terms of such Securities established as contemplated by Section 301,

Securities to be redeemed shall be selected not more than 60 days or less than 10 days prior to the Redemption Date, from the Outstanding
Securities of such series not previously called for redemption, either (i) in compliance with the requirement of the applicable
clearing systems, if the Securities are held through any clearing systems, or (ii) by the Trustee on a
pro rata
basis, by
lot or by such other method as the Trustee deems fair and appropriate, if the Securities are not held through any clearing systems, and
in either case which may provide for the selection for redemption of a portion of the principal amount of any Security of such series,
provided
that the unredeemed portion of the principal amount of any Security shall be in an authorized denomination (which shall
not be less than the minimum authorized denomination) for such Security.
The Trustee shall promptly notify the Issuer in
writing of the Securities selected for redemption as aforesaid and, in case of any Securities selected for partial redemption as aforesaid,
the principal amounts thereof to be redeemed.
The provisions of the two preceding paragraphs shall
not apply with respect to any redemption affecting only a single Security, whether such Security is to be redeemed in whole or in part.
In the case of any such redemption in part, the unredeemed portion of the principal amount of the Security shall be in an authorized
denomination (which shall not be less than the minimum authorized denomination) for such Security.

the Redemption Price (together with any accrued and unpaid interest payable on the Redemption Date) will become due and payable upon
each such Security to be redeemed and, if applicable, that interest thereon will cease to accrue on and after said date, and
(6) the place or places where such
Securities are to be surrendered for payment of the Redemption Price, and accrued interest, if any.
Notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed
at the election of the Issuer shall be given by the Issuer or, at the Issuer’s request, by the Trustee in the name and at the expense
of the Issuer.
Section 1105
Deposit
of Redemption Price
.
Not later than one Business Day prior to any Redemption
Date, the Issuer shall deposit with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent (or, if the Issuer is acting as its own Paying Agent, segregate
and hold in trust as provided in Section 1003) an amount of money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of, and (except if the
Redemption Date shall be an Interest Payment Date) accrued interest on, all the Securities which are to be redeemed on that date.
Section 1106
Securities
Payable on Redemption Date
.
Notice of redemption having been given as aforesaid,
the Securities so to be redeemed shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the Redemption Price applicable thereto, and

shall cease to bear interest. Upon surrender of any such Security for redemption in accordance with said notice, such Security shall
be paid by the Issuer at the Redemption Price, together with accrued interest to the Redemption Date;
provided
, however, that,
unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301, installments of interest whose Stated Maturity is on or prior to the
Redemption Date will be payable to the Holders of such Securities, or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such at the close
of business on the relevant Record Date according to their terms and the provisions of Section 307.
65
If any Security called for redemption shall not
be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the principal and any premium shall, until paid, bear interest from the Redemption
Date at the rate prescribed therefor in the terms of the Security established as contemplated by Section 301.
Section 1107
Securities
Redeemed in Part
.
Any Security which is to be redeemed only in part
shall be surrendered at a Place of Payment therefor (with, if the Issuer or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written
instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the Issuer and the Trustee duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized
in writing), and the Issuer shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the Holder of such Security without service
charge, a new Security or Securities of the same series and of like tenor, of any authorized denomination as requested by such Holder,
in aggregate principal amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of the Security so surrendered.
Section 1108
Optional
Redemption Due to Changes in Tax Treatment
.
Unless otherwise specified as contemplated by Section 301
with respect to any series of Securities, if, as the result of (a) any change in or any amendment to the laws, regulations or published
tax rulings of any Relevant Jurisdiction, or of any political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein, affecting taxation,
or (b) any change in the official administration, application or interpretation by a relevant court or tribunal, government or government
authority of any Relevant Jurisdiction of such laws, regulations or published tax rulings either generally or in relation to the Securities
or the Guarantees, which change or amendment is proposed and becomes effective on or after the later of (x) the original issue date
of such Securities or Guarantees or (y) the date on which a jurisdiction becomes a Relevant Jurisdiction (whether by consolidation,
merger or transfer of assets of the Issuer or any Guarantor, change in place of payment on the Securities or Guarantees or otherwise)
or which change in official administration, application or interpretation shall not have been available to the public prior to such original
issue date or the date on which such jurisdiction becomes a Relevant Jurisdiction (whichever is later), the Issuer or the Guarantors
would be required to pay any Additional Amounts pursuant to Section 1007 of this Indenture or the terms of any Guarantee in respect
of interest on the next succeeding Interest Payment Date (assuming, in the case of the Guarantors, a payment in respect of such interest
was required to be made by the Guarantors under the Guarantees thereof on such Interest Payment Date and the Guarantors would be unable,
for reasons outside their control, to procure payment by the Issuer), and the obligation to pay Additional Amounts cannot be avoided
by the use of commercially reasonable measures available to the Issuer or to the applicable Guarantor, as the case may be, the Issuer
may, at its option, redeem all (but not less than all) of the Securities in respect of which such Additional Amounts would be so payable
at any time, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ written notice as provided in Sections 1102 and 1104, at a Redemption
Price equal to 100% of the outstanding principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest due thereon up to, but not including,
the date fixed for redemption;
provided
, however, that:
(1) no such notice of redemption
may be given earlier than 60 days prior to the earliest date on which the Issuer or the applicable Guarantor would be obligated to pay
such Additional Amounts were a payment in respect of the Securities or the applicable Guarantee thereof then due, and
(2) at the time any such redemption
notice is given, such obligation to pay such Additional Amounts must remain in effect.
Prior to the publication or mailing of any notice
of any redemption of any Securities pursuant to this Section, the Issuer, the applicable Guarantor or any Person with whom the Issuer
or the applicable Guarantor has consolidated or merged, or to whom the Issuer or the applicable Guarantor has conveyed or transferred
or leased all or substantially all of its properties or assets (the successor Person in any such transaction, a “Successor Person”),
as the case may be, shall provide the Trustee with an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the conditions precedent to the right of
the Issuer to redeem such Securities pursuant to this Section have occurred and a certificate signed by a Director or an Authorized
Officer stating that the obligation to pay Additional Amounts with respect of such Securities cannot be avoided by taking measures that
the Issuer, the applicable Guarantor or the Successor Person, as determined by the Board of Directors of the Issuer or the Successor
Person, as the case may be, believes in good faith are commercially reasonable.

and to have satisfied all of its other obligations under the Securities of such series and this Indenture insofar as the Securities of
such series are concerned (and the Trustee, at the expense of the Issuer, shall execute proper instruments acknowledging the same), subject
to the following which shall survive until otherwise terminated or discharged hereunder: (1) the rights of Holders of the Outstanding
Securities of such series to receive, solely from the trust fund described in Section 1204 and as more fully set forth in such Section,
payments in respect of the principal of and any premium and interest on such Securities of such series when payments are due, (2) the
Issuer’s and each Guarantor’s obligations with respect to such Securities of such series under Sections 304, 305, 306, 1002,
1003 and 1007, (3) the rights (including without limitation, the rights set forth in Section 607), powers, trusts, duties and
immunities of the Trustee hereunder and (4) this Article. Subject to compliance with this Article, the Issuer or a Guarantor may
defease any Securities pursuant to this Section notwithstanding the prior Covenant Defeasance of such Securities pursuant to Section 1203.

Defeasance

Upon the Issuer’s or a Guarantor’s exercise
of the option provided in Section 1201 to have this Section 1203 applied to the Outstanding Securities of any series, on and
after the date the applicable conditions set forth in Section 1204 are satisfied (hereinafter called “Covenant Defeasance”)

any event specified in Sections 501(3), 501(4), 501(5) or 501(7)(a) with respect to any obligations referred to in clause (1) of
this Section 1203 shall be deemed not to be or result in an Event of Default, in each case with respect to the Outstanding Securities
of such series as provided in this Section. For this purpose, such Covenant Defeasance means that the Issuer and the Guarantors may omit
to comply with and shall have no liability in respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such specified Section (to
the extent so specified in the case of Section 501(4)), whether directly or indirectly by reason of any reference elsewhere herein

(5) Such Defeasance or Covenant
Defeasance shall not cause the Trustee to have a conflicting interest within the meaning of the Trust Indenture Act (as if the provisions
of the Trust Indenture Act applied to this Indenture) (assuming all Securities are in default within the meaning of such Act and that
such Act applied to this Indenture).
(6) Such Defeasance or Covenant

qualifying trustee (solely for purposes of this Section and Section 1206, the Trustee and any such other trustee are referred
to collectively as the “Trustee”) pursuant to Section 1204 in respect of any Outstanding Securities shall be held in
trust and applied by the Trustee, in accordance with the provisions of such Securities and this Indenture, to the payment, either directly
or through any such Paying Agent (including the Issuer acting as its own Paying Agent) as the Trustee may determine, to the Holders of
such Securities, of all sums due and to become due thereon in respect of principal and any premium and interest, but money so held in
trust need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required by law.
68
The Issuer or a Guarantor, as the case may be, shall
pay and indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee or other charge imposed on or assessed against the Trustee or the trust created hereby
with respect to the U.S. Government Obligations deposited pursuant to Section 1204 or the principal and interest received in respect

the Trustee shall deliver or pay to the Issuer or the Guarantors, as the case may be, from time to time upon an Issuer Request any money
or U.S. Government Obligations held by it as provided in Section 1204 with respect to any Securities which, in the opinion of a
nationally recognized firm of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof delivered to the Trustee, are
in excess of the amount thereof which would then be required to be deposited to effect the Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance, as the
case may be, with respect to such Securities.
Section 1206
Reinstatement
.
If the Trustee or the Paying Agent is unable to
apply any money in accordance with this Article with respect to any Securities by reason of any order or judgment of any court or
governmental authority enjoining, restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, then the obligations under this Indenture and
such Securities from which the Issuer has been discharged or released pursuant to Section 1202 or 1203 shall be revived and reinstated
as though no deposit had occurred pursuant to this Article with respect to such Securities, until such time as the Trustee or Paying
Agent is permitted to apply all money held in trust pursuant to Section 1205 with respect to such Securities in accordance with
this Article;
provided
, however, that if the Issuer or a Guarantor makes any payment of principal of or any premium or interest
on any such Security following such reinstatement of its obligations, the Issuer or a Guarantor shall be subrogated to the rights (if
any) of the Holders of such Securities to receive such payment from the money so held in trust.
ARTICLE Thirteen
GUARANTEE
Section 1301
Guarantee
.
The Guarantors jointly and severally hereby fully
and unconditionally guarantee to each Holder of a Security of each series authenticated and delivered by the Trustee the due and punctual
payment of the principal (including any amount due in respect of original issue discount) of and any premium and interest on such Security
(and any Additional Amounts and other amounts payable by the Issuer in respect thereof), when and as the same shall become due and payable,
whether at the Stated Maturity, by declaration of acceleration, call for redemption or otherwise, in accordance with the terms of such
Security and of this Indenture. The Guarantors jointly and severally hereby agree to pay to the Trustee any amount due it for the compensation
(as per the fee proposal agreed upon between the Issuer and the Trustee) and reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee,
its agents, officers, employees and directors, and any other amounts, including indemnification amounts, due to the Trustee under Section 607.
The Guarantors each hereby agree that its obligations hereunder shall be as if it were a principal debtor and not merely a surety, and
shall be absolute and unconditional, irrespective of, and shall be unaffected by, any invalidity, irregularity or unenforceability of
any Security of any series or this Indenture, any failure to enforce the provisions of any Security of any series or this Indenture,
any waiver, modification or indulgence granted to the Issuer with respect thereto, by the Holder of any Security of any series or the
Trustee, or any other circumstances which may otherwise constitute a legal or equitable discharge of a surety or guarantor;
provided
,
however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, no such waiver, modification or indulgence shall, without the consent of the Guarantors,
increase the principal amount of a Security or the interest rate thereon or increase any premium payable upon redemption thereof. The
Guarantors each hereby waive diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a court in the event of merger or bankruptcy
of the Issuer, any right to require a proceeding first against the Issuer, the benefit of discussion, protest or notice with respect
to any Security or the indebtedness evidenced thereby or with respect of any sinking fund payment required pursuant to the terms of a
Security issued under this Indenture and all demands whatsoever, and covenants that its Guarantee will not be discharged with respect
to any Security except by payment in full of the principal thereof and any premium and interest thereon or as provided in Article Four,
Section 802 or Article Thirteen. The Guarantors each further agree that, as between such Guarantor, on the one hand, and the
Holders and the Trustee, on the other hand, the Maturity of the obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article Five
hereof for the purposes of its Guarantee, but not in the case of any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration
in respect of the obligations guaranteed hereby.
69
The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder will
be limited (i) to the maximum amount as will, taking into account, in addition to such obligations of each Guarantor, all other
contingent and fixed liabilities of such Guarantor and any collections from or payments made by or on behalf of any other Guarantor in
respect of the obligations of such other Guarantor under its Guarantee or pursuant to its contribution obligations under this Indenture,
result in the obligations of such Guarantor under its Guarantee not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under
applicable law nor leading to a breach of the rules governing financial assistance, corporate purpose, ultra vires, impairment of
statutory capital or similar capital restrictions under applicable law and/or (ii) to the extent otherwise necessary so that such
obligations do not constitute a breach of applicable law.
The Guarantors shall be subrogated to all rights
of each Holder of Securities against the Issuer in respect of any amounts paid to such Holder by the Guarantors pursuant to the provisions
of these Guarantees;
provided
, however, that the Guarantors shall not be entitled to enforce, or to receive any payments arising
out of or based upon, such right of subrogation until the principal of and any premium and interest on all the Securities of the same
series and of like tenor shall have been paid in full.
No past, present or future stockholder, officer,
director, employee or incorporator of any Guarantor shall have any personal liability under the Guarantees set forth in this Section 1301
by reason of his or its status as such stockholder, officer, director, employee or incorporator.
The Guarantees set forth in this Section 1301
shall not be valid or become obligatory for any purpose with respect to a Security until the certificate of authentication on such Security
shall have been signed by or on behalf of the Trustee.
For the avoidance of doubt, the fact that none of
the Guarantors (including, without limitation, any New Guarantors) have or will execute any Security, or any notation of their Guarantees
on any Security, authenticated and delivered by the Trustee shall in no way affect or limit such Guarantor’s Guarantee under this
Section 1301.
Section 1302
Release
of Subsidiary Guarantors
.
Any or all of the Subsidiary Guarantors may be released
at any time from their respective Guarantees and other obligations under this Indenture without the consent of any Holder. Such release
shall occur upon or concurrently with the Subsidiary Guarantor no longer being a Relevant Guarantor and the delivery of an Officer’s
Certificate of Release to the Trustee certifying the same,
provided
that, at the time of such release, no default or Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing.
Concurrently with the delivery of such Officer’s
Certificate of Release to the Trustee and without any further act of any other party, such Subsidiary Guarantor shall be automatically
and unconditionally released from its Guarantee and other obligations under this Indenture and shall have no further liability or responsibility
under the Securities or this Indenture. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the release of a Subsidiary of the Parent Guarantor as a Subsidiary
Guarantor shall not preclude such Subsidiary subsequently becoming a Guarantor if, while the Securities are Outstanding, such Subsidiary
becomes a Relevant Guarantor subsequent to such release.
