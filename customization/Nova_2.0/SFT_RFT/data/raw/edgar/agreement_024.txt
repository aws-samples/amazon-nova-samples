 be registered and issued to the beneficial owners of such Warrants or their nominees as directed
 by the holder. The Corporation shall provide a certificate executed by an officer of the
 Corporation giving notice to the Warrant Agent of the occurrence of any event outlined in
 this Section 2.6(2).

Subject
 to the provisions of this Section 2.6, any exchange of CDS Global Warrants for Warrants which
 are not CDS Global Warrants may be made in whole or in part in accordance with the provisions
 of Section 2.11, mutatis mutandis. All such Warrants issued in exchange for a CDS Global
 Warrant or any portion thereof shall be registered in such names as the Depository for such
 CDS Global Warrants shall direct and shall be entitled to the same benefits and be subject
 to the same terms and conditions (except insofar as they relate specifically to CDS Global
 Warrants) as the CDS Global Warrants or portion thereof surrendered upon such exchange.
(4)
Every
 Warrant that is Authenticated upon registration or transfer of a CDS Global Warrant, or in
 exchange for or in lieu of a CDS Global Warrant or any portion thereof, whether pursuant
 to this Section 2.6, or otherwise, shall be Authenticated in the form of, and shall be, a
 CDS Global Warrant, unless such Warrant is registered in the name of a person other than
 the Depository for such CDS Global Warrant or a nominee thereof.
(5)
Notwithstanding
 anything to the contrary in this Indenture, subject to Applicable Legislation, the CDS Global
 Warrant will be issued as an Uncertificated Warrant, unless otherwise requested in writing
 by the Depository or the Corporation.
(6)
The
 rights of beneficial owners of Warrants who hold securities entitlements in respect of the
 Warrants through the book entry registration system shall be limited to those established
 by applicable law and agreements between the Depository and the Book Entry Participants and
 between such Book Entry Participants and the beneficial owners of Warrants who hold securities
 entitlements in respect of the Warrants through the book entry registration system, and such
 rights must be exercised through a Book Entry Participant in accordance with the rules and
 procedures of the Depository.
(7)
Notwithstanding
 anything herein to the contrary, neither the Corporation nor the Warrant Agent nor any agent
 thereof shall have any responsibility or liability for:
(a)
the
 electronic records maintained by the Depository relating to any ownership interests or any
 other interests in the Warrants or the depository system maintained by the Depository, or
 payments made on account of any ownership interest or any other interest of any person in
 any Warrant represented by an electronic position in the book entry registration system (other
 than the Depository or its nominee);
-
11
-
(b)
maintaining,
 supervising or reviewing any records of the Depository or any Book Entry Participant relating
 to any such interest; or
(c)
any
 advice or representation made or given by the Depository or those contained herein that relate
 to the rules and regulations of the Depository or any action to be taken by the Depository
 on its own direction or at the direction of any Book Entry Participant.
(8)
The
 Corporation may terminate the application of this Section 2.6 in its sole discretion in which
 case all Warrants shall be evidenced by Warrant Certificates registered in the name of a
 Person other than the Depository.
Section
2.7 Warrant Certificate.
(1)
For
 Warrants issued in certificated form, the form of certificate representing such Warrants
 shall be substantially as set out in Schedule “A” hereto or such other form as
 is authorized from time to time by the Warrant Agent. Each Warrant Certificate shall be Authenticated
 on behalf of the Warrant Agent. Each Warrant Certificate shall be signed by any two duly
 authorized signatories of the Corporation; whose signature shall appear on the Warrant Certificate
 and may be printed, lithographed or otherwise mechanically reproduced thereon and, in such
 event, certificates so signed are as valid and binding upon the Corporation as if it had
 been signed manually. Any Warrant Certificate which has two signatures duly executed by the
 Corporation as hereinbefore provided shall be valid notwithstanding that one or more of the
 persons whose signature is printed, lithographed or mechanically reproduced no longer holds
 office at the date of issuance of such Warrant Certificate. The Warrant Certificates may
 be engraved, printed or lithographed, or partly in one form and partly in another, as the
 Warrant Agent may determine.
(2)
The
 Warrant Agent shall Authenticate Uncertificated Warrants (whether upon original issuance,
 exchange, registration of transfer, partial payment, or otherwise) by completing its Internal
 Procedures and the Corporation shall, and hereby acknowledges that it shall, thereupon be
 deemed to have duly and validly issued such Uncertificated Warrants under this Indenture.
 Such Authentication shall be conclusive evidence that such Uncertificated Warrant has been
 duly issued hereunder and that the holder or holders are entitled to the benefits of this
 Indenture. The register shall be final and conclusive evidence as to all matters relating
 to Uncertificated Warrants with respect to which this Indenture requires the Warrant Agent
 to maintain records or accounts. In case of differences between the register at any time
 and any other time the register at the later time shall be controlling, absent manifest error
 and such Uncertificated Warrants are binding on the Corporation.
(3)
Any
 Warrant Certificate validly issued in accordance with the terms of this Indenture in effect
 at the time of issue of such Warrant Certificate shall, subject to the terms of this Indenture
 and Applicable Legislation, validly entitle the holder to acquire Warrant Shares, notwithstanding
 that the form of such Warrant Certificate may not be in the form currently required by this
 Indenture.
-
12
-
(4)
No
 Warrant shall be considered issued and shall be valid or obligatory or shall entitle the
 holder thereof to the benefits of this Indenture, until it has been Authenticated by the
 Warrant Agent. Authentication by the Warrant Agent, including by way of entry on the register,
 shall not be construed as a representation or warranty by the Warrant Agent as to the validity
 of this Indenture or of such Warrant Certificates or Uncertificated Warrants (except the
 due Authentication thereof) or as to the performance by the Corporation of its obligations
 under this Indenture and the Warrant Agent shall in no respect be liable or answerable for
 the use made of the Warrants or any of them or of the consideration thereof. Authentication
 by the Warrant Agent shall be conclusive evidence as against the Corporation that the Warrants
 so Authenticated have been duly issued hereunder and that the holder thereof is entitled
 to the benefits of this Indenture.
(5)
No
 Warrant Certificate shall be considered issued and Authenticated or, if Authenticated, shall
 be obligatory or shall entitle the holder thereof to the benefits of this Indenture, until
 it has been Authenticated by signature by or on behalf of the Warrant Agent substantially
 in the form of the Warrant set out in Schedule “A” hereto. Such Authentication
 on any such Warrant Certificate shall be conclusive evidence that such Warrant Certificate
 is duly Authenticated and is valid and a binding obligation of the Corporation and that the
 holder is entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
(6)
No
 Uncertificated Warrant shall be considered issued and shall be obligatory or shall entitle
 the holder thereof to the benefits of this Indenture, until it has been Authenticated by
 entry on the register of the particulars of the Uncertificated Warrant. Such entry on the
 register of the particulars of an Uncertificated Warrant shall be conclusive evidence that
 such Uncertificated Warrant is a valid and binding obligation of the Corporation and that
 the holder is entitled to the benefits of this Indenture.
Section
2.8 Legends.
(1)
Neither
 the Warrants nor the Warrant Shares have been registered under the U.S. Securities Act or
 under any United States state securities laws. If required under United States securities
 laws, Warrant Certificates originally issued for the benefit or account of a U.S. Warrantholder
 and each Warrant Certificate issued in exchange therefor or in substitution thereof shall
 bear or be deemed to bear the following legends or such variations thereof as the Corporation
 may prescribe from time to time:
-
13
-
“THE
SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY AND THE SECURITIES ISSUABLE UPON EXERCISE HEREOF HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE UNITED STATES SECURITIES
ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “U.S. SECURITIES ACT”), OR THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE OF THE UNITED STATES. THE HOLDER
HEREOF, BY PURCHASING SUCH SECURITIES, AGREES FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE CORPORATION THAT SUCH SECURITIES MAY BE OFFERED, SOLD, PLEDGED OR
OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED ONLY (A) TO THE CORPORATION, (B) OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN COMPLIANCE WITH RULE 904 OF REGULATION S UNDER THE
U.S. SECURITIES ACT AND IN COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, (C) IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION
UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT PROVIDED BY RULE 144 THEREUNDER, IF AVAILABLE, AND IN COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE U.S. STATE SECURITIES
LAWS, (D) IN ANOTHER TRANSACTION THAT DOES NOT REQUIRE REGISTRATION UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT OR ANY APPLICABLE U.S. STATE SECURITIES
LAWS, OR (E) PURSUANT TO A REGISTRATION STATEMENT THAT HAS BEEN DECLARED EFFECTIVE UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT, AND, IN THE CASE OF
(C) AND (D) ABOVE, AFTER THE SELLER FURNISHES TO THE CORPORATION AND COMPUTERSHARE TRUST COMPANY OF CANADA AN OPINION OF COUNSEL OF RECOGNIZED
STANDING OR OTHER EVIDENCE IN FORM AND SUBSTANCE REASONABLY SATISFACTORY TO THE CORPORATION TO SUCH EFFECT. DELIVERY OF THIS CERTIFICATE
MAY NOT CONSTITUTE “GOOD DELIVERY” IN SETTLEMENT OF TRANSACTIONS ON STOCK EXCHANGES IN CANADA.”;
provided
that, if the Warrants are being sold outside the United States in accordance with Rule 904 of Regulation S, this legend may be removed
by the transferor providing a declaration to the Warrant Agent in the form set forth in Schedule “C” attached hereto or as
the Warrant Agent or the Corporation may prescribe from time to time, and if required by the Warrant Agent, an opinion of counsel, of
recognised standing reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation and the Warrant Agent, that the proposed transfer may be effected without
registration under the U.S. Securities Act;
provided
further, that, if the Warrants are being sold pursuant to Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities Act, the legend may be removed by delivery
to the Corporation and the Warrant Agent of an opinion of counsel of recognised standing or other evidence in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Corporation to the effect that the legend is no longer required under applicable requirements of the U.S. Securities
Act or U.S. state securities laws.
The
Warrant Agent shall be entitled to request any other documents that it may require in accordance with its internal policies for the removal
of the legend set forth above.
-
14
-
(2)
Each
 CDS Global Warrant, if issued on a certificated basis, originally issued in Canada and held
 by the Depository, and each CDS Global Warrant issued in exchange therefor or in substitution
 thereof shall bear or be deemed to bear the following legend or such variations thereof as
 the Corporation may prescribe from time to time:
“UNLESS
THIS CERTIFICATE IS PRESENTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF CDS CLEARING AND DEPOSITORY SERVICES INC. (“CDS”) TO NEXMETALS
MINING CORP. (THE “ISSUER”) OR ITS AGENT FOR REGISTRATION OF TRANSFER, EXCHANGEOR PAYMENT, AND ANY CERTIFICATE ISSUED IN
RESPECT THEREOF IS REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF CDS & CO, OR IN SUCH OTHER NAME AS IS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF CDS
(AND ANY PAYMENT IS MADE TO CDS & CO. OR TO SUCH OTHER ENTITY AS IS REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF CDS), ANY TRANSFER,
PLEDGE OR OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS WRONGFUL SINCE THE REGISTERED HOLDER HEREOF, CDS & CO.,
HAS A PROPERTY INTEREST IN THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HEREIN AND IT IS A VIOLATION OF ITS RIGHTS FOR ANOTHER PERSON
TO HOLD, TRANSFER OR DEAL WITH THIS CERTIFICATE.”
(4)
Notwithstanding
 any other provisions of this Indenture, in processing and registering transfers of Warrants,
 no duty or responsibility whatsoever shall rest upon the Warrant Agent to determine the compliance
 by any transferor or transferee with the terms of the legend contained in Section 2.8(1)
 or Section 2.8(2), or with the relevant securities laws or regulations, including, without
 limitation, Regulation S, and the Warrant Agent shall be entitled to assume that all transfers
 are legal and proper.
Section
2.9 Register of Warrants
(1)
The
 Warrant Agent shall maintain records and accounts concerning the Warrants, whether certificated
 or uncertificated, which shall contain the information called for below with respect to each
 Warrant, together with such other information as may be required by law or as the Warrant
 Agent may elect to record. All such information shall be kept in one set of accounts and
 records which the Warrant Agent shall designate (in such manner as shall permit it to be
 so identified as such by an unaffiliated party) as the register of the holders of Warrants.
 The information to be entered for each account in the register of Warrants at any time shall
 include (without limitation):
(a)
the
 name and address of the Registered Warrantholder, the date of Authentication thereof and
 the number of Warrants;
(b)
whether
 such Warrant is a Warrant Certificate or an Uncertificated Warrant and, if a Warrant Certificate,
 the unique number or code assigned to and imprinted thereupon and, if an Uncertificated Warrant,
 the unique number or code assigned thereto if any;
-
15
-
(c)
whether
 such Warrant has been cancelled; and
(d)
a
 register of transfers in which all transfers of Warrants and the date and other particulars
 of each transfer shall be entered.
The
register shall be available for inspection by the Corporation and or any Warrantholder during the Warrant Agent’s regular business
hours on a Business Day and upon payment to the Warrant Agent of its reasonable fees. Any Warrantholder exercising such right of inspection
shall first provide an affidavit in form satisfactory to the Corporation and the Warrant Agent stating the name and address of the Warrantholder
and agreeing not to use the information therein except in connection with an effort to call a meeting of Warrantholders or to influence
the voting of Warrantholders at any meeting of Warrantholders.
(2)
Once
 an Uncertificated Warrant has been Authenticated, the information set forth in the register
 with respect thereto at the time of Authentication may be altered, modified, amended, supplemented
 or otherwise changed only to reflect exercise or proper instructions to the Warrant Agent
 from the holder as provided herein, except that the Warrant Agent may act unilaterally to
 make purely administrative changes internal to the Warrant Agent and changes to correct errors.
 Each person who becomes a holder of an Uncertificated Warrant, by his, her or its acquisition
 thereof shall be deemed to have irrevocably (i) consented to the foregoing authority of the
 Warrant Agent to make such minor error corrections and (ii) agreed to pay to the Warrant
 Agent, promptly upon written demand, the full amount of all loss and expense (including without
 limitation reasonable legal fees of the Corporation and the Warrant Agent plus interest,
 at an appropriate then prevailing rate of interest to the Warrant Agent), sustained by the
 Corporation or the Warrant Agent as a proximate result of such error if but only if and only
 to the extent that such present or former holder realized any benefit as a result of such
 error and could reasonably have prevented, forestalled or minimized such loss and expense
 by prompt reporting of the error or avoidance of accepting benefits thereof whether or not
 such error is or should have been timely detected and corrected by the Warrant Agent; provided,
 that no person who is a bona fide purchaser shall have any such obligation to the Corporation
 or to the Warrant Agent.
Section
2.10 Issue in Substitution for Warrant Certificates Lost, etc.
(1)
If
 any Warrant Certificate becomes mutilated or is lost, destroyed or stolen, the Corporation,
 subject to applicable law, shall issue and thereupon the Warrant Agent shall certify and
 deliver, a new Warrant Certificate of like tenor, and bearing the same legend, if applicable,
 as the one mutilated, lost, destroyed or stolen in exchange for and in place of and upon
 cancellation of such mutilated Warrant Certificate, or in lieu of and in substitution for
 such lost, destroyed or stolen Warrant Certificate, and the substituted Warrant Certificate
 shall be in a form approved by the Warrant Agent and the Warrants evidenced thereby shall
 be entitled to the benefits hereof and shall rank equally in accordance with its terms with
 all other Warrants issued or to be issued hereunder.
-
16
-
(2)
The
 applicant for the issue of a new Warrant Certificate pursuant to this Section 2.10 shall
 bear the cost of the issue thereof and in case of loss, destruction or theft shall, as a
 condition precedent to the issuance thereof, furnish to the Corporation and to the Warrant
 Agent such evidence of ownership and of the loss, destruction or theft of the Warrant Certificate
 so lost, destroyed or stolen as shall be satisfactory to the Corporation and to the Warrant
 Agent, in their sole discretion, and such applicant shall also be required to furnish an
 indemnity and surety bond in amount and form satisfactory to the Corporation and the Warrant
 Agent, in their sole discretion, and shall pay the reasonable charges of the Corporation
 and the Warrant Agent in connection therewith.
Section
2.11 Exchange of Warrant Certificates.
(1)
Any
 one or more Warrant Certificates representing any number of Warrants may, upon compliance
 with the reasonable requirements of the Warrant Agent (including compliance with applicable
 securities legislation), be exchanged for one or more other Warrant Certificates representing
 the same aggregate number of Warrants, and bearing the same legend, if applicable, as represented
 by the Warrant Certificate or Warrant Certificates so exchanged.
(2)
Warrant
 Certificates may be exchanged only at the Warrant Agency or at any other place that is designated
 by the Corporation with the approval of the Warrant Agent. Any Warrant Certificate from the
 holder (or such other instructions, in form satisfactory to the Warrant Agent), tendered
 for exchange shall be surrendered to the Warrant Agency and cancelled by the Warrant Agent.
(3)
Warrant
 Certificates exchanged for Warrant Certificates that bear the legend set forth in Section
 2.8(1) shall bear the same legend.
Section
2.12 Transfer and Ownership of Warrants.
(1)
The
 Warrants may only be transferred on the register kept by the Warrant Agent at the Warrant
 Agency by the holder or its legal representatives or its attorney duly appointed by an instrument
 in writing in form and execution satisfactory to the Warrant Agent only upon (a) in the case
 of a Warrant Certificate, surrendering to the Warrant Agent at the Warrant Agency the Warrant
 Certificates representing the Warrants to be transferred together with a duly executed transfer
 form as set forth in Schedule “A” attached hereto, (b) in the case of Book Entry
 Warrants, in accordance with procedures prescribed by the Depository under the book entry
 registration system, and (c) upon compliance with:
-
17
-
(i)
the
 conditions herein;
(ii)
such
 reasonable requirements as the Warrant Agent may prescribe; and
(iii)
all
 applicable securities legislation and requirements of regulatory authorities;
and
such transfer shall be duly noted in such register by the Warrant Agent. Upon compliance with such requirements, the Warrant Agent shall
issue to the transferee of a Warrant Certificate, a Warrant Certificate and to the transferee of an Uncertificated Warrant, an Uncertificated
Warrant, or the Warrant Agent shall Authenticate and deliver a Warrant Certificate upon request that part of the CDS Global Warrant be
certificated. Transfers within the systems of the Depository are not the responsibility of the Warrant Agent and will not be noted on
the register maintained by the Warrant Agent.
(2)
If
 a Warrant Certificate tendered for transfer bears the legend set forth in Section 2.8(1),
 the Warrant Agent shall not register such transfer unless the transferor has provided the
 Warrant Agent with the Warrant Certificate and (A) the transfer is made to the Corporation,
 (B) a declaration to the effect set forth in Schedule “C” to this Warrant Indenture,
 or in such other form as the Corporation may from time to time prescribe, is delivered to
 the Warrant Agent, and if required by the Warrant Agent, the transferor provides an opinion
 of counsel of recognized standing, reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation and the Warrant
 Agent that the proposed transfer is exempt from registration with applicable state laws and
 the U.S. Securities Act and that such legends may be removed, or (C) the transfer is made
 pursuant to another exemption from registration under the U.S. Securities Act (including,
 without limitation, Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities Act) and any applicable U.S. state
 securities laws, and an opinion of counsel of recognized standing, reasonably satisfactory
 to the Corporation and the Warrant Agent, is delivered to the Corporation and the Warrant
 Agent that such transfer may be effected without registration under the U.S. Securities Act.
(3)
Subject
 to the provisions of this Indenture, Applicable Legislation and applicable law, the Warrantholder
 shall be entitled to the rights and privileges attaching to the Warrants, and the issue of
 Warrant Shares by the Corporation upon the exercise of Warrants in accordance with the terms
 and conditions herein contained shall discharge all responsibilities of the Corporation and
 the Warrant Agent with respect to such Warrants and neither the Corporation nor the Warrant
 Agent shall be bound to inquire into the title of any such holder.
-
18
-
Section
2.13 Cancellation of Surrendered Warrants.

shall furnish to the Corporation a cancellation certificate identifying the Warrant Certificates so cancelled, the number of Warrants
evidenced thereby, the number of Warrant Shares, if any, issued pursuant to such Warrants and the details of any Warrant Certificates
issued in substitution or exchange for such Warrant Certificates cancelled.
Article
3
EXERCISE OF WARRANTS
Section
3.1 Right of Exercise.
Subject
to the provisions hereof, each Registered Warrantholder may exercise the right conferred on such holder to subscribe for and purchase
one (1) Warrant Share for each Warrant after the Issue Date and prior to the Expiry Time and in accordance with the conditions herein;
provided, however, that if a Warrant Certificate tendered for exercise bears the legend set forth in Section 2.8(1), such exercise must
be permitted under applicable U.S. Securities Law.
Section
3.2 Warrant Exercise.
(1)
Other
 than Warrants held by the Depository, Registered Warrantholders of Warrant Certificates who
 wish to exercise the Warrants held by them in order to acquire Warrant Shares must complete
 the exercise form (the “
Exercise Notice
”) attached to the Warrant Certificate(s)
 which form is attached hereto as Schedule “B”, which may be amended by the Corporation
 with the consent of the Warrant Agent, if such amendment does not, in the reasonable opinion
 of the Corporation and the Warrant Agent, which may be based on the advice of Counsel, materially
 and adversely affect the rights, entitlements and interests of the Warrantholders, and deliver
 such certificate(s), the executed Exercise Notice and a certified cheque, bank draft or money
 order payable to or to the order of the Corporation for the aggregate Exercise Price to the
 Warrant Agent at the Warrant Agency. The Warrants represented by a Warrant Certificate shall
 be deemed to be surrendered upon personal delivery of such certificate, Exercise Notice and
 aggregate Exercise Price or, if such documents are sent by mail or other means of transmission,
 upon actual receipt thereof by the Warrant Agent at the office referred to above.
(2)
In
 addition to completing the Exercise Notice attached to the Warrant Certificate(s), a U.S.
 Warrantholder must (a) provide a completed and executed U.S. Purchaser Letter or (b) an opinion
 of counsel of recognised standing in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Corporation
 and the Warrant Agent that the exercise is exempt from the registration requirements of applicable
 securities laws of any state of the United States and the U.S. Securities Act;
provided
 however
that in the case of a U.S. Warrantholder that is the original purchaser of Warrants
 and who delivered the U.S. Accredited Investor Agreement attached to the U.S. Private Placement
 Memorandum of the Corporation in connection with its purchase of Units pursuant to the Offering,
 such U.S. Warrantholder will not be required to deliver a U.S. Purchaser Letter or an opinion
 of counsel in connection with the due exercise of the Warrant at a time when the representations,
 warranties and covenants made by the U.S. Warrantholder in the U.S. Accredited Investor Agreement
 remain true and correct and the U.S. Warrantholder represents to the Corporation as such.
-
19
-
(3)
A
 Registered Warrantholder of Uncertificated Warrants evidenced by a security entitlement in
 respect of Warrants must complete the Exercise Notice and deliver the executed Exercise Notice
 and a certified cheque, bank draft or money order payable to or to the order of the Corporation
 for the aggregate Exercise Price to the Warrant Agent at the Warrant Agency. The Uncertificated
 Warrants shall be deemed to be surrendered upon receipt of the Exercise Notice and aggregate
 Exercise Price or, if such documents are sent by mail or other means of transmission, upon
 actual receipt thereof by the Warrant Agent at the office referred to above.
(4)
A
 beneficial owner of Uncertificated Warrants evidenced by a security entitlement in respect
 of Warrants in the book entry registration system who desires to exercise his or her Warrants
 must do so by causing a Book Entry Participant to deliver to the Depository on behalf of
 the entitlement holder, notice of the owner’s intention to exercise Warrants in a manner
 acceptable to the Depository. Forthwith upon receipt by the Depository of such notice, as
 well as payment for the aggregate Exercise Price, the Depository shall deliver to the Warrant
 Agent confirmation of its intention to exercise Warrants (a “Confirmation”) in
 a manner acceptable to the Warrant Agent, including by electronic means through a book based
 registration system, including CDSX. An electronic exercise of the Warrants initiated by
 the Book Entry Participant through a book based registration system, including CDSX, shall
 constitute a representation to both the Corporation and the Warrant Agent that the beneficial
 owner at the time of exercise of such Warrants is not a U.S. Warrantholder. If the Book Entry
 Participant is not able to make or deliver the foregoing representations by initiating the
 electronic exercise of the Warrants, then such Warrants shall be withdrawn from the book
 based registration system, including CDSX, by the Book Entry Participant and an individually
 registered Warrant Certificate shall be issued by the Warrant Agent to such beneficial owner
 or Book Entry Participant and the exercise procedures set forth in Section 3.2(1) shall be
 followed.
(5)
Payment
 representing the aggregate Exercise Price must be provided to the appropriate office of the
 Book Entry Participant in a manner acceptable to it. A notice in form acceptable to the Book
 Entry Participant and payment from such beneficial holder should be provided to the Book
 Entry Participant suffi
c
iently in advance so as to permit the Book Entry Participant
 to deliver notice and payment to the Depository and for the Depository in turn to deliver
 notice and payment to the Warrant Agent prior to the Expiry Time. The Depository will initiate
 the exercise by way of the Confirmation and forward the aggregate Exercise Price electronically
 to the Warrant Agent and the Warrant Agent will execute the exercise by issuing to the Depository
 through the book entry registration system the Warrant Shares to which the exercising Warrantholder
 is entitled pursuant to the exercise. Any expense associated with the exercise process will
 be for the account of the entitlement holder exercising the Warrants and/or the Book Entry
 Participant exercising the Warrants on its behalf.
-
20
-
(6)
By
 causing a Book Entry Participant to deliver notice to the Depository, a Warrantholder shall
 be deemed to have irrevocably surrendered his or her Warrants so exercised and appointed
 such Book Entry Participant to act as his or her exclusive settlement agent with respect
 to the exercise and the receipt of Warrant Shares in connection with the obligations arising
 from such exercise.
(7)
Any
 notice which the Depository determines to be incomplete, not in proper form or not duly executed
 shall for all purposes be void and of no force and effect and the exercise to which it relates
 shall be considered for all purposes not to have been exercised thereby. A failure by a Book
 Entry Participant to exercise or to give effect to the settlement thereof in accordance with
 the Warrantholder’s instructions will not give rise to any obligations or liability
 on the part of the Corporation or Warrant Agent to the Book Entry Participant or the Warrantholder.
(8)
The
 Exercise Notice referred to in this Section 3.2 shall be signed by the Registered Warrantholder,
 or its executors or administrators or other legal representatives or an attorney of the Registered
 Warrantholder, duly appointed by an instrument in writing satisfactory to the Warrant Agent
 but such Exercise Notice need not be executed by the Depository.
(9)
Any
 exercise referred to in this Section 3.2 shall require that the entire Exercise Price for
 Warrant Shares subscribed must be paid at the time of subscription and such Exercise Price
 and original Exercise Notice executed by the Registered Warrantholder or the Confirmation
 from the Depository must be received by the Warrant Agent prior to the Expiry Time.
(10)
Warrants
 may only be exercised pursuant to this Section 3.2 by or on behalf of a Registered Warrantholder,
 as applicable, who makes the certifications set forth on the Exercise Notice set out in Schedule
 “B” or as provided herein.
(11)
If
 the form of Exercise Notice set forth in the Warrant Certificate shall have been amended,
 the Corporation shall cause the amended Exercise Notice to be forwarded to all Registered
 Warrantholders.
-
21
-
(12)
Exercise
 Notices and Confirmations must be delivered to the Warrant Agent at any time during the Warrant
 Agent’s actual business hours on any Business Day prior to the Expiry Time. Any Exercise
 Notice or Confirmations received by the Warrant Agent after business hours on any Business
 Day other than the Expiry Date will be deemed to have been received by the Warrant Agent
 on the next following Business Day.
(13)
Any
 Warrant with respect to which a Confirmation or Exercise Notice is not received by the Warrant
 Agent before the Expiry Time shall be deemed to have expired and become void and all rights
 with respect to such Warrants shall terminate and be cancelled.
Section
3.3 Restrictions on Exercise by U.S. Persons; Legended Certificates
(1)
Warrants
 which bear the legend set forth in Section 2.8(1) may be exercised in the United States or
 by or on behalf of a U.S. Person, and Warrant Shares issued upon exercise of any such Warrants
 may be delivered to an address in the United States, provided that (a) the Person exercising
 the Warrants (i) is an original U.S. Purchaser who purchased the Warrants directly from the
 Corporation or (ii) is a U.S. Accredited Investor and (b) delivers a completed and executed
 U.S. Purchaser Letter or provides in form and substance satisfactory to the Corporation and
 Warrant Agent a legal opinion which confirms that issuance of shares is in compliance with
 the applicable state laws and the U.S. Securities Act;
provided however
that in the
 case of a U.S. Warrantholder that is the original U.S. Purchaser of the Warrants and who
 delivered the U.S. Accredited Investor Agreement attached to the U.S. Private Placement Memorandum
 of the Corporation in connection with its purchase of Units pursuant to the Offering under
 which the Warrants were issued, such U.S. Warrantholder will not be required to deliver a
 U.S. Purchaser Letter or an opinion of counsel in connection with the due exercise of the
 Warrant at a time when the representations, warranties and covenants made by the U.S. Warrantholder
 in the U.S. Accredited Investor Agreement remain true and correct and the U.S. Warrantholder
 represents to the Corporation as such.
(2)
Certificates
 representing Warrant Shares issued upon the exercise of Warrants which bear the legend set
 forth in Section 2.8(1) or which are issued and delivered pursuant to Section 3.3(1) shall
 bear the following legend:
“THE
SECURITIES REPRESENTED HEREBY HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE UNITED STATES SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE “U.S. SECURITIES
ACT”), OR THE SECURITIES LAWS OF ANY STATE OF THE UNITED STATES. THE HOLDER HEREOF, BY PURCHASING SUCH SECURITIES, AGREES FOR THE
BENEFIT OF THE CORPORATION THAT SUCH SECURITIES MAY BE OFFERED, SOLD, PLEDGED OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED ONLY (A) TO THE CORPORATION, (B)
OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES IN COMPLIANCE WITH RULE 904 OF REGULATION S UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT AND IN COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE
LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, (C) IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT PROVIDED BY RULE 144
THEREUNDER, IF AVAILABLE, AND IN COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE U.S. STATE SECURITIES LAWS, (D) IN ANOTHER TRANSACTION THAT DOES NOT REQUIRE
REGISTRATION UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT OR ANY APPLICABLE U.S. STATE SECURITIES LAWS, OR (E) PURSUANT TO A REGISTRATION STATEMENT
THAT HAS BEEN DECLARED EFFECTIVE UNDER THE U.S. SECURITIES ACT, AND, IN THE CASE OF (C) AND (D) ABOVE, AFTER THE SELLER FURNISHES TO

(1)
Upon
 the exercise of Warrant Certificates pursuant to and in compliance with Section 3.2 and subject
 to Section 3.3 and Section 3.4, the Warrant Shares to be issued pursuant to the Warrants
 exercised shall be deemed to have been issued and the person or persons to whom such Warrant
 Shares are to be issued shall be deemed to have become the holder or holders of such Warrant
 Shares within five Business Days of the Exercise Date unless the register shall be closed
 on such date, in which case the Warrant Shares subscribed for shall be deemed to have been
 issued and such person or persons deemed to have become the holder or holders of record of
 such Warrant Shares, on the date on which such register is reopened. It is hereby understood
 that in order for persons to whom Warrant Shares are to be issued, to become holders of Warrant
 Shares on record on the Exercise Date, beneficial holders must commence the exercise process
 sufficiently in advance so that the Warrant Agent is in receipt of all items of exercise
 at least one Business Day prior to such Exercise Date.
(2)
Within
 five Business Days after the Exercise Date with respect to a Warrant, the Warrant Agent shall
 use commercially reasonable efforts to cause to be delivered or mailed to the person or persons

(1)
The
 holder of any Warrants may exercise his right to acquire a number of whole Warrant Shares
 less than the aggregate number which the holder is entitled to acquire. In the event of any
 exercise of a number of Warrants less than the number which the holder is entitled to exercise,
 the holder of Warrants upon such exercise shall, in addition, be entitled to receive, without
 charge therefor, a new Warrant Certificate(s), bearing the same legend, if applicable, or
 other appropriate evidence of Warrants, in respect of the balance of the Warrants held by
 such holder and which were not then exercised.
(2)
Notwithstanding
 anything herein contained including any adjustment provided for in Section 4.1, the Corporation
 shall not be required, upon the exercise of any Warrants, to issue fractions of Warrant Shares.

ADJUSTMENT OF NUMBER OF Warrant SHARES
AND EXERCISE PRICE
Section
4.1 Adjustment of Number of Warrant Shares and Exercise Price.
The
subscription rights in effect under the Warrants for Warrant Shares issuable upon the exercise of the Warrants shall be subject to adjustment
from time to time as follows:
(a)
if,
 at any time during the Adjustment Period, the Corporation shall:
(i)
subdivide,
 re-divide or change its outstanding Common Shares into a greater number of Common Shares;
(ii)
reduce,
 combine or consolidate its outstanding Common Shares into a lesser number of Common Shares;
 or
-
25
-
(iii)
issue
 Common Shares or securities exchangeable for, or convertible into, Common Shares to all or
 substantially all of the holders of Common Shares by way of stock dividend or other distribution
 (other than a distribution of Common Shares upon the exercise of Warrants or any outstanding
 options);
(any
of such events in Section 4.1(a) (i), (ii) or (iii) being called a “Common Share Reorganization”) then the Exercise Price
shall be adjusted as of the effect on the effective date or record date of such subdivision, re-division, change, reduction, combination,
consolidation or distribution, as the case may be, shall in the case of the events referred to in (i) or (iii) above be decreased in
proportion to the number of outstanding Common Shares resulting from such subdivision, re-division, change or distribution, or shall,
in the case of the events referred to in (ii) above, be increased in proportion to the number of outstanding Common Shares resulting
from such reduction, combination or consolidation by multiplying the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such effective date
or record date by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of Common Shares outstanding on such effective date or record
date before giving effect to such Common Share Reorganization and the denominator of which shall be the number of Common Shares outstanding
as of the effective date or record date after giving effect to such Common Share Reorganization (including, in the case where securities
exchangeable for or convertible into Common Shares are distributed, the number of Common Share that would have been outstanding had such
securities been exchanged for or converted into Common Shares on such record date or effective date). Such adjustment shall be made successively
whenever any event referred to in this Section 4.1(a) shall occur. Upon any adjustment of the Exercise Price pursuant to Section 4.1(a),
the Exchange Rate shall be contemporaneously adjusted by multiplying the number of Common Shares theretofore obtainable on the exercise
thereof by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment and the denominator
shall be the Exercise Price resulting from such adjustment;
-
26
-
(b)
if
 and whenever at any time during the Adjustment Period, the Corporation shall fix a record
 date for the issuance of rights, options or warrants to all or substantially all the holders
 of its outstanding Common Shares entitling them, for a period expiring not more than 45 days
 after such record date, to subscribe for or purchase Common Shares (or securities convertible
 or exchangeable into Common Shares) at a price per Common Share (or having a conversion or
 exchange price per Common Share) less than 95% of the Current Market Price on such record
 date (a “
Rights Offering
”), the Exercise Price shall be adjusted immediately
 after such record date so that it shall equal the amount determined by multiplying the Exercise
 Price in effect on such record date by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be the total
 number of Common Shares outstanding on such record date plus a number of Common Shares equal
 to the number arrived at by dividing the aggregate price of the total number of additional
 Common Shares offered for subscription or purchase (or the aggregate conversion or exchange
 price of the convertible or exchangeable securities so offered) by the Current Market Price,
 and of which the denominator shall be the total number of Common Shares outstanding on such
 record date plus the total number of additional Common Shares offered for subscription or
 purchase or into which the convertible or exchangeable securities so offered are convertible
 or exchangeable; any Common Shares owned by or held for the account of the Corporation shall
 be deemed not to be outstanding for the purpose of any such computation; such adjustment
 shall be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed; to the extent that no such
 rights or warrants are exercised prior to the expiration thereof, the Exercise Price shall
 be readjusted to the Exercise Price which would then be in effect if such record date had
 not been fixed or, if any such rights or warrants are exercised, to the Exercise Price which
 would then be in effect based upon the number of Common Shares (or securities convertible
 or exchangeable into Common Shares) actually issued upon the exercise of such rights or warrants,
 as the case may be. Upon any adjustment of the Exercise Price pursuant to this Section 4.1(b),
 the Exchange Rate will be adjusted immediately after such record date so that it will equal
 the rate determined by multiplying the Exchange Rate in effect on such record date by a fraction,
 of which the numerator shall be the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment
 and the denominator shall be the Exercise Price resulting from such adjustment. Such adjustment
 will be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed, provided that if two or more
 such record dates or record dates referred to in this Section 4.1(b) are fixed within a period
 of 25 Trading Days, such adjustment will be made successively as if each of such record dates
 occurred on the earliest of such record dates;
(c)
if
 and whenever at any time during the Adjustment Period the Corporation shall fix a record
 date for the making of a distribution to all or substantially all the holders of its outstanding
 Common Shares of (i) securities of any class, whether of the Corporation or any other entity
 (other than Common Shares), (ii) rights, options or warrants to subscribe for or purchase
 Common Shares (or other securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Shares), other
 than pursuant to a Rights Offering; (iii) evidences of its indebtedness or (iv) any property
 or other assets then, in each such case, the Exercise Price shall be adjusted immediately
 after such record date so that it shall equal the price determined by multiplying the Exercise
 Price in effect on such record date by a fraction, of which the numerator shall be the total
 number of Common Shares outstanding on such record date multiplied by the Current Market
 Price on such record date, less the excess, if any, of the fair market value on such record
 date, as determined by the Corporation (whose determination shall be conclusive), of such
 securities or other assets so issued or distributed over the fair market value of any consideration
 received therefor by the Corporation from the holders of the Common Shares, and of which
 the denominator shall be the total number of Common Shares outstanding on such record date
 multiplied by the Current Market Price; and Common Shares owned by or held for the account
 of the Corporation shall be deemed not to be outstanding for the purpose of any such computation;
 such adjustment shall be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed; to the extent
 that such distribution is not so made, the Exercise Price shall be readjusted to the Exercise
 Price which would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed. Upon any adjustment
 of the Exercise Price pursuant to this Section 4.1(c), the Exchange Rate will be adjusted
 immediately after such record date so that it will equal the rate determined by multiplying
 the Exchange Rate in effect on such record date by a fraction, of which the numerator shall
 be the Exercise Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment and the denominator
 shall be the Exercise Price resulting from such adjustment;
-
27
-
(d)
if
 and whenever at any time during the Adjustment Period, there is a reclassification of the
 Common Shares or a capital reorganization of the Corporation other than as described in Section
 4.1(a) or a consolidation, amalgamation, arrangement or merger of the Corporation with or
 into any other body corporate, trust, partnership or other entity, or a sale or conveyance
 of the property and assets of the Corporation as an entirety or substantially as an entirety
 to any other body corporate, trust, partnership or other entity, any Registered Warrantholder
 who has not exercised its right of acquisition prior to the effective date of such reclassification,
 capital reorganization, consolidation, amalgamation, arrangement or merger, sale or conveyance,
 upon the exercise of such right thereafter, shall be entitled to receive upon payment of
 the Exercise Price and shall accept, in lieu of the number of Warrant Shares that prior to
 such effective date the Registered Warrantholder would have been entitled to receive, the
 number of shares or other securities or property of the Corporation or of the body corporate,
 trust, partnership or other entity resulting from such merger, amalgamation or consolidation,
 or to which such sale or conveyance may be made, as the case may be, that such Registered
 Warrantholder would have been entitled to receive on such reclassification, capital reorganization,
 consolidation, amalgamation, arrangement or merger, sale or conveyance, if, on the effective
 date thereof, as the case may be, the Registered Warrantholder had been the registered holder
 of the number of Warrant Shares to which prior to such effective date it was entitled to
 acquire upon the exercise of the Warrants. If determined appropriate by the Warrant Agent,
 relying on advice of Counsel, to give effect to or to evidence the provisions of this Section
 4.1(d), the Corporation, its successor, or such purchasing body corporate, partnership, trust
 or other entity, as the case may be, shall, prior to or contemporaneously with any such reclassification,
 capital reorganization, consolidation, amalgamation, arrangement, merger, sale or conveyance,
 enter into an indenture which shall provide, to the extent possible, for the application
 of the provisions set forth in this Indenture with respect to the rights and interests thereafter
 of the Registered Warrantholders to the end that the provisions set forth in this Indenture
 shall thereafter correspondingly be made applicable, as nearly as may reasonably be, with
 respect to any shares, other securities or property to which a Registered Warrantholder is
 entitled on the exercise of its acquisition rights thereafter. Any indenture entered into
 between the Corporation and the Warrant Agent pursuant to the provisions of this Section
 4.1(d) shall be a supplemental indenture entered into pursuant to the provisions of Article
 8 hereof. Any indenture entered into between the Corporation, any successor to the Corporation
 or such purchasing body corporate, partnership, trust or other entity and the Warrant Agent
 shall provide for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to
 the adjustments provided in this Section 4.1 and which shall apply to successive reclassifications,
 capital reorganizations, amalgamations, consolidations, mergers, sales or conveyances;
-
28
-
(e)
in
 any case in which this Section 4.1 shall require that an adjustment shall become effective
 immediately after a record date for an event referred to herein, the Corporation may defer,
 until the occurrence of such event, issuing to the Registered Warrantholder of any Warrant
 exercised after the record date and prior to completion of such event the additional Warrant
 Shares issuable by reason of the adjustment required by such event before giving effect to
 such adjustment; provided, however, that the Corporation shall deliver to such Registered
 Warrantholder an appropriate instrument evidencing such Registered Warrantholder’s
 right to receive such additional Common Shares upon the occurrence of the event requiring
 such adjustment and the right to receive any distributions made on such additional Common
 Shares declared in favour of holders of record of Common Shares on and after the relevant
 date of exercise or such later date as such Registered Warrantholder would, but for the provisions
 of this Section 4.1(e), have become the holder of record of such additional Common Shares
 pursuant to Section 4.1;
(f)
in
 any case in which Section 4.1(a)(iii), Section 4.1(b) or Section 4.1(c) require that an adjustment
 be made to the Exercise Price, no such adjustment shall be made if the Registered Warrantholders
 of the outstanding Warrants receive, subject to any required stock exchange or regulatory
 approval, the rights or warrants referred to in Section 4.1(a)(iii), Section 4.1(b) or the
 shares, rights, options, warrants, evidences of indebtedness or assets referred to in Section
 4.1(c), as the case may be, in such kind and number as they would have received if they had
 been holders of Common Shares on the applicable record date or effective date, as the case
 may be, by virtue of their outstanding Warrant having then been exercised into Common Shares
 at the Exercise Price in effect on the applicable record date or effective date, as the case
 may be;
-
29
-
(g)
the
 adjustments provided for in this Section 4.1 are cumulative, and shall, in the case of adjustments
 to the Exercise Price be computed to the nearest whole cent and shall apply to successive
 subdivisions, re-divisions, reductions, combinations, consolidations, distributions, issues
 or other events resulting in any adjustment under the provisions of this Section 4.1, provided
 that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, no adjustment of the Exercise
 Price shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at
 least 1% in the Exercise Price then in effect; provided, however, that any adjustments which
 by reason of this Section 4.1(g) are not required to be made shall be carried forward and
 taken into account in any subsequent adjustment; and
(h)
after
 any adjustment pursuant to this Section 4.1, the term “
Common Shares
”
 where used in this Indenture shall be interpreted to mean securities of any class or classes
 which, as a result of such adjustment and all prior adjustments pursuant to this Section
 4.1, the Registered Warrantholder is entitled to receive upon the exercise of his Warrant,
 and the number of Warrant Shares indicated by any exercise made pursuant to a Warrant shall
 be interpreted to mean the number of Warrant Shares or other property or securities a Registered
 Warrantholder is entitled to receive, as a result of such adjustment and all prior adjustments
 pursuant to this Section 4.1, upon the full exercise of a Warrant.
Section
4.2 Entitlement to Warrant Shares on Exercise of Warrant.
All
Common Shares or shares of any class or other securities, which a Registered Warrantholder is at the time in question entitled to receive
on the exercise of its Warrant, whether or not as a result of adjustments made pursuant to this Article 4, shall, for the purposes of
the interpretation of this Indenture, be deemed to be Warrant Shares which such Registered Warrantholder is entitled to acquire pursuant
to such Warrant.
Section
4.3 No Adjustment for Certain Transactions.
Notwithstanding
anything in this Article 4, no adjustment shall be made in the acquisition rights attached to the Warrants if the issue of Common Shares
is being made pursuant to this Indenture or in connection with (a) any share incentive plan or restricted share plan or share purchase
plan in force from time to time for directors, officers, employees, consultants or other service providers of the Corporation; or (b)
the satisfaction of existing instruments issued at the date hereof.

-
Section
4.4 Determination by Independent Firm.
In
the event of any question arising with respect to the adjustments provided for in this Article 4 such question shall be conclusively
determined by an independent firm of chartered public accountants other than the Auditors, who shall have access to all necessary records
of the Corporation, and such determination shall be binding upon the Corporation, the Warrant Agent, all holders and all other persons
interested therein.
Section
4.5 Proceedings Prior to any Action Requiring Adjustment.
As
a condition precedent to the taking of any action which would require an adjustment in any of the acquisition rights pursuant to any
of the Warrants, including the number of Warrant Shares which are to be received upon the exercise thereof, the Corporation shall take
any action which may, in the opinion of Counsel, be necessary in order that the Corporation has unissued and reserved in its authorized
capital and may validly and legally issue as fully paid and non-assessable all the Warrant Shares which the holders of such Warrants
are entitled to receive on the full exercise thereof in accordance with the provisions hereof.
Section
4.6 Certificate of Adjustment.
The
Corporation shall from time to time immediately after the occurrence of any event which requires an adjustment or readjustment as provided
in Section 4.1, deliver a certificate of the Corporation to the Warrant Agent specifying the nature of the event requiring the same and
the amount of the adjustment or readjustment necessitated thereby and setting forth in reasonable detail the method of calculation and
the facts upon which such calculation is based, which certificate may be supported by a certificate of the Corporation’s Auditors
verifying such calculation if requested by the Warrant Agent at their discretion. The Warrant Agent shall rely, and shall be protected
in so doing, upon the certificate of the Corporation or of the Corporation’s Auditor and any other document filed by the Corporation
pursuant to this Article 4 for all purposes.
Section
4.7 Notice of Special Matters.
The
Corporation covenants with the Warrant Agent that, so long as any Warrant remains outstanding, it will give notice to the Warrant Agent
and to the Registered Warrantholders of its intention to fix a record date that is prior to the Expiry Date for any matter for which
an adjustment may be required pursuant to Section 4.1 Such notice shall specify the particulars of such event and the record date for
such event, provided that the Corporation shall only be required to specify in the notice such particulars of the event as shall have
been fixed and determined on the date on which the notice is given. The notice shall be given in each case not less than 10 Business
Days days prior to such applicable record date. If notice has been given and the adjustment is not then determinable, the Corporation
shall promptly, after the adjustment is determinable, file with the Warrant Agent a computation of the adjustment and give notice to
the Registered Warrantholders of such adjustment computation.
-
31
-
Section
4.8 No Action after Notice.
The
Corporation covenants with the Warrant Agent that it will not close its transfer books or take any other corporate action which might
deprive the Registered Warrantholder of the opportunity to exercise its right of acquisition pursuant thereto during the period of 14
days after the giving of the certificate or notices set forth in Section 4.6 and Section 4.7.
Section
4.9 Other Action.
If
the Corporation, after the date hereof, shall take any action affecting the Common Shares other than action described in Section 4.1,
which in the reasonable opinion of the directors of the Corporation would materially affect the rights of Registered Warrantholders,
the Exercise Price and/or Exchange Rate, the number of Warrant Shares which may be acquired upon exercise of the Warrants shall be adjusted
in such manner and at such time, by action of the directors, acting reasonably and in good faith, in their sole discretion as they may
determine to be equitable to the Registered Warrantholders in the circumstances, provided that no such adjustment will be made unless
any requisite prior approval of any stock exchange on which the Common Shares are listed for trading has been obtained.
Section
4.10 Protection of Warrant Agent.
The
Warrant Agent shall not:
(a)
at
 any time be under any duty or responsibility to any Registered Warrantholder to determine
 whether any facts exist which may require any adjustment contemplated by Section 4.1, or
 with respect to the nature or extent of any such adjustment when made, or with respect to
 the method employed in making the same;
(b)
be
 accountable with respect to the validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any Warrant
 Shares or of any other securities or property which may at any time be issued or delivered
 upon the exercise of the rights attaching to any Warrant;

be
 responsible for any failure of the Corporation to issue, transfer or deliver Warrant Shares

incur
 any liability or be in any way responsible for the consequences of any breach on the part

Section
4.11 Participation by Warrantholder.
No
adjustments shall be made pursuant to this Article 4 if the Registered Warrantholders are entitled to participate in any event described

 of the Warrants) continue to be or are listed and posted for trading on the TSX-V (or such
 other Canadian stock exchange acceptable to the Corporation), provided that this clause shall
 not be construed as limiting or restricting the Corporation from completing a consolidation,
 amalgamation, arrangement, takeover bid or merger that would result in the Common Shares
 ceasing to be listed and posted for trading on the TSX-V, so long as the holders of Common
 Shares receive securities of an entity which is listed on a stock exchange in Canada, or
 cash, or the holders of the Common shares have approved the transaction in accordance with
 the requirements of applicable corporate and securities laws and the policies of the TSX-V;

of such failure on the part of the Corporation and may itself perform any of the covenants capable of being performed by it but, subject
to Section 9.2, shall be under no obligation to perform said covenants or to notify the Registered Warrantholders of such performance
by it. All sums expended or advanced by the Warrant Agent in so doing shall be repayable as provided in Section 5.3. No such performance,
expenditure or advance by the Warrant Agent shall relieve the Corporation of any default hereunder or of its continuing obligations under
the covenants herein contained.

 subject as hereinafter provided in this Section 7.11 and in Section 7.14, a resolution proposed
 at a meeting of Registered Warrantholders duly convened for that purpose and held in accordance
 with the provisions of this Article 7 at which there are present in person or by proxy Registered

(1)
In
 the exercise of the rights and duties prescribed or conferred by the terms of this Indenture,
 the Warrant Agent shall exercise that degree of care, diligence and skill that a reasonably
 prudent warrant agent would exercise in comparable circumstances. No provision of this Indenture
 shall be construed to relieve the Warrant Agent from liability for its own gross negligent
 action, wilful misconduct, bad faith or fraud under this Indenture.
(2)
The
 obligation of the Warrant Agent to commence or continue any act, action or proceeding for
 the purpose of enforcing any rights of the Warrant Agent or the Registered Warrantholders
 hereunder shall be conditional upon the Registered Warrantholders furnishing, when required
 by notice by the Warrant Agent, sufficient funds to commence or to continue such act, action
 or proceeding and an indemnity reasonably satisfactory to the Warrant Agent to protect and
 to hold harmless the Warrant Agent and its officers, directors, employees and agents, against
 the costs, charges and expenses and liabilities to be incurred thereby and any loss and damage
 it may suffer by reason thereof. None of the provisions contained in this Indenture shall
 require the Warrant Agent to expend or to risk its own funds or otherwise to incur financial
 liability in the performance of any of its duties or in the exercise of any of its rights
 or powers unless indemnified and funded as aforesaid.
(3)
The
 Warrant Agent may, before commencing or at any time during the continuance of any such act,
 action or proceeding, require the Registered Warrantholders, at whose instance it is acting
 to deposit with the Warrant Agent the Warrants Certificates held by them, for which Warrants
 the Warrant Agent shall issue receipts.

 provision of this Indenture that by its terms relieves the Warrant Agent of liability or

 the exercise of its rights and duties hereunder, the Warrant Agent may, if it is acting in
 good faith, rely as to the truth of the statements and the accuracy of the opinions expressed
 in statutory declarations, opinions, reports, written requests, consents, or orders of the
 Corporation, certificates of the Corporation or other evidence furnished to the Warrant Agent
 pursuant to a request of the Warrant Agent, provided that such evidence complies with Applicable
 Legislation and that the Warrant Agent complies with Applicable Legislation and that the
 Warrant Agent examines the same and determines that such evidence complies with the applicable
 requirements of this Indenture.
(3)
Whenever
 it is provided in this Indenture or under Applicable Legislation that the Corporation shall
 deposit with the Warrant Agent resolutions, certificates, reports, opinions, requests, orders
 or other documents, it is intended that the truth, accuracy and good faith on the effective
 date thereof and the facts and opinions stated in all such documents so deposited shall,
 in each and every such case, be conditions precedent to the right of the Corporation to have
 the Warrant Agent take the action to be based thereon.
(4)
The
 Warrant Agent may employ or retain such Counsel, accountants, appraisers or other experts
 or advisers as it may reasonably require for the purpose of discharging its duties hereunder

 Warrant Agent may act and rely and shall be protected in acting and relying in good faith
 on the opinion or advice of or information obtained from any Counsel, accountant, appraiser,
 engineer or other expert or adviser, whether retained or employed by the Corporation or by
 the Warrant Agent, in relation to any matter arising in the administration of the agency
 hereof.

listed in Schedule 1 of the Bank Act (Canada) (“Approved Bank”). All amounts held by the Warrant Agent pursuant to this Agreement
shall be held by the Warrant Agent for the Corporation and the delivery of the funds to the Warrant Agent shall not give rise to a debtor-creditor
or other similar relationship. The amounts held by the Warrant Agent pursuant to this Agreement are at the sole risk of the Corporation
and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Warrant Agent shall have no responsibility or liability for any diminution
of the funds which may result from any deposit made with an Approved Bank pursuant to this section, including any losses resulting from
a default by the Approved Bank or other credit losses (whether or not resulting from such a default). The parties hereto acknowledge

 Parties’ duties, or any other services that Warrant Agent may provide in connection
 with or in any way relating to this Indenture. The Corporation agrees that its liability
 hereunder shall be absolute and unconditional regardless of the correctness of any representations
 of any third parties and regardless of any liability of third parties to the Indemnified
 Parties, and shall accrue and become enforceable without prior demand or any other precedent
 action or proceeding; provided that the Corporation shall not be required to indemnify the
 Indemnified Parties in the event of the gross negligence or wilful misconduct of the Warrant
 Agent, and this provision shall survive the resignation or removal of the Warrant Agent or
 the termination or discharge of this Indenture; and

10.11 Rights of Rescission and Withdrawal for Holders
Should
a holder of Warrants exercise any legal, statutory, contractual or other right of withdrawal or rescission that may be available to it,
and the holder’s funds which were paid on exercise have already been released to the Corporation by the Warrant Agent, the Warrant
Agent shall not be responsible for ensuring the exercise is cancelled and a refund is paid back to the holder. In such cases, the holder
shall seek a refund directly from the Corporation and subsequently, the Corporation, upon surrender to the Corporation or the Warrant
Agent of any underlying Warrant Shares or other securities that may have been issued, or such other procedure as agreed to by the parties
hereto, shall instruct the Warrant Agent in writing, to cancel the exercise transaction and any such underlying Warrant Shares or other
securities on the register, which may have already been issued upon the Warrant exercise. In the event that any payment is received from
the Corporation by virtue of the holder being a shareholder for such Warrants that were subsequently rescinded, such payment must be
returned to the Corporation by such holder. The Warrant Agent shall not be under any duty or obligation to take any steps to ensure or
enforce the return of the funds pursuant to this section, nor shall the Warrant Agent be in any other way responsible in the event that
any payment is not delivered or received pursuant to this section. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Corporation provides
the refund to the Warrant Agent for distribution to the holder, the Warrant Agent shall return such funds to the holder as soon as reasonably
practicable, and in so doing, the Warrant Agent shall incur no liability with respect to the delivery or non-delivery of any such funds.

(b)
surrendering this warrant certificate (the “

Common Shares will be issued upon exercise of any Warrant.
This
Warrant Certificate evidences Warrants of the Corporation issued or issuable under the provisions of a warrant indenture (which indenture

Nothing
contained in this Warrant Certificate, the Warrant Indenture or elsewhere shall be construed as conferring upon the holder hereof any
right or interest whatsoever as a holder of Common Shares or any other right or interest except as herein and in the Warrant Indenture
expressly provided. In the event of any discrepancy between anything contained in this Warrant Certificate and the terms and conditions
of the Warrant Indenture, the terms and conditions of the Warrant Indenture shall govern.

Vancouver, British Columbia or such other registrar as the Corporation, with the approval of the Warrant Agent, may appoint at such other
place or places, if any, as may be designated, upon surrender of this Warrant Certificate to the Warrant Agent or other registrar accompanied
by a written instrument of transfer in form and execution satisfactory to the Warrant Agent or other registrar and upon compliance with
the conditions prescribed in the Warrant Indenture and with such reasonable requirements as the Warrant Agent or other registrar may
prescribe and upon the transfer being duly noted thereon by the Warrant Agent or other registrar. Time is of the essence hereof.
This
Warrant Certificate will not be valid for any purpose until it has been countersigned by or on behalf of the Warrant Agent from time
to time under the Warrant Indenture.

Dear
Sirs:
We

of the Corporation (“Warrants”), issued under the warrant indenture dated as of November, 17, 2025 between the Corporation

We
hereby confirm that:
(a)
we
 are an “accredited investor” (satisfying one or more of the criteria set forth
 in Rule 501 (a) of Regulation D under the United States Securities Act of 1933 (the “U.S.
 Securities Act”));
(b)
we
 are purchasing the Common Shares for our own account;
(c)
we
 have such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters that we are capable
 of evaluating the merits and risks of purchasing the Common Shares;
(d)
we

 intention of offering or selling any of the Common Shares, except (A) to the Corporation,

 (C) in accordance with Rule 144 under the U.S. Securities Act, if applicable, and in compliance

(f)
we
 acknowledge that we are not purchasing the Common Shares as a result of any “general
 solicitation” or “general advertising” (as such terms are used in Regulation
 D under the U.S. Securities Act), including advertisements, articles, notices or other communications
 published in any newspaper, magazine or similar media or the internet or broadcast over radio,
 television, or the internet, or any seminar or meeting whose attendees have been invited
 by general solicitation or general advertising.
We
understand that the Common Shares are being offered in a transaction not involving any public offering within the United States within
the meaning of the U.S. Securities Act and that the Common Shares have not been and will not be registered under the U.S. Securities
Act. We further understand that any Common Shares acquired by us will be in the form of definitive physical certificates and that such
certificates will bear a legend reflecting the fact that we will not offer, sell or otherwise transfer any of the Common Shares, directly
or indirectly, unless (i) the sale is to the Corporation; (ii) the sale is made outside the United States in compliance with the requirements
of Rule 904 of Regulation S under the U.S. Securities Act; or (iii) the sale is made (A) pursuant to an exemption from registration under

(B) pursuant to another transaction that does not require registration under the U.S. Securities Act or applicable state securities laws,
and in the case of each of (iii)(A) and (B), the purchaser meets the definition of “accredited investor” and the seller has
