performance metrics and will not include consideration of Executive’s individual performance (“Severance Bonus”). Any Severance Bonus paid pursuant to this provision shall be paid at the same time and in the same manner as other employees under the same bonus plan are paid; and
iii.
If Executive was participating in any Company group health plan immediately prior to the Termination Date and elects COBRA health continuation, then Company shall pay to Executive a monthly cash payment for six (6) months or Executive’s COBRA health continuation period, whichever ends earlier, in an amount equal to the monthly employer contribution that Company would have made to provide health insurance to Executive if Executive had remained employed by Company.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, Executive is not entitled to any Severance Amount if Executive breaches the Confidentiality Agreement, or the confidentiality provisions of this Agreement.
​
5.
Section 280G.
​
a.
In the event that it shall be determined that, for any taxable year, Executive would be subject to an excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code or other substitute or similar tax assessment (“Excise Tax”) as a result of any payment (including, without limitation, any acceleration of vesting of any equity or equity-based awards, severance payments or any payments made pursuant to any benefit plan of Company applicable to Executive individually or generally to employees of Company) or distribution to or for the benefit of Executive from Company Group (“Payment”), Company will pay, or cause to be paid, to or on behalf of Executive an additional amount (“Gross-Up Payment”). The Gross-Up Payment will be an amount such that the net amount that Executive retains, after deduction of (i) the Excise Tax on the Payments, (ii) any federal, state, and local income tax and the Excise Tax upon the Gross-Up Payment, and (iii) any interest, penalties, or additions to tax payable by Executive with respect thereto, will be equal to the total present value (determined under Section 280G(d)(4) of the Code) of the Payments at the time such Payments are to be made, as determined by Company in good faith. The Gross-Up Payments are subject to tax withholding, and all or a portion may be withheld and paid over to the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) or any other applicable taxing authority for Executive’s benefit at the time when the Excise Tax is required to be withheld from any Payment to Executive.
​
b.
Subject to the provisions of this Section 5(b), all determinations required to be made under this Section 5, including whether and when a Gross-Up Payment is required and the amount of such Gross-Up Payment and the assumptions to be utilized in arriving at such determination, shall be made by a nationally recognized certified accounting firm designated jointly by Company and Executive (“Consultant”); provided, however, if Company and Executive are unable to designate jointly the accounting firm, then the firm shall be the accounting firm used by Company at the time of the transaction giving rise to the Excise Tax. The Consultant shall provide detailed supporting calculations to the Parties within 20 business days following the consummation of a transaction or series of transactions to which Section 280G of the
​
9655 Maroon Circle, Englewood, CO 80112 | Phone: (800) 495-6670 | Fax: (800) 495-6695 | Zynex.com
​
‌
​
Code applies and within 20 business days following Executive’s receipt of any other Payment (provided, that no additional report shall be provided for each payment of COBRA premiums, unless the cost of such premiums changes). All fees and expenses of the Consultant shall be borne solely by Company. For purposes of making the calculations required by this Section 5, the Consultant may make reasonable assumptions and approximations concerning applicable taxes and may rely on reasonable, good-faith interpretations concerning the application of Sections 280G and 4999 of the Code. As a result of the uncertainty in the application of Section 4999 of the Code at the time of the initial determination by the Consultant under this Agreement, it is possible that Gross-Up Payments which will not have been made by Company should have been made (“Underpayment”), consistent with the calculations required to be made under this Agreement. If Company exhausts its remedies pursuant to Section 5(c) and Executive thereafter is required to make a payment of any Excise Tax, the Consultant shall determine the amount of the Underpayment that has occurred and any such Underpayment plus any applicable interest or penalties, and such amount shall be paid within ten (10) calendar days of such determination by Company to the IRS or any other applicable taxing authority for Executive’s benefit.
​
c.
Executive shall notify Company in writing of any claim by the IRS that, if successful, would require the payment by Company of the Gross-Up Payment. Such notification shall be given as soon as practicable but no later than 10 business days after Executive is informed in writing of such claim and shall apprise Company of the nature of such claim and the date on which such claim is requested to be paid. Executive shall not pay such claim prior to the expiration of the 30-day period following the date on which Executive gives such notice to Company (or such shorter period ending on the date that any payment of taxes with respect to such claim is due). If Company notifies Executive in writing prior to the expiration of such period that it desires to contest such claim Executive shall:
​
i.
Give Company any information reasonably requested by Company relating to such claim;
ii.
Take such action in connection with contesting such claim as Company shall reasonably request in writing from time to time, including, without limitation, accepting legal representation with respect to such claim by any attorney reasonably selected by Company;
iii.
Cooperate with Company in good faith in order effectively to contest such claim; and
iv.
Permit Company to participate in any proceeding relating to such claim;
​
provided, however, that Company shall bear and pay directly all costs and expenses (including additional interest and penalties) in connection with such contest and shall indemnify and hold Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, for any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest and penalties with respect thereto) imposed as a result of such representation and payment of costs and expenses. Without limitation on the foregoing provisions of this Section 5(c), Company shall control all proceedings taken in connection with such contest and, at its sole option, may pursue or forgo any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings, and conferences with the taxing authority in respect of such claim and may, at its sole option, either direct Executive to pay the tax claimed and sue for a refund or contest the claim in any permissible manner, and Executive agrees to prosecute such contest to a determination before any administrative tribunal, in a court of initial jurisdiction and in one or more appellate courts, as Company shall determine; provided further, that if Company directs Executive to pay such claim and sue for a refund, Company shall advance the amount of such payment to Executive on an interest-free basis and shall indemnify and hold Executive harmless, on an after-tax basis, from any Excise Tax or income tax (including interest or penalties with respect thereto) imposed with respect to such advance or with respect to any imputed income with respect to such advance; and provided further, that any extension of statute of limitations relating to payment of taxes for Executive’s taxable year with respect to which such contested amount is claimed to be due is limited solely to such contested amount. Furthermore,
​

​
‌
​
Company’s control of the contest shall be limited to issues with respect to which a Gross-Up Payment would be payable under this Agreement and Executive shall be entitled to settle or contest, as the case may be, any other issue raised by the IRS or any other taxing authority.
​
d.
If, after the receipt by Executive of an amount advanced by Company pursuant to Section 5(b) or Section 5(c), Executive becomes entitled to receive, and receives, any refund with respect to such claim, Executive shall promptly pay to Company the amount of such refund (together with any interest paid or credited thereon after taxes applicable thereto).
​
e.
If it is established pursuant to a final determination of a court or an IRS proceeding that the Excise Tax is less than the amount previously taken into account under this Agreement, Executive will repay Company the portion of the Gross-Up Payment attributable to such reduction plus any interest received by Executive pursuant to such final determination or from the IRS on the amount of such repayment; provided that if any such amount has been paid by Executive as an Excise Tax or other tax, Executive will cooperate with Company in seeking a refund of any tax overpayments, and Executive will not be required to make repayments to Company until the overpaid taxes and interest thereon are refunded to Executive. Executive will make the repayment to Company no later than 30 days after Executive’s receipt of notice of such final determination or, if Executive paid such amounts to the IRS, 30 days after Executive receives a refund of such amounts from the IRS, if later.
​
6.
Section 409A
.
​
a.
Specified Employees
. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if at the time of the Executive’s separation from service within the meaning of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (“Code”), the Company determines that the Executive is a “specified employee” within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, then to the extent any payment or benefit that Executive becomes entitled to under this Agreement on account of the Executive’s separation from service would be considered deferred compensation otherwise subject to the 20 percent additional tax imposed pursuant to Section 409A(a) of the Code as a result of the application of Section 409A(a)(2)(B)(i) of the Code, such payment shall not be payable and such benefit shall not be provided until the date that is the earlier of six months and one day after the Executive’s separation from service, or the Executive’s death. If any such delayed cash payment is otherwise payable on an installment basis, the first payment shall include a catch-up payment covering amounts that would otherwise have been paid during the six-month period but for the application of this provision, and the balance of the installments shall be payable in accordance with their original schedule.
​
b.
Reimbursements
. All in-kind benefits provided and expenses eligible for reimbursement under this Agreement shall be provided by Company or incurred by Executive during the time periods set forth in this Agreement. All reimbursements shall be paid as soon as administratively practicable, but in no event shall any reimbursement be paid after the last day of the taxable year following the taxable year in which the expense was incurred. The amount of in-kind benefits provided or reimbursable expenses incurred in one taxable year shall not affect the in-kind benefits to be provided or the expenses eligible for reimbursement in any other taxable year (except for any lifetime or other aggregate limitation applicable to medical expenses). Such right to reimbursement or in-kind benefits is not subject to liquidation or exchange for another benefit. Any payment or benefit paid to Executive hereunder in respect of reimbursement of taxes incurred by Executive shall be paid to Executive no later than the end of the calendar year following the year in which the related taxes are required to be paid.

​
c.
Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation
. To the extent that any payment or benefit described in this Agreement constitutes “non-qualified deferred compensation” under Section 409A of the Code, and to the extent that such payment or benefit is payable upon the Executive’s termination of employment, then such payments or benefits shall be payable only upon the Executive’s “separation from service.” The determination of whether and when a separation from service has occurred shall be made in accordance with the presumptions set forth in Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-1(h).
​
d.
General
. The intent of the Parties is that the payments and benefits provided pursuant to this Agreement shall be exempt from or comply with Section 409A of the Code, and this Agreement shall be administered in accordance with such intent. To the extent that any provision of this Agreement is ambiguous as to its compliance with or exemption from Section 409A of the Code, the provision shall be read in such a manner so that all payments under this Agreement comply with Section 409A of the Code. Each payment pursuant to this Agreement is intended to constitute a separate payment for purposes of Treasury Regulation Section 1.409A-2(b)(2). This Agreement may be amended, as reasonably requested by either party, and as may be necessary to fully comply with Section 409A of the Code and all related rules and regulations to preserve the payments and benefits provided hereunder without additional cost to either Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Company makes no representations or warranties that the payments and benefits provided under this Agreement comply with Section 409A of the Code or do not constitute deferred compensation under Section 409A of the Code, and Company shall not be liable for all or any portion of any taxes, penalties, interest, or other expenses that may be incurred by Executive on account of non-compliance with Section 409A.

​

During the Term and the Restricted Period, Executive shall not in any way, directly or indirectly, induce or attempt to induce any employee, officer, director, agent, independent contractor, supplier, content provider, vendor, or consultant (“Employees or Service Providers”) of the Company to terminate their relationship with the Company. Executive shall not cause, by way of such direct or indirect inducement or attempted inducement, any Employees or Service Providers to negatively alter their relationship with the Company. “Negatively alter” means to do any damage whatsoever, even minor, to the Company, with the term “damage” to be broadly construed.
c.
Restrictive Covenants
.
i.
General Acknowledgement
. Executive acknowledges and agrees that the work and services Executive is to provide under this Agreement are to occur primarily in Colorado, and that Executive meets the salary threshold for a “highly compensated” employee as outlined in Colorado Law, C.R.S. Section 8-2-113(2).
ii.
Proprietary Information and Trade Secrets
. Executive understands, acknowledges, and agrees that Company has valid Confidential Information, proprietary information, and trade secrets, as those terms are referenced or defined in the Confidentiality Agreement, that constitute valuable information not generally known to third parties, that is secret, and that Company makes efforts to keep secret. For purposes of this Section, “Confidential Information” also includes but is not limited to, any and all confidential and/or proprietary knowledge, data or information of Company or its affiliates, trade secrets, inventions, ideas, materials, concepts, processes, formulas, source and object codes, data, programs, other works of authorship, specialized or unique know-how, improvements, discoveries, developments, designs and techniques, research, development, products, marketing and selling, business plans, budgets, financial statements, licenses, prices and costs, suppliers and customers, and the existence of any business discussions, negotiations, or agreements between Company and third parties, and information regarding the skills, qualifications, or compensation of Company’s employees, contractors, and other service providers.
iii.
Importance of Protecting Company’s Trade Secrets
. Executive understands and acknowledges Company’s trade secrets are of great competitive importance and commercial value to Company, and improper use or disclosure of Company’s Confidential Information and trade secrets are likely to result in unfair, damaging, or unlawful competitive activity. Executive’s obligations not to use or disclose trade secrets, standing alone, are insufficient to protect Company’s legitimate business interests because some post-employment activities would, by their nature, be likely to compromise trade secrets (regardless of intent) and cause damage to goodwill and customer relationships in ways that would be difficult if not impossible to detect and

vi.
Equitable Remedies
. Executive acknowledges that a breach or threatened breach of this Section would give rise to irreparable harm to Company, for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy. In the event of a breach or a threatened breach by Executive of any such obligations, Company may, in addition to any other rights and remedies that may be available, seek and obtain equitable relief, including a temporary restraining order, an injunction, specific performance, and any other relief that may be available from a court of competent jurisdiction, without any requirement to post bond or other security.
vii.
Reasonableness of Restrictions
. Executive acknowledges the restrictions contained in this Section are reasonable and necessary to protect Company’s trade secrets, Confidential Information, and other legitimate interests. If any covenant contained in this Section should ever be adjudicated to exceed the time, geographic, product or service, or other limitations permitted by applicable law in any jurisdiction, then any court or arbitrator is expressly empowered to reform such covenant, and such

viii.

. Executive acknowledges that Executive received the restrictive covenants contained in this Agreement prior to accepting Company’s offer of employment.

This Agreement is not an employment agreement between Indemnitee and Company, any of Company’s subsidiaries, or Enterprise. Indemnitee specifically acknowledges that their service to Company, any of Company’s subsidiaries, or Enterprise is at will and Indemnitee may be discharged at any time for any reason, with or without cause, except as may be otherwise provided in any written employment agreement between Indemnitee and Company, any of Company’s subsidiaries, or Enterprise, other applicable formal severance policies duly adopted by the Board or, with respect to service as a director or officer of Company, by Company’s Constituent Documents or the laws of the State of Nevada.

Advancement of Expenses
. Indemnitee may obtain advancement by Company, prior to the final disposition of any Claim by final adjudication to which there are no further rights of appeal, of any Expenses actually and reasonably paid or incurred by Indemnitee in connection with any Claim arising out of an Indemnifiable Event. Indemnitee’s right to such advancement is not subject to the satisfaction of any standard of conduct or the availability of insurance coverage. Without limiting the generality or effect of the foregoing, within ten (10) business days after receipt of any request by Indemnitee, Company shall either, in accordance with such request, (a) pay such Expenses on Indemnitee’s behalf, (b) advance to Indemnitee funds in an amount sufficient to pay such Expenses, or (c) reimburse Indemnitee for such Expenses. In connection with any request for Expense Advances, Indemnitee is not required to provide any documentation or information that would undermine or otherwise jeopardize attorney-client privilege. In connection with any request for Expense Advances, Indemnitee shall execute and deliver to Company an undertaking (which need not reference Indemnitee’s ability to repay the Expense Advances), in the form of
Exhibit A
attached to this Agreement, to repay any amounts paid, advanced, or reimbursed by Company for such Expenses if and to the extent it is ultimately determined, following the final disposition of such Claim, that Indemnitee is not entitled to indemnification by the Company. Indemnitee’s obligation to reimburse Company for Expense Advances will be unsecured and without interest charged.
Indemnification for Expenses in Enforcing Rights
. To the fullest extent allowed under applicable law, Company shall indemnify against, and, if requested by Indemnitee, advance to Indemnitee subject to and in accordance with Section 4 of this Agreement, any Expenses actually and reasonably paid or incurred by Indemnitee in connection with any action or proceeding by Indemnitee for (a) indemnification, reimbursement, or advancement of Expenses by Company under this Agreement, or under any other agreement or provision of the Constituent Documents relating to Claims, or (b) recovery under any directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policies maintained by Company. However, if Indemnitee is ultimately determined not to be entitled to such indemnification or insurance recovery, Indemnitee shall repay to Company all amounts advanced under this Section 5, provided Indemnitee’s obligations to repay such amounts will be unsecured and without interest charged. Company is not required to indemnify or advance funds to Indemnitee, and Indemnitee shall reimburse Company for any such funds paid, if a court of competent jurisdiction determines that such action brought by Indemnitee was frivolous or not made in good faith.
Partial Indemnity
. If Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification by Company under this Agreement for a portion of any Losses in respect of a Claim, but not for the total amount of Losses, Company shall indemnify Indemnitee for the portion of Losses to which Indemnitee is entitled.
Notification and Defense of Claims
.
Notification of Claims
. Indemnitee shall notify Company in writing as soon as practicable of any Claim or potential Claim. Indemnitee shall include in the notice a brief description of the nature and underlying facts of such Claim, based on information available to Indemnitee. Indemnitee’s failure to timely notify Company does not relieve Company of its obligations under this Agreement, unless such failure materially prejudices Company.
Notice to Insurance
. If at the time of the receipt of such notice, Company has directors’ and officers’ liability insurance in effect under which coverage for Claims is potentially available, Company shall give prompt written notice to the applicable insurers in accordance with the procedures set forth in the applicable policies. Following Indemnitee’s request, Company shall provide Indemnitee a copy of such notice to and correspondence between applicable insurers regarding the Claim
.
Defense of Claims
. Company may participate in the defense of any Claim at its own expense and, except as otherwise provided below, Company may assume the defense of the Claim in Company’s sole discretion. After Company provides notice to Indemnitee of such election, Company will not be liable to Indemnitee under this Agreement or otherwise for any Expenses subsequently directly incurred by Indemnitee in connection with Indemnitee’s defense of such Claim other than reasonable costs of investigation or as otherwise provided below. Indemnitee may continue to employ its own legal counsel in such Claim at Indemnitee’s own expense. However, Indemnitee may

retain its own separate counsel (but not more than one law firm plus, if applicable, local counsel in respect of any such Claim) and Company shall bear all Expenses related to such separate counsel if: (i) Company has provided written authorization of Indemnitee’s employment of their own legal counsel at Company’s expense; (ii) Indemnitee has reasonably determined a conflict of interest may exist between Indemnitee and Company in the defense of such Claim; (iii) after a Change in Control, Indemnitee’s employment of its own counsel has been approved by the Independent Counsel; or (iv) Company has not retained counsel to defend such Claim within sixty (60) calendar days of Company’s receipt of notice from Indemnitee
.
Application for Indemnification
. In addition to the notice required under Section 7 of this Agreement, to obtain indemnification pursuant to this Agreement, Indemnitee must submit a written request for indemnification to Company that includes documentation and information reasonably available to Indemnitee and reasonably necessary to determine whether and to what extent Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification following final disposition of the Claim. Company shall indemnify Indemnitee insofar as Company determines Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification in accordance with Section 9 of this Agreement.
Determination of Right to Indemnification
.
Mandatory Indemnification; Indemnification as a Witness
.
If Indemnitee is successful in whole or in part on the merits or otherwise in defense of any Claim or in defense of any issue or matter in the Claim, including dismissal without prejudice, Company shall indemnify Indemnitee against all Losses relating to such Claim in accordance with Section 3 to the fullest extent allowable by law.
If Indemnitee’s involvement in a Claim is to prepare to serve and serve as a witness, and not as a party, Company shall indemnify Indemnitee against all Losses incurred in connection with such preparation and service as a witness to the fullest extent allowable by law
.
Standard of Conduct
. If Section 9(a) of this Agreement does not apply to a finally disposed Claim, any determination that Indemnitee has satisfied an applicable standard of conduct under the laws of the State of Nevada that is a legally required condition to indemnification or that Expense Advances must be repaid to Company (“
Standard of Conduct Determination
”) shall be made as follows:
if a Change in Control has not occurred, (A) by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, even if less than a quorum of the Board, (B) by a committee of Disinterested Directors designated by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, even though less than a quorum, or (C) if there are no such Disinterested Directors or if such Disinterested Directors so direct, by Independent Counsel in a written opinion addressed to the Board, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee; and
if a Change in Control has occurred, (A) if Indemnitee so requests in writing, by a majority vote of the Disinterested Directors, even if less than a quorum of the Board, or (B) by Independent Counsel in a written opinion addressed to the Board, a copy of which shall be delivered to Indemnitee.
Company shall indemnify and hold harmless Indemnitee against and, if requested by Indemnitee, reimburse or advance to Indemnitee, within ten (10) business days of receipt of such request, all Expenses incurred by Indemnitee in cooperating with the person or persons making such Standard of Conduct Determination.
Making the Standard of Conduct Determination
. Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any Standard of Conduct Determination required under Section 9(b) to be made as promptly as practicable. If the person(s)
​
9655 Maroon Circle, Englewood, CO 80112 | Phone: (800) 495-6670 | Fax: (800) 495-6695 | Zynex.com
designated to make the Standard of Conduct Determination under Section 9(b) do not make a determination within 30 days after the later of (A) Company’s receipt of Indemnitee’s written request for indemnification pursuant to Section 8 of this Agreement (“
Notification Date
”) and (B) the selection of an Independent Counsel, if such determination is to be made by Independent Counsel, and then Indemnitee will be deemed to have satisfied the applicable standard of conduct unless an extension is available. Such 30-day period may be extended for a reasonable time, not to exceed an additional 30 days, if the person(s) making such determination in good faith require additional time to obtain or evaluate relevant information. No determination on Indemnitee’s entitlement to indemnification under this Agreement is required prior to the final disposition of any Claim.
Payment of Indemnification
. If, regarding any Losses:
Indemnitee is entitled to indemnification pursuant to
Section 9(a);
no Standard Conduct Determination is legally required as a condition to indemnification under this Agreement; or
Indemnitee has been determined or deemed pursuant to Section 9(b) or Section 9(c) to have satisfied the Standard of Conduct Determination,
then Company shall pay to Indemnitee, within five (5) business days after the later of (A) the Notification Date or (B) the earliest date on which the applicable criteria specified in clauses (i), (ii), or (iii) are satisfied, an amount equal to such Losses.
Independent Counsel Selection for Standard of Conduct Determination
. If a Standard of Conduct Determination is to be made by Independent Counsel, the Board shall select Independent Counsel, and Company shall notify Indemnitee in writing of the identity of Independent Counsel. Indemnitee may, within ten calendar days after receiving written notice of selection, deliver to Company a written objection to such selection specifying with particularity the factual basis of the objection; provided Indemnitee may assert such objection only on the ground that selected counsel does not satisfy the criteria set forth in the definition of “Independent Counsel” in this Agreement. Absent a proper and timely objection, the person or firm selected shall act as Independent Counsel. If such written objection is properly and timely made and substantiated, (i) the selected counsel may not serve as Independent Counsel unless and until such objection is withdrawn or a court of competent jurisdiction has determined that such objection is without merit; and (ii) the Board may select an alternative Independent Counsel in accordance with the provisions of this Section. If applicable, the selection and objection provisions of this Section apply to successive alternative selections. If no Independent Counsel is selected within 20 days after Company gives its initial notice of selection, either Company or Indemnitee may petition the Nevada Court to resolve any objection to the selection of Independent Counsel or to appoint Independent Counsel selected by the Court or such other person as the Court shall designate. Company shall pay all Independent Counsel’s reasonable fees and expenses incurred in connection with Independent Counsel’s determination
.
Presumptions and Defenses.
Indemnitee’s Entitlement to Indemnification
. In making any Standard of Conduct Determination, the person or persons making such determination shall presume that Indemnitee has satisfied the applicable standard of conduct and is entitled to indemnification, and Company shall have the burden of proof to overcome that presumption and establish Indemnitee is not so entitled. Indemnitee may challenge in Nevada Court any Standard of Conduct Determination adverse to Indemnitee. Company’s determination (including a determination by its directors or Independent Counsel) that Indemnitee has not satisfied any applicable standard of conduct may not be used as a defense to any legal proceedings brought by Indemnitee to
​
9655 Maroon Circle, Englewood, CO 80112 | Phone: (800) 495-6670 | Fax: (800) 495-6695 | Zynex.com
secure indemnification or reimbursement or advance payment of Expenses by Company under this Agreement or create a presumption that Indemnitee has not met any applicable standard of conduct.
Reliance as a Safe Harbor
. Without creating any presumption as to a lack of good faith if the following circumstances do not exist, Indemnitee shall be presumed to have acted in good faith and in a manner they reasonably believe to be in or not opposed to Company’s best interests under this Agreement if Indemnitee’s actions or omissions are taken in good faith reliance on Company records, including its financial statements, or on information, opinions, reports, or statements furnished to Indemnitee by Company officers or employees or any of Company’s subsidiaries in the course of their duties, or by Board committees or by any other Person (including legal counsel, accountants, and financial advisors) as to matters Indemnitee reasonably believes are within such other Person’s professional or expert competence and who has been selected with reasonable care by or on behalf of Company. In addition, the knowledge, actions, or omissions of any Company director, officer, agent, or employee will not be imputed to Indemnitee for purposes of determining the right to indemnity under this Agreement.
No Other Presumptions
. The termination of any Claim by judgment, order, settlement (with or without court approval), conviction, or a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, will not create a presumption that Indemnitee did not meet any applicable standard of conduct or have any particular belief, or that indemnification under this Agreement is otherwise not permitted.
Defense to Indemnification and Burden of Proof
. Company may bring as a defense to any action brought by Indemnitee to enforce this Agreement (other than an action to enforce a claim for Losses incurred in defending against a Claim in advance of its final disposition) that applicable law does not permit Company to indemnify Indemnitee for the amount claimed. In connection with any such action or any related Standard of Conduct Determination, Company shall bear the burden of proving such a defense or that Indemnitee did not satisfy the applicable standard of conduct.
Resolution of Claims
. Company acknowledges that a settlement or other disposition short of final judgment may be successful on the merits or otherwise for purposes of Section 9(a)(i) if it permits a party to avoid expense, delay, distraction, disruption, and uncertainty.
Exclusions from Indemnification
. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Company is not obligated to:
indemnify or advance funds to Indemnitee for Expenses or Losses with respect to proceedings initiated by Indemnitee, including any proceedings against Company or its directors, officers, employees, or other indemnitees and not by way of defense, except:
funds owed under proceedings referenced in Section 5 of this Agreement; or
proceedings that Company has joined, or that the Board has consented to initiating
;
indemnify Indemnitee if a final decision by a court of competent jurisdiction determines such indemnification is prohibited by applicable law
;
indemnify or advance funds to Indemnitee for the disgorgement of profits arising from Indemnitee’s purchase or sale of Company securities in violation of Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act, or any similar successor statute
;
indemnify or advance funds to Indemnitee for Indemnitee’s reimbursement to Company of any bonus or other incentive- or equity-based compensation Indemnitee previously received, or payment of any profits Indemnitee realized from the sale of Company securities, as required in each case under the Exchange Act (including any such reimbursements under Section 304 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“
SOX
”) in connection with an accounting
​
9655 Maroon Circle, Englewood, CO 80112 | Phone: (800) 495-6670 | Fax: (800) 495-6695 | Zynex.com
restatement of Company or under any Company clawback policy adopted to comply with Rule 10D-1 under the Exchange Act and applicable stock exchange listing requirements, or payment to Company of profits arising from Indemnitee’s purchase or sale of securities in violation of Section 306 of SOX).
The Parties acknowledge that in certain circumstances, federal law or applicable public policy may prohibit Company from indemnifying its directors and officers under this Agreement or otherwise. Indemnitee understands and acknowledges that Company has undertaken, or may be required in the future to undertake, with the Securities and Exchange Commission to submit a question of indemnification to a court of competent jurisdiction in certain circumstances to determine Company’s right under public policy to indemnify Indemnitee.
Settlement of Claims
. Company is not liable to Indemnitee under this Agreement for amounts paid to settle any Claim effected without Company’s prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld; provided, however, that if a Change in Control has occurred, Company shall indemnify Indemnitee for amounts paid in settlement if Independent Counsel approved the settlement. Company shall not settle any Claim in any manner that would impose Losses on Indemnitee without Indemnitee’s prior written consent.
Duration
. The terms and conditions of this Agreement remain in effect while Indemnitee serves as a director or officer of Company (or at Company’s request as a director, officer, employee, member, trustee, or agent of another Enterprise) and continue during and after such service (i) for so long as Indemnitee may be subject to any possible Claim, including any appeal rights, and (ii) throughout the pendency of any proceeding, including any appeal rights, Indemnitee commences to enforce or interpret their rights under this Agreement
.
Non-Exclusivity
. Indemnitee’s rights under this Agreement are in addition to any other rights Indemnitee may have under the Constituent Documents, the Nevada Business Corporation Act, any other contract, or otherwise (collectively, “
Other Indemnity Provisions
”); provided, however, that (a) to the extent that Indemnitee otherwise would have any greater right to indemnification under any Other Indemnity Provision, Indemnitee will be deemed to have such greater right under this Agreement, and (b) if any change is made to any Other Indemnity Provision that permits any greater right to indemnification than that provided under this Agreement as of the date of this Agreement, Indemnitee will be deemed to have such greater right under this Agreement. Company will not adopt any amendment to any of the Constituent Documents the effect of which would be to deny, diminish, or encumber Indemnitee’s right to indemnification under this Agreement or any Other Indemnity Provision.
Liability Insurance
. During Indemnitee’s service as a director or officer of Company, and after such service for so long as Indemnitee is subject to any pending Claim, Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts (considering the scope and amount of coverage available relative to cost) to maintain in effect policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance providing coverage that is at least substantially comparable in scope and amount to that provided by Company’s current policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance. In all policies of directors’ and officers’ liability insurance maintained by Company, Indemnitee shall be named as an insured in such a manner as to provide Indemnitee the same rights and benefits as are provided to the most favorably insured of Company’s directors, if Indemnitee is a director, or of Company’s officers, if Indemnitee is an officer and not a director by such policy. Upon request, Company will provide to Indemnitee copies of all directors’ and officers’ liability insurance applications, binders, policies, declarations, endorsements, and other related materials.
No Duplicate Payments
. Company is not obligated under this Agreement to make any payment to Indemnitee for any Losses to the extent Indemnitee has otherwise received payment under any insurance policy, the Constituent Documents, Other Indemnity Provisions, or otherwise of the amounts otherwise indemnifiable by Company under this Agreement.
Subrogation
. If Company makes a payment to Indemnitee under this Agreement, Company will be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all Indemnitee’s rights of recovery. Indemnitee shall execute all papers required and shall do everything
​
9655 Maroon Circle, Englewood, CO 80112 | Phone: (800) 495-6670 | Fax: (800) 495-6695 | Zynex.com
that may be necessary to secure such rights, including executing such documents necessary to enable Company to effectively to bring suit to enforce such rights.
Amendments
. Any supplement, modification, or amendment of this Agreement must be executed in writing by both Parties. Any waiver of the provisions of this Agreement must be in writing signed by the Party against whom enforcement is sought, such waiver does not operate as a waiver of any other provision of this Agreement and does not constitute a continuing waiver. A Party’s failure or delay in exercising any right or remedy under this Agreement does not constitute a waiver of such right or remedy, except as specifically provided
in this Agreement.
Binding Effect
. This Agreement is binding on, inures to the benefit of, and is enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors (including any direct or indirect successor by purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise to all or substantially all of Company’s business or assets), assigns, spouses, heirs, and personal and legal representatives. Company shall ensure any successor (whether direct or indirect by purchase, merger, consolidation, or otherwise) to all, substantially all, or a substantial part of the business or assets of Company, by written agreement in form and substances satisfactory to Indemnitee, expressly assumes and agrees to perform this Agreement in the same manner and to the same extent that Company would be required to perform if no such succession had taken place.
Severability
. If all or part of any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, void, or otherwise unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Agreement remain enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law. Upon such determination that any provision is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement in a mutually acceptable manner to effect the Parties’ original intent as closely as possible
.

The Parties irrevocably and unconditionally: (a) agree that any action or proceeding arising out of or in connection with this Agreement shall be brought only in the Nevada Court and not in any other state or federal court in the United States, (b) consent to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Nevada Court for purposes of any action or proceeding arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, and (c) waive, and agree not to plead or make, any claim that the Nevada Court lacks venue or that any such action or proceeding brought in the Nevada Court has been brought in an improper or inconvenient forum.

​

​

” means any compensation that is granted, earned, or vested based wholly or in part upon the attainment of a Financial Reporting Measure.

​
3.
Administration
. This Policy shall be administered by the Board, the Compensation Committee of the Board (the “
Compensation Committee
”), the Audit Committee of the Board (the “
Audit Committee
”) or a special committee comprised of members of the Compensation Committee and Audit Committee. For purposes of this Policy, the body charged with administering this Policy shall be referred to herein as the “
Administrator
.” The Administrator is authorized to interpret and construe this Policy and to make all determinations necessary, appropriate or advisable for the administration of this Policy, in each case, to the extent permitted under the Listing Standards and in compliance with (or pursuant to an exemption from the application of) Section 409A of the Code. All determinations and decisions made by the Administrator pursuant to the provisions of this Policy shall be final, conclusive and binding on all persons, including the Company, its affiliates, its stockholders and Covered Executive Officers, and need not be uniform with respect to each person covered by this Policy.
​
In the administration of this Policy, the Administrator is authorized and directed to consult with the full Board or such other committees of the Board as may be necessary or appropriate as to matters within the scope of such other committee’s responsibility and authority. Subject to any limitation at applicable law, the Administrator may authorize and empower any officer or employee of the Company to take any and all actions necessary or appropriate to carry out the purpose and intent of this Policy (other than with respect to any recovery under this Policy involving such officer or employee). Any action or inaction by the Administrator with respect to a Covered Executive Officer under this Policy in no way limits the Administrator’s decision to act or not to act with respect to any other Covered Executive Officer under this Policy or under any similar policy, agreement or arrangement, nor shall any such action or inaction serve as a waiver of any rights the Company may have against any Covered Executive Officer other than as set forth in this Policy.
​
4.
Application of this Policy
. This Policy applies to all Incentive-Based Compensation received by a person: (a) after beginning service as a Covered Executive Officer; (b) who served as a Covered Executive Officer at any time during the performance period for such Incentive-Based Compensation; (c) while the Company had a listed class of securities on a national securities exchange; and (d) during the Applicable Period. For the avoidance of doubt, Incentive-Based Compensation that is subject to both a Financial Reporting Measure vesting condition and a service-based vesting condition shall be considered received
​
9655 Maroon Circle, Englewood, CO 80112 | Phone: (800) 495-6670 | Fax: (800) 495-6695 | Zynex.com
when the relevant Financial Reporting Measure is achieved, even if the Incentive-Based Compensation continues to be subject to the service-based vesting condition.
​
5.
Recovery Erroneously Awarded Compensation
. In the event of an Accounting Restatement, the Company must recover Erroneously Awarded Compensation reasonably promptly, in amounts determined pursuant to this Policy. The Company’s obligation to recover Erroneously Awarded Compensation is not dependent on the filing of restated financial statements. Recovery under this Policy with respect to a Covered Executive Officer shall not require the finding of any misconduct by such Covered Executive Officer or such Covered Executive Officer being found responsible for the accounting error leading to an Accounting Restatement. In the event of an Accounting Restatement, the method for recouping Erroneously Awarded Compensation shall be determined by the Administrator in its sole and absolute discretion, to the extent permitted under the Listing Standards and incompliance with (or pursuant to an exemption from the application of) Section 409A of the Code.
​
Recovery may include, without limitation, (i) reimbursement of all or a portion of any incentive compensation award, (ii) cancellation of incentive compensation awards and (iii) any other method authorized by applicable law or contract.
​
The Company is authorized and directed pursuant to this Policy to recover Erroneously Awarded Compensation in compliance with this Policy unless the Compensation Committee has determined that recovery would be impracticable solely for the following limited reasons, and subject to the following procedural and disclosure requirements:
​
a.
The direct expenses paid to a third party to assist in enforcing this Policy would exceed the amount to be recovered. Before reaching such conclusion, the Administrator must make a reasonable attempt to recover such Erroneously Awarded Compensation, document such reasonable attempt(s) to recover, and provide that documentation to Nasdaq;
​
b.
Recovery would violate home country law where that law was adopted prior to November 28, 2022. Before reaching such conclusion, the Administrator must obtain an opinion of home country counsel, acceptable to Nasdaq, that recovery would result in such a violation, and must provide such opinion to Nasdaq; or
​
c.
Recovery would likely cause an otherwise tax-qualified retirement plan, under which benefits are broadly available to employees of the Company, to fail to meet the requirements of Section 401(a)(13) or Section 411(a)of the Code.
​
6.
Prohibition on Indemnification and Insurance Reimbursement
. The Company is prohibited from indemnifying any Covered Executive Officer against the loss of any Erroneously Awarded Compensation. Further, the Company is prohibited from paying or reimbursing a Covered Executive Officer for the cost of purchasing insurance to cover any such loss. The Company is also prohibited from entering into any agreement or arrangement whereby this Policy would not apply or fail to be enforced against a Covered Executive Officer.
​
7.
Required Policy-Related Disclosure and Filings
. The Company shall file all disclosures with respect to this Policy in accordance with the requirements of the federal securities laws, including disclosures required by U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings. A copy of this Policy and any amendments hereto shall be posted on the Company’s website and filed as an exhibit to the Company’s annual report on Form 10-K.
​
8.
Acknowledgement
. Each Covered Executive Officer shall sign and return to the Company within thirty (30)calendar days following the later of (i) the effective date of this Policy set forth below or (ii) the date such individual becomes a Covered Executive Officer, the Acknowledgement Form attached hereto as Exhibit A, pursuant to which the Covered Executive Officer agrees to be bound by, and to comply with, the terms and conditions of this Policy.
​

B.
Together with the Employment Agreement between Employee and Zynex into which this Agreement is incorporated, to protect this information and ensure that it remains secure, Zynex requires all employees to agree to certain guidelines regarding confidentiality and ownership of intellectual property.

C.
This Agreement also helps to prevent the improper use of Zynex’s Confidential Information and Trade Secrets, which ensures the continued success of the business.
​
In consideration of Employee’s employment with Zynex, the Parties agree as follows:
​
1.
Confidentiality

Employee understands and acknowledges that during Employee’s employment with Zynex, Employee will create, have access to, and learn about confidential, secret, and proprietary documents, materials, data, and other information in any form relating to Zynex and its businesses (“Confidential Information”). Employee further understands and acknowledges that Confidential Information is of great importance and commercial value to Zynex, and that any improper use or disclosure of Confidential Information will cause Zynex irreparable harm.
​

Notice of DTSA Immunity
. Under the Economic Espionage Act of 1996, as amended by the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016 (“DTSA”), an individual will not be held criminally or civilly liable under any federal or state trade secret law for any disclosure of a trade secret that is made: (i) in confidence to a federal, state, or local government official, either directly or indirectly, or to an attorney and solely for the purpose of reporting or investigating a suspected violation of law; or (ii) in a complaint or other document that is filed under seal in a lawsuit or other proceeding. If an individual files a lawsuit for retaliation by an employer for reporting a suspected violation of law, the individual may disclose trade secrets to their attorney and use the trade secret information in the court proceeding, if the individual files any document containing the trade secret under seal and does not disclose the trade secret, except pursuant to court order.
​

​
c.
Ownership
. Employee acknowledges and agrees that all Work Product is “work made for hire” as defined in 17 U.S.C. § 101 and will be Zynex’s sole and exclusive property and proprietary information. If for any reason the Work Product is not considered “work made for hire,” Employee hereby irrevocably assigns to Zynex all Proprietary Rights in the Work Product effective immediately upon its creation. Employee acknowledges and agrees that Employee does not retain any rights to use the Work Product, that all Proprietary Rights are the sole and exclusive property of Zynex, and shall not challenge Zynex’s ownership of the Work Product. Employee further irrevocably waives, to the extent permitted by applicable law, any claims Employee may have to rights of paternity, integrity, disclosure, withdrawal, and any other moral rights with respect to Work Product and Intellectual Property Rights.
​
d.

. If for any reason the Work Product or Proprietary Rights are not assignable or Employee retains any right, title or interest in and to any Work Product or Proprietary Rights, Employee (i) unconditionally and irrevocably waives the enforcement of such rights and all claims and causes of action of any kind against Zynex with respect to such rights; (ii) agrees, at Zynex’s request and expense, to consent to and join in any action to enforce such rights; and (iii) grants to Zynex for no additional consideration an exclusive, worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty free, transferable, and sublicensable license to use, reproduce, disclose, distribute, display, perform, modify, develop, make, sell, offer, import, and otherwise use and exploit all or any part of the Work Product and any materials incorporated into the Work Product.

​
e.
Further Assistance

At Zynex’s request and expense, both during and after Employee’s employment, Employee shall reasonably cooperate with Zynex to perform such acts and execute, acknowledge, and deliver such documents as Zynex reasonably deems necessary or advisable to accomplish the purposes of this Agreement, including obtaining, sustaining, and enforcing Zynex Proprietary Rights in the Work Product. Employee hereby irrevocably appoints Zynex and its officers and agents as Employee’s true and lawful agent and attorney in fact, with full power of substitution and delegation, with the right but not the obligation to execute, acknowledge, and deliver such documents as Zynex reasonably deems necessary or advisable to obtain, sustain, and enforce Zynex’s Proprietary Rights in the Work Product, including filing registrations or applications with the U.S. Copyright or Patent and Trademark Offices, on Employee’s behalf, with the same legal force and effect as if Employee so acted or signed, if Employee does not promptly coordinate with Zynex’s request. The power of attorney is coupled with an interest and shall not be impacted by Employee’s subsequent incapacity.
​
3.
Fiduciary Duties and Conflicts of Interest
.
While employed by Zynex, Employee shall not take any action that directly or indirectly harms or interferes with Zynex’s interests, including working as an employee or independent Employee for any person or entity in competition with Zynex, performing the same or similar kinds of work for any other person or entity as those performed for Zynex, or entering any arrangement with any person or entity to benefit from work performed by Zynex. Employee acknowledges that because
​
9655 Maroon Circle, Englewood, CO 80112 | Phone: (800) 495-6670 | Fax: (800) 495-6695 | Zynex.com
of the special nature of the employment relationship between Zynex and Employee, Employee has fiduciary duties to Zynex, including fiduciary duties of the highest loyalty, fidelity, and allegiance to act in the best interests of Zynex, to make full disclosure to Zynex of all information pertaining to its business and interests, and to do no act that would injure Zynex’s business, interest, or reputation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this paragraph shall impose a duty on Employee in addition to, or beyond those already required by law.
​
4.
Return of Property and Confidential Information
.
Employees are entrusted during their employment with property that belongs to Zynex and that has value. Upon termination of Employee’s employment, or upon Zynex’s request, Employee shall return to Zynex any Zynex property, including electronic equipment, electronic devices, demo devices, keys, access cards, credit cards, documents, files, copies, materials, PHI, Confidential Information, and Work Product, that are in Employee’s possession or control. Only after Employee has returned all Zynex property to Zynex, Employee shall permanently delete any copies of documents and materials that remain in Employee’s possession or control. Zynex may withhold Employee’s final paycheck for up to ten (10) days to audit the return of all property and to determine the value of any property not returned. If Zynex determines it may deduct from Employee’s final paycheck, within ten (10) days after Employee’s employment terminates, Zynex will provide Employee with notice that Zynex is deducting from Employee’s wages for the value of property that Employee failed to return to Zynex. The notice will include a written accounting specifying the specific property Employee failed to return, the replacement value of the property, and, to the extent known, when property was provided to Employee and when Zynex believes Employee should have returned the property to Zynex. If, after Zynex it provides notice and makes a deduction, Employee returns the property within fourteen (14) days after Zynex provides notice, Zynex will pay Employee the amount of the deduction within fourteen (14) days after Employee returns the property. Employee acknowledges that Employee is obligated to repay Zynex for the value of property not returned at termination. Employee shall comply with the terms and conditions of the return of demo devices or other property governed by any agreements Employee signed.
​
5.
Acknowledgments

Employee acknowledges and agrees that the services to be rendered by Employee to Zynex are of a special and unique character, that Employee will obtain knowledge and skill relevant to Zynex’s industry, business methods, and marketing strategies, and that the terms and conditions of this Agreement are reasonable under these circumstances. Employee further acknowledges that Employee’s compensation reflects, in part, Employee’s obligations and Zynex’s rights under this Agreement, that Employee has no expectation of any additional compensation, royalties, or other payment, that Employee will not be subject to undue hardship due to Employee’s full compliance with this Agreement or Zynex’s enforcement of this Agreement. By executing this Agreement, Employee represents that Employee has been given the opportunity to fully review and understand the terms of this Agreement, and that Employee fully understands and freely and voluntarily signs this Agreement.
​
6.
At-Will Employment
.
This Agreement is not a contract for employment and is not a commitment by Zynex or Employee to continue an employment relationship for a certain period.
EMPLOYEE’S EMPLOYMENT IS AT-WILL, AND ZYNEX OR EMPLOYEE MAY TERMINATE EMPLOYEE’S EMPLOYMENT AT ANY TIME AND FOR ANY REASON, WITH OR WITHOUT NOTICE.
​
7.
Remedies

In the event of Employee’s breach or threatened breach of this Agreement, Zynex may seek, in addition to other available remedies, a temporary or permanent injunction, or other equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction, without the necessity of showing actual damages or that monetary
​
9655 Maroon Circle, Englewood, CO 80112 | Phone: (800) 495-6670 | Fax: (800) 495-6695 | Zynex.com
damages would not afford an adequate remedy, and without posting bond or other security. This relief is in addition to other available legal remedies.

​
8.
Assignment

​
10.
Entire Agreement
.
This Agreement, together with other documents, policies, and procedures incorporated by reference into this Agreement, is the entire agreement with respect to its subject matter, and supersedes all prior written or verbal understandings and agreements with respect to the subject matter.
​
11.
Modification and Waiver
.
The Agreement may only be modified in writing signed by Employee and approved by a duly authorized officer of Zynex other than Employee. Zynex’s or Employee’s waiver of any breach of this Agreement does not constitute a waiver of any other term or condition of this Agreement, and either Party’s failure of or delay in exercising any right, power, or privilege under this Agreement does not constitute a waiver of such right, power, or privilege.
​
12.
Severability
.
All provisions of this Agreement will be applicable only to the extent that they do not violate any applicable law and are intended to be limited to the extent necessary to not render this Agreement invalid, illegal, or unenforceable. If any part of this Agreement is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. To the extent permitted by law, the invalid or unenforceable provision may be modified to carry out the intent and agreement of Zynex and Employee. As modified, the Agreement will be binding on and enforceable against Zynex and Employee.

The Parties have executed this Agreement as of the Effective Date.

​
3.

5.
Waiver of Class Action and Representative Action Claims
. Except for representative claims that cannot be waived under applicable law and are therefore excluded from this Agreement (“Excluded Claims”), Employee and Zynex expressly intend and agree that: (a) class action and representative action procedures are hereby waived and shall not be asserted, nor will they apply, in any arbitration pursuant to this Agreement; (b) each will not assert class action or representative action claims against the other in arbitration, court, or any other forum; (c) each shall only submit their own, individual claims in arbitration and shall not bring claims against the other in any representative capacity on behalf of any other individual including, but not limited to, a representative action on behalf of other under the Private Attorney General Act of 2004 (PAGA); and (d) any claims by Employee will not be joined, consolidated, or heard together with claims of any other current or former employee of Zynex.

​
6.
Waiver of Trial by Jury
. Both Parties understand and fully agree that by entering into this Agreement, they are giving up certain rights otherwise afforded to them by civil court actions, including but not limited to, their constitutional right to have a trial by jury, and are giving up their normal rights of appeal following the rendering of a decision except as state law provides for judicial review of arbitration proceedings.

punitive damages.

​
11.
Hearing and Decision
. The Arbitrator will conduct and preside over an arbitration hearing of reasonable length, to be determined by the Arbitrator. The Arbitrator will provide the Parties with a written decision explaining their findings and conclusions. The Arbitrator’s decision will be final and binding upon the Parties. The arbitration will be conducted on a confidential basis, and the Parties shall not disclose the decision, evidence, or award beyond the arbitration proceeding except as necessary for tax purposes, as necessary for compliance with applicable law, or as otherwise mutually agreed in writing by both Parties.
​
12.
Motions
. The Arbitrator will have jurisdiction to hear and rule on prehearing disputes and is authorized to hold prehearing conferences by telephone or in person as the Arbitrator deems necessary. The Arbitrator will have the authority to set deadlines for completion of discovery and for filing motions for summary judgment, and to set briefing schedules for any motions. The Arbitrator will have the authority to adjudicate any cause of action, or the entire claim, pursuant to a motion for summary adjudication and/or summary judgment, and, in deciding such motions, will apply the substantive law applicable to the cause of action.
​
13.
Compelling Arbitration and Enforcing Awards
. Either Party may bring an action in court to compel arbitration under this Agreement or to otherwise determine the arbitrability of claims under this Agreement, and to confirm, vacate, or enforce an arbitration award. Each Party shall bear its own attorney fees and costs and other expenses of such action.
​
14.
Arbitration Fees and Costs
. Zynex shall pay the arbitrator’s fees and expenses. Each Party shall pay its own costs and attorneys’ fees, if any. However, if any Party prevails on a statutory claim that affords the prevailing party attorneys’ fees and costs, or if there is a written agreement providing for attorneys’ fees and costs, the Arbitrator may award reasonable attorneys’ fees and costs to the prevailing party. The Arbitrator will resolve any dispute as to the reasonableness of any fee or cost.
​
15.
