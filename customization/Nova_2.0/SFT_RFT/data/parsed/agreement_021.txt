Section 2.3
Execution and Authentication
.
One Officer shall sign the Securities for the Company by manual, facsimile or electronic signature. If an Officer whose signature is on a
Security no longer holds that office at the time the Security is authenticated, the Security shall nevertheless be valid.
A Security
shall not be valid until authenticated by the manual signature of the Trustee or an authenticating agent. The signature shall be conclusive evidence that the Security has been authenticated under this Indenture.
The Trustee shall at any time, and from time to time, authenticate Securities for original issue in the principal amount provided in the Board
Resolution, supplemental indenture hereto or Officer’s Certificate, upon receipt by the Trustee of a Company Order. Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication.
The aggregate principal amount of Securities of any Series outstanding at any time may not exceed any limit upon the maximum principal amount
for such Series set forth in the Board Resolution, supplemental indenture hereto or Officer’s Certificate delivered pursuant to
Section
2.2
, except as provided in
Section
2.8
.
Prior to the issuance of Securities of any Series, the Trustee shall have received and (subject to
Section
7.2
)
shall be fully protected in relying on: (1) the Board Resolution, supplemental indenture hereto or Officer’s Certificate establishing the form of the Securities of that Series or of Securities within that Series and the terms of the
Securities of that Series or of Securities within that Series, (2) an Officer’s Certificate complying with
Sections
10.4
and
10.5
, and (3) an Opinion of Counsel complying with
Sections
10.4
and
10.5
.
The Trustee shall have the right to decline to authenticate and deliver any
Securities of such Series: (1) if the Trustee, being advised by counsel, determines that such action may not be taken lawfully or (2) if the Trustee in good faith determines that such action may expose the Trustee to personal liability.
The Trustee may appoint an authenticating agent acceptable to the Company to authenticate Securities. An authenticating agent may
authenticate Securities whenever the Trustee may do so. Each reference in this Indenture to authentication by the Trustee includes authentication by such agent. An authenticating agent has the same rights as an Agent to deal with the Company or an
Affiliate.
12
Section 2.4
Registrar, Paying Agent and Service Agent
.
The Company shall maintain, with respect to each Series of Securities, at the place or places specified with respect to such Series pursuant
to
Section
2.2
, an office or agency where Securities of such Series may be presented or surrendered for payment (“
Paying Agent
”), where Securities of such Series may be surrendered for registration of
transfer or exchange (“
Registrar
”) and where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Securities of such Series and this Indenture may be delivered (“
Service Agent
”). The Registrar shall keep
a register with respect to each Series of Securities and to their transfer and exchange. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the name and address, and any change in the name or address, of each Registrar, Paying Agent or
Service Agent. If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required Registrar, Paying Agent or Service Agent or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the name and address thereof, such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands
may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, and the Company hereby appoints the Trustee as its agent to receive all such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands;
provided
,
however
, that any appointment of
the Trustee as the Service Agent shall exclude the appointment of the Trustee or any office of the Trustee as an agent to receive the service of legal process on the Company.
The Company may also from time to time designate one or more
co-registrars,
additional paying agents
or additional service agents and may from time to time rescind such designations;
provided
,
however
, that no such designation or rescission shall in any manner relieve the Company of its obligations to maintain a Registrar, Paying
Agent and Service Agent in each place so specified pursuant to
Section
2.2
for Securities of any Series for such purposes. The Company will give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any such designation or rescission and
of any change in the name or address of any such
co-registrar,
additional paying agent or additional service agent. The term “Registrar” includes any
co-registrar;
the term “Paying Agent” includes any additional paying agent; and the term “Service Agent” includes any additional service agent. The Company or any of its Affiliates may
serve as Registrar or Paying Agent.
The Company hereby appoints the Trustee the initial Registrar, Paying Agent and Service Agent for
each Series unless another Registrar, Paying Agent or Service Agent, as the case may be, is appointed prior to the time Securities of that Series are first issued. The rights, powers, duties, obligations and actions of each Agent under this
Indenture are several and not joint or joint and several, and the Agents shall only be obliged to perform those duties expressly set out in this Indenture and shall have no implied duties.
Section 2.5
Paying Agent to Hold Money in Trust
.
The Company shall require each Paying Agent other than the Trustee to agree in writing that the Paying Agent will hold in trust, for the
benefit of Holders of any Series of Securities, or the Trustee, all money held by the Paying Agent for the payment of principal of or interest on the Series of Securities, and will notify the Trustee in writing of any default by the Company in
making any such payment. While any such default continues, the Trustee may require a Paying Agent to pay all money held by it to the Trustee. The Company at any time may require a Paying Agent to pay all money held by it to the Trustee. Upon payment
over to the Trustee, the Paying Agent (if other than the Company or a Subsidiary) shall have no further liability for the money. If the
13
Company or a Subsidiary acts as Paying Agent, it shall segregate and hold in a separate trust fund for the benefit of Holders of any Series of Securities all money held by it as Paying Agent.
Upon any bankruptcy, reorganization or similar proceeding with respect to the Company, the Trustee shall serve as Paying Agent for the Securities. For the avoidance of doubt, a Paying Agent and the Trustee shall be held harmless and have no
liability with respect to payments or disbursements (including to the Holders) until they have confirmed receipt of funds sufficient to make the relevant payment. No money held by an Agent needs to be segregated except as is required by law.
Section 2.6
Holder Lists
.
If it is serving as the Registrar, the Trustee shall preserve in as current a form as is reasonably practicable the most recent list available
to it of the names and addresses of Holders of each Series of Securities and shall otherwise comply with TIA § 312(a). If the Trustee is not the Registrar, the Company shall furnish to the Trustee at least ten days before each interest
payment date and at such other times as the Trustee may request in writing a list, in such form and as of such date as the Trustee may reasonably require, of the names and addresses of Holders of each Series of Securities.
Every Holder, by receiving and holding Securities, agrees with the Company and the Trustee that neither the Company nor the Trustee or any
agent of either of them shall be held accountable by reason of the disclosure of any such information as to the names and addresses of the Holders in accordance with TIA § 312, regardless of the source from which such information was
derived, and that the Trustee shall not be held accountable by reason of mailing any material pursuant to a request made under TIA § 312(b).
Section 2.7
Transfer and Exchange
.
Where Securities of a Series are presented to the Registrar or a
co-registrar
with a request to
register a transfer or to exchange them for an equal principal amount of Securities of the same Series, the Registrar shall register the transfer or make the exchange if its requirements for such transactions are met. To permit registrations of
transfers and exchanges, the Trustee shall authenticate Securities at the Registrar’s request. No service charge shall be made for any registration of transfer or exchange (except as otherwise expressly permitted herein), but the Company may
require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or similar governmental charge payable in connection therewith (other than any such transfer tax or similar governmental charge payable upon exchanges pursuant to
Section
2.11
,
3.6
or
9.6
).
Neither the Company nor the Registrar shall be required (1) to
issue, register the transfer of, or exchange Securities of any Series for the period beginning at the opening of business fifteen days immediately preceding the sending of a notice of redemption of Securities of that Series selected for redemption
and ending at the close of business on the day such notice is sent, (2) to register the transfer of or exchange Securities of any Series selected, called or being called for redemption as a whole or the portion being redeemed of any such
Securities selected, called or being called for redemption in part, or (3) to register the transfer of or exchange Securities of any Series between a record date and payment date for such Series of Securities.
14
Section 2.8
Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost and Stolen Securities
.
If any mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange
therefor a new Security of the same Series and of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
If there shall be delivered to the Company and the Trustee (1) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any
Security and (2) such security or indemnity bond as may be required by each of them to hold itself and any of its agents harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security has been acquired by a bona fide
purchaser, the Company shall execute and upon receipt of a Company Order the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery, in lieu of any such destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security of the same Series and of like tenor and
principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.
In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security
has become or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay such Security.
Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other
governmental charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.
Every new Security of any Series issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an
original additional contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with
any and all other Securities of that Series duly issued hereunder.
The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude
(to the extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.
Section 2.9
Outstanding Securities
.
The Securities outstanding at any time are all the Securities authenticated by the Trustee except for those canceled by it, those delivered to
it for cancellation, those reductions in the interest on a Global Security effected by the Trustee in accordance with the provisions hereof and those described in this Section as not outstanding.
If a Security is replaced pursuant to
Section
2.8
, it ceases to be outstanding until the Trustee receives proof
satisfactory to it that the replaced Security is held by a bona fide purchaser.
If the Paying Agent (other than the Company, a Subsidiary
or an Affiliate of any thereof) holds on the Maturity of Securities of a Series money sufficient to pay such Securities payable on that date, then on and after that date such Securities of the Series cease to be outstanding and interest on them
ceases to accrue.
15
The Company may purchase or otherwise acquire the Securities, whether by open market
purchases, negotiated transactions or otherwise. A Security does not cease to be outstanding because the Company or an Affiliate holds the Security (but see
Section
2.10
below).
In determining whether the Holders of the requisite principal amount of outstanding Securities have given any request, demand, authorization,
direction, notice, consent or waiver hereunder, (1) the principal amount of a Discount Security that shall be deemed to be outstanding for such purposes shall be the amount of the principal thereof that would be due and payable as of the date
of such determination upon a declaration of acceleration of the Maturity thereof pursuant to
Section
6.2
, and (2) the principal amount of a Security denominated in any Foreign Currency or composite currency which shall
be deemed to be outstanding for such purposes shall be the Dollars equivalent, determined as of such date in the manner provided as contemplated by
Section
2.2
, of the principal amount of such Security (or, in the case of a
Security described in
clause (1)
above, of the amount determined as provided in such clause).
Section 2.10
Treasury
Securities
.
In determining whether the Holders of the required principal amount of Securities of a Series have concurred in any
request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, waiver or consent, Securities of a Series owned by the Company or any Affiliate shall be disregarded, except that for the purposes of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on
any such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, waiver or consent, only Securities of a Series that a Responsible Officer of the Trustee knows are so owned shall be so disregarded.
Section 2.11
Temporary Securities
.
Until definitive Securities are ready for delivery, the Company may prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate temporary Securities upon a
Company Order. Temporary Securities shall be substantially in the form of definitive Securities but may have variations that the Company considers appropriate for temporary Securities. Without unreasonable delay, the Company shall prepare and the
Trustee upon receipt of a Company Order shall authenticate definitive Securities of the same Series and date of maturity in exchange for temporary Securities. Until so exchanged, temporary securities shall have the same rights under this Indenture
as the definitive Securities.
Section 2.12
Cancellation
.
The Company at any time may deliver Securities to the Trustee for cancellation. The Registrar and the Paying Agent shall forward to the
Trustee any Securities surrendered to them for registration of transfer, exchange or payment. The Trustee shall cancel all Securities surrendered for transfer, exchange, payment, replacement or cancellation and shall destroy such canceled Securities
(subject to the record retention requirements of the Exchange Act and the Trustee) and deliver a certificate of such cancellation to the Company upon written request of the Company. The Company may not issue new Securities to replace Securities that
it has paid or delivered to the Trustee for cancellation.
16
Section 2.13
Defaulted Interest
.
If the Company defaults in a payment of interest on a Series of Securities, it shall pay the defaulted interest, plus, to the extent permitted
by law, any interest payable on the defaulted interest, to the Persons who are Holders of the Series on a subsequent special record date. The Company shall fix the record date and payment date. At least 30 days before the special record date, the
Company shall send to the Trustee and to each Holder of the Series a notice that states the special record date, the payment date and the amount of interest to be paid. The Company may pay defaulted interest in any other lawful manner.
Section 2.14
Global Securities
.
(a)

. Notwithstanding any provisions to the contrary contained in
Section
2.7
of this
Indenture and in addition thereto, any Global Security shall be exchangeable pursuant to
Section
2.7
of this Indenture for Securities registered in the names of Holders other than the Depositary for such Security or its
nominee only if (1) such Depositary notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Global Security or if at any time such Depositary ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the Exchange Act, and,
in either case, the Company fails to appoint a successor Depositary registered as a clearing agency under the Exchange Act within 90 days of such event or (2) the Company executes and delivers to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate to
the effect that such Global Security shall be so exchangeable. Any Global Security that is exchangeable pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be exchangeable for Securities registered in such names as the Depositary shall direct in writing in an
aggregate principal amount equal to the principal amount of the Global Security with like tenor and terms.
Except as provided in this
Section
2.14(b)
a Global Security may not be transferred except as a whole by the Depositary with respect to such Global Security to a nominee of such Depositary, by a nominee of such Depositary to such Depositary or
another nominee of such Depositary or by the Depositary or any such nominee to a successor Depositary or a nominee of such a successor Depositary.
None of the Trustee or any Agent shall have any obligation or duty to monitor, determine or inquire as to compliance with any restrictions on
transfer imposed under this Indenture or under applicable law with respect to any transfer of any interest in any Security (including any transfers between or among Depositary participants, members or beneficial owners in any Global Security) other
than to require delivery of such certificates and other documentation or evidence as are expressly required by, and to do so if and when expressly required by the terms of, this Indenture, and to examine the same to determine substantial compliance
as to form with the express requirements hereof.
17
None of the Trustee or any Agent shall have any responsibility or obligation to any
beneficial owner of a Global Security, a member of, or a participant in the Depositary or other Person with respect to the accuracy of the records of the Depositary or its nominee or of any participant or member thereof, with respect to any
ownership interest in any Security or with respect to the delivery to any participant, member, beneficial owner or other Person (other than the Depositary) of any notice (including any notice of optional redemption) or the payment of any amount,
under or with respect to such Security.
(c)

following form:
“THIS SECURITY IS A GLOBAL SECURITY WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE INDENTURE HEREINAFTER REFERRED TO AND IS REGISTERED IN
THE NAME OF THE DEPOSITARY OR A NOMINEE OF THE DEPOSITARY. THIS SECURITY IS EXCHANGEABLE FOR SECURITIES REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF A PERSON OTHER THAN THE DEPOSITARY OR ITS NOMINEE ONLY IN THE LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES DESCRIBED IN THE INDENTURE, AND MAY

NOMINEE OF SUCH A SUCCESSOR DEPOSITARY.”
In addition, so long as The Depository Trust Company (“

(e)
Payments

Section
2.2
, payment of the principal of and interest, if any, on any Global Security shall be made to the Holder thereof.
18
(f)
Agent Members
. The registered Holder of a Security will be treated as the owner
of such Security for all purposes and only registered Holders shall have rights under this Indenture and the Securities. Members of, or participants in, the Depositary (“
Agent Members
”) and Persons who hold beneficial interests in
a Global Security through an Agent Member shall have no rights under this Indenture with respect to any Global Security held on their behalf by the Depositary. The Depositary may be treated by the Company, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the
Registrar and any agent of the foregoing as the absolute owner of the Global Securities for all purposes whatsoever. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein shall prevent the Company, the Trustee, the Paying Agent, the Registrar or any agent
of the foregoing from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by the Depositary or impair, as between the Depositary and its Agent Members, the operation of customary practices of such Depositary governing

shall use such numbers in notices of redemption as a convenience to Holders;
provided
that any such notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities or as contained in

, the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities of any Series by notice to the Trustee (including
consents obtained in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer for the Securities of such Series) may waive compliance by the Company with any provision of this Indenture or the Securities with respect to such Series.
It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders of Securities under this
Section
9.2
to approve the
particular form of any proposed supplemental indenture or waiver, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the substance thereof. After a supplemental indenture or waiver under this section becomes effective, the Company shall send to the
Holders of Securities affected thereby, a notice briefly describing the supplemental indenture or waiver. Any failure by the Company to send such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of any such
supplemental indenture or waiver.
Section 9.3
Limitations

(a) reduce the principal amount of Securities whose Holders must consent to an amendment, supplement or waiver;
(b) reduce the rate of or extend the time for payment of interest (including default interest) on any Security;
(c) reduce the principal or change the Stated Maturity of any Security or reduce the amount of, or postpone the date fixed for, the payment of
any sinking fund or analogous obligation, if applicable;
(d) reduce the principal amount of Discount Securities payable upon acceleration
of the maturity thereof;
(e) waive a Default or Event of Default in the payment of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest, if
any, on any Security (except a rescission of acceleration of the Securities of any Series by the Holders of at least a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities of such Series and a waiver of the payment default that resulted from
such acceleration);
(f) make the principal of or interest, if any, on any Security payable in any currency other than that stated in the
Security;

Section 9.4
Compliance with Trust Indenture Act
.
Every amendment to this Indenture or the Securities of one or more Series shall be set forth in a supplemental indenture hereto that complies
with the TIA as then in effect.
Section 9.5
Revocation and Effect of Consents
.
Until an amendment is set forth in a supplemental indenture or a waiver becomes effective, a consent to it by a Holder of a Security is a
continuing consent by the Holder and every subsequent Holder of a Security or portion of a Security that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder’s Security, even if notation of the consent is not made on any Security. However, any
such Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the consent as to his Security or portion of a Security if the Trustee receives the notice of revocation before the date of the supplemental indenture or the date the waiver becomes effective.
Any amendment or waiver once effective shall bind every Holder of each Series affected by such amendment or waiver unless it is of the type
described in any of
clauses (a)
through
(g)
of
Section
9.3
. In that case, the amendment or waiver shall bind each Holder of a Security who has consented to it and every subsequent Holder of a Security or
portion of a Security that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder’s Security.
The Company may, but shall not be obligated
to, fix a record date for the purpose of determining the Holders entitled to give their consent or take any other action described above or required or permitted to be taken pursuant to this Indenture. If a record date is fixed, then notwithstanding
the second immediately preceding paragraph, those Persons who were Holders at such record date (or their duly designated proxies), and only those Persons, shall be entitled to give such consent or to revoke any consent previously given or take any
such action, whether or not such Persons continue to be Holders after such record date. No such consent shall be valid or effective for more than 120 days after such record date.
Section 9.6
Notation on or Exchange of Securities
.
The Company or the Trustee, but shall not be obligated to, may place an appropriate notation about an amendment or waiver on any Security of
any Series thereafter authenticated. The Company in exchange for Securities of that Series may issue and the Trustee shall authenticate upon receipt of a Company Order in accordance with
Section
2.3
new Securities of that
Series that reflect the amendment or waiver.
Section 9.7
Trustee Protected

In executing, or accepting the additional trusts created by, any supplemental indenture permitted by this Article or the modifications
thereby of the trusts created by this Indenture, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive, upon request, an Officer’s Certificate and/or an Opinion of Counsel complying with
Sections 10.4

10.5

(the “
Judgment Currency
”), the rate of exchange used shall be the rate at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Trustee could purchase in the City of New York the Required Currency with the Judgment Currency on
the day on which final unappealable judgment is entered, unless such day is not a New York Banking Day, then, the rate of exchange used shall be the rate at which in accordance with normal banking procedures the Trustee could purchase in the City of
New York the Required Currency with the Judgment Currency on the New York Banking Day preceding the day on which final unappealable judgment is entered and (2) its obligations under this Indenture to make payments in the Required Currency
(i) shall not be discharged or satisfied by any tender, any recovery pursuant to any judgment (whether or not entered in accordance with
subsection (1)
), in any currency other than the Required Currency, except to the extent that such
tender or recovery shall result in the actual receipt, by the payee, of the full amount of the Required Currency expressed to be payable in respect of such payments, (ii) shall be enforceable as an alternative or additional cause of action for

the terms of such Securities pursuant to
Section
2.2

The minimum amount of any sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of the Securities of any Series is herein referred to as a
“
Mandatory Sinking Fund Payment
” and any other amount provided for by the terms of Securities of such Series is herein referred to as an “
Optional Sinking Fund Payment
.” If provided for by the terms of
Securities of any Series, the cash amount of any sinking fund payment may be subject to reduction as provided in

provided for by the terms of the Securities of such Series.
Section 11.2
Satisfaction of Sinking Fund Payments with
Securities
.
The Company may, in satisfaction of all or any part of any sinking fund payment with respect to the Securities of any
Series to be made pursuant to the terms of such Securities (1) deliver outstanding Securities of such Series to which such sinking fund payment is applicable (other than any of such Securities previously called for mandatory sinking fund
redemption) and (2) apply as credit Securities of such Series to which such sinking fund payment is applicable and which have been repurchased by the Company or redeemed either at the election of the Company pursuant to the terms of such Series
of Securities (except pursuant to any mandatory sinking fund) or through the application of permitted Optional Sinking Fund Payments or other optional redemptions pursuant to the terms of such Securities, provided that such Securities have not been
previously so credited. Such Securities shall be received by the Trustee, together with an Officer’s Certificate with respect thereto, not later than 15 days prior to the date on which the Trustee begins the process of selecting Securities for
redemption, and shall be credited for such purpose by the Trustee at the price specified in such Securities for redemption through operation of the sinking fund and the amount of such sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly. If as a result
of the delivery or credit of Securities in lieu of cash payments pursuant to this
Section
11.2
, the principal amount of Securities of such Series to be redeemed in order to exhaust the aforesaid cash payment shall be less
than $100,000, the Trustee need not call Securities of such Series for redemption, except upon receipt of a Company Order that such action be taken, and such cash payment shall be held by the Trustee or a Paying Agent and applied to the next
succeeding sinking fund payment,
provided
,
however
, that the Trustee or such Paying Agent shall from time to time upon receipt of a Company Order pay over and deliver to the Company any cash payment so being held by the Trustee or such
Paying Agent upon delivery by the Company to the Trustee of Securities of that Series purchased by the Company having an unpaid principal amount equal to the cash payment required to be released to the Company.

such sinking fund payment date will be selected in the manner specified in
