Section 40
of the Lease is hereby deleted in its entirety and is of no further force or effect.

From and after the Early Termination Date, Tenant shall have no further rights with respect to the Premises. Notwithstanding the foregoing, those provisions of the Lease which, by their terms, survive the termination of the Lease shall survive the surrender of the Premises and termination of the Lease as provided herein. Nothing herein shall excuse Tenant from its obligations under the Lease prior to the Early Termination Date.

SNDA
”) with Tenant with respect to the Lease. The SNDA shall be on the Holder’s form and Tenant shall pay as Additional Rent the Holder’s fees and costs in connection with obtaining such SNDA; provided, however, that Landlord shall request that Holder make any reasonable changes to the SNDA requested by Tenant. Landlord’s failure to cause the Holder to enter into the SNDA with Tenant (or make any of the changes requested by Tenant) despite such efforts shall not be a default by Landlord under the Lease.
