RIGHTS
AGREEMENT
Rights Agreement, dated as of
November 17,
2025
(“Agreement”), between Oramed Pharmaceuticals Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the “Company”), and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as Rights Agent (the “Rights Agent”).
The Board of Directors of the
Company has authorized and declared a dividend of one common share purchase right (a “Right”) for each share of Common Stock
(as hereinafter defined) outstanding as of the Close of Business (as defined below) on November 27,
2025
(the “Record Date”), each Right initially representing the right to purchase one share of Common Stock (as hereinafter defined
and subject to adjustment as provided herein), upon the terms and subject to the conditions herein set forth, and has further authorized
and directed the issuance of one Right (subject to adjustment as provided herein) with respect to each share of Common Stock that shall
become outstanding between the Record Date and the earlier of the Distribution Date and the Expiration Date (as such terms are hereinafter
defined);
provided
,
however
, that Rights may be issued with respect to shares of Common Stock that shall become outstanding
after the Distribution Date and prior to the Expiration Date in accordance with Section 22.
Accordingly, in consideration
of the premises and the mutual agreements herein set forth, the parties hereby agree as follows:
Section 1.
Certain Definitions
.
For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms have the meaning indicated:
(a)
“Acquiring Person” shall mean any Person (as such term is hereinafter defined) who or which shall be the Beneficial Owner
(as such term is hereinafter defined) of 15% or more of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding, but shall not include an Exempt Person
(as such term is hereinafter defined);
provided
,
however
, that
(i)
if the Board of Directors of the Company determines that a Person who would otherwise be an “Acquiring Person” became
the Beneficial Owner of a number of shares of Common Stock such that the Person would otherwise qualify as an “Acquiring Person”
inadvertently (including, without limitation, because (A) such Person was unaware that it beneficially owned that number of shares of
Common Stock that would otherwise cause such Person to be an “Acquiring Person” or (B) such Person was aware of the extent of
its Beneficial Ownership of Common Stock but had no actual knowledge of the consequences of such Beneficial Ownership under this Agreement)
and without any intention of obtaining, changing or influencing control of the Company, then such Person shall not be deemed to be or
to have become an “Acquiring Person” for any purposes of this Agreement unless and until such Person shall have failed to divest
itself, as soon as practicable (as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company), of Beneficial Ownership of a sufficient number
of shares of Common Stock so that such Person would no longer otherwise qualify as an “Acquiring Person”;
1
(ii) if, as of the date
hereof or prior to the first public announcement of the adoption of this Agreement, any Person is or becomes the Beneficial Owner of
15% or more of the shares of Common Stock outstanding, such Person shall not be deemed to be or to become an “Acquiring
Person” unless and until such time as such Person shall, after the first public announcement of the adoption of this Agreement,
become the Beneficial Owner of any additional shares of Common Stock (other than pursuant to a dividend or distribution paid or made
by the Company on the outstanding Common Stock or pursuant to a split or subdivision of the outstanding Common Stock), unless, upon
becoming the Beneficial Owner of such additional shares of Common Stock, such Person is not then the Beneficial Owner of 15% or more
of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding;
(iii) no Person shall
become an “Acquiring Person” solely as a result of any unilateral grant of any security by the Company or through the
exercise of any options, warrants, rights or similar interests (including restricted stock) granted by the Company to its directors,
officers and employees;
(iv)
no Person shall become an “Acquiring Person” solely as the result of an acquisition or cancellation of shares of Common
Stock by the Company which, by reducing the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding, increases the proportion of the shares of Common
Stock beneficially owned by such Person to 15% or more of the Common Stock then outstanding;
provided
,
however
, that if
a Person shall become the Beneficial Owner of 15% or more of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding by reason of such share acquisitions
by the Company and shall thereafter become the Beneficial Owner of any additional shares of Common Stock (other than pursuant to a dividend
or distribution paid or made by the Company on the outstanding Common Stock or pursuant to a split or subdivision of the outstanding Common
Stock), then such Person shall be deemed to be an “Acquiring Person” unless upon becoming the Beneficial Owner of such additional
shares of Common Stock such Person does not beneficially own 15% or more of the shares of Common Stock then outstanding; and
(v)
no Person shall become an “Acquiring Person” solely as the result of the acquisition by such Person of Beneficial Ownership
of shares of Common Stock from an individual who, on the later of the date hereof and the first public announcement of this Agreement,
is the Beneficial Owner of 15% or more of the Common Stock then outstanding if such shares of Common Stock are received by such Person
upon such individual’s death pursuant to such individual’s will or pursuant to a charitable trust created by such individual for estate
planning purposes.
With respect to any Person, for all purposes of
this Agreement, any calculation of the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any particular time, including for purposes of
determining the particular percentage of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of which any such Person is the Beneficial Owner, shall
include the number of shares of Common Stock not outstanding at the time of such calculation that such Person is otherwise deemed to beneficially
own for purposes of this Agreement, but the number of shares of Common Stock not outstanding that such Person is otherwise deemed to beneficially
own for purposes of this Agreement shall not be included for the purpose of computing the percentage of the outstanding shares of Common
Stock beneficially owned by any other Person (unless such other Person is also otherwise deemed to beneficially own for purposes of this
Agreement such shares of Common Stock not outstanding).
2
(b)
“Affiliate” and “Associate” shall have the respective meanings ascribed to such terms in Rule 12b-2 of the
General Rules and Regulations under the Exchange Act (as such term is hereinafter defined).

only after the passage of time or upon the satisfaction of one or more conditions) pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or
understanding (other than customary agreements with and between underwriters and selling group members with respect to a bona fide
public offering of securities), or upon the exercise of conversion rights, exchange rights, rights (other than the Rights), warrants
or options, or otherwise;
provided
,
however
, that a Person shall not be deemed the Beneficial Owner of, or to
beneficially own, (w) securities tendered pursuant to a tender or exchange offer made by or on behalf of such Person or any of such
Person’s Affiliates or Associates until such tendered securities are accepted for purchase, (x) securities which such Person has a
right to acquire upon the exercise of Rights at any time prior to the time that any Person becomes an Acquiring Person, (y)
securities issuable upon the exercise of Rights from and after the time that any Person becomes an Acquiring Person if such Rights
were acquired by such first Person or any of such first Person’s Affiliates or Associates prior to the Distribution Date or pursuant
to Section 3(a) or Section 22 hereof (“Original Rights”) or pursuant to Section 11(i) or Section 11(n) with respect to an
adjustment to Original Rights, or (z) securities which such Person or any of such Person’s Affiliates or Associates may acquire,
does or do acquire or may be deemed to have the right to acquire, pursuant to any merger or other acquisition agreement between the
Company and such Person (or one or more of such Person’s Affiliates or Associates) if such agreement has been approved by the Board
of Directors of the Company prior to such Person’s becoming an Acquiring Person; or (B) the right to vote pursuant to any
agreement, arrangement or understanding;
provided
,
however
, that a Person shall not be deemed the Beneficial Owner of,
or to beneficially own, any security by reason of such agreement, arrangement or understanding if the agreement, arrangement or
understanding to vote such security (1) arises solely from a revocable proxy or consent given to such Person in response to a public
proxy or consent solicitation made pursuant to, and in accordance with, the applicable rules and regulations promulgated under the
Exchange Act and (2) is not also then reportable on Schedule 13D under the Exchange Act (or any comparable or successor report);
3
(iii) which are
beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by any other Person (or any Affiliate or Associate of such other Person) and with
respect to which such first Person or any of such first Person’s Affiliates or Associates has (x) any agreement, arrangement or
understanding (other than customary agreements with and between underwriters and selling group members with respect to a bona fide
public offering of securities) for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting (except to the extent contemplated by the proviso to
Section 1(c)(ii)(B)) or disposing of such securities or (y) any agreement, arrangement or understanding to cooperate in obtaining,
changing or influencing control of the issuer of such securities; or
(iv)
which are beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by a Counterparty (or any of such Counterparty’s Affiliates or Associates)
under any Derivatives Contract (without regard to any short or similar position under the same or any other Derivatives Contract) to which
such Person or any of such Person’s Affiliates or Associates is a Receiving Party (as such terms are hereinafter defined) if the
Board of Directors of the Company, by a majority vote, determines that such Person is seeking to use the existence of such Derivatives
Contract or Derivatives Contracts, in combination with other securities beneficially owned by such Person, for the purpose or effect of
changing or influencing control of the Company;
provided
,
however
, that the number of shares of Common Stock that a Person
is deemed to beneficially own pursuant to this clause (iv) in connection with a particular Derivatives Contract shall not exceed the number
of Notional Common Shares (as such term is hereinafter defined) with respect to such Derivatives Contract;
provided further
that
the number of securities beneficially owned by each Counterparty (including its Affiliates and Associates) under a Derivatives Contract
shall for purposes of this clause (iv) be deemed to include all securities that are beneficially owned, directly or indirectly, by any
other Counterparty (or any of such other Counterparty’s Affiliates or Associates) under any Derivatives Contract to which such first
Counterparty (or any of such first Counterparty’s Affiliates or Associates) is a Receiving Party, with this proviso being applied
to successive Counterparties as appropriate;
provided
,
however
,
that no Person who is an officer, director or employee of an Exempt Person shall be deemed, solely by reason of such Person’s status or
authority as such, to be the “Beneficial Owner” of, to have “Beneficial Ownership” of or to “beneficially own”
any securities that are “beneficially owned” (as defined in this Section l(c)), including, without limitation, in a fiduciary

Section 3.
Issue of Right
Certificates
.
(a)
Until the Close of Business on the earlier of (i) the tenth Business Day after the Stock Acquisition Date or (ii) the tenth Business
Day (or such later date as may be determined by action of the Board of Directors of the Company prior to such time as any Person becomes
an Acquiring Person) after the date of the commencement by any Person (other than an Exempt Person) of, or of the first public announcement
of the intention of any Person (other than an Exempt Person) to commence, a tender or exchange offer the consummation of which would result
in any Person (other than an Exempt Person) having beneficial ownership or becoming an Acquiring Person (the earlier of such dates being
herein referred to as the “Distribution Date”,
provided
,
however
, that the Distribution Date shall in no event
be prior to the Record Date), (x) the Rights will be evidenced (subject to the provisions of Sections 3(b) and 3(c) hereof) by the certificates
representing the Common Stock registered in the names of the holders thereof (or by Book Entry shares in respect of such Common Stock)
and not by separate Right Certificates, and (y) the Rights will be transferable only in connection with the transfer of Common Stock.
As soon as practicable after the Distribution Date, the Company will prepare and execute, the Rights Agent will countersign and the Company
will send or cause to be sent (and the Rights Agent will, if requested, send) by first-class, insured, postage-prepaid mail, to each record
holder of Common Stock as of the Close of Business on the Distribution Date (other than any Acquiring Person or any Associate or Affiliate
of an Acquiring Person), at the address of such holder shown on the records of the Company, a Right Certificate, in substantially the
form of Exhibit A hereto (a “Right Certificate”), evidencing one Right (subject to adjustment as provided herein) for each share
of Common Stock so held. As of the Distribution Date, the Rights will be evidenced solely by such Right Certificates.
7
(b)
With respect to certificates representing Common Stock (or Book Entry shares of Common Stock) outstanding as of the Record Date,
until the Distribution Date, the Rights will be evidenced by such certificates registered in the names of the holders thereof (or such
Book Entry shares). Until the Distribution Date (or, if earlier, the Expiration Date), the surrender for transfer of any certificate representing
Common Stock (or any Book Entry shares of Common Stock) outstanding on the Record Date shall also constitute the transfer of the Rights
associated with the Common Stock represented thereby.
(c)
Rights shall, without any further action, be issued in respect of all shares of Common Stock issued or disposed of by the Company
after the Record Date but prior to the earlier of the Distribution Date and the Expiration Date or, in certain circumstances provided
in Section 22 hereof, after the Distribution Date. Certificates issued for Common Stock after the Record Date but prior to the earlier
of the Distribution Date and the Expiration Date or, in certain circumstances provided in Section 22 hereof, after the Distribution Date
shall have impressed on, printed on, written on or otherwise affixed to them the following legend:
This certificate also evidences and entitles
the holder hereof to certain Rights as set forth in a Rights Agreement between Oramed Pharmaceuticals Inc. (the “Company”) and
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as Rights Agent, dated as of November 17,
2025
and as amended from time to time (the “Rights Agreement”), the terms of which are hereby incorporated herein by reference
and a copy of which is on file at the principal executive offices of the Company. Under certain circumstances, as set forth in the Rights
Agreement, such Rights will be evidenced by separate certificates and will no longer be evidenced by this certificate. The Company will
mail to the holder of this certificate a copy of the Rights Agreement without charge after receipt of a written request therefor.
Under
certain circumstances, as set forth in the Rights Agreement, Rights owned by or transferred to any Person who is or becomes an Acquiring
Person (as defined in the Rights Agreement) and certain transferees thereof will become null and void and will no longer be transferable
.
8
With respect to any Book Entry shares of Common
Stock, such legend shall be included in a notice to the record holder of such shares in accordance with applicable law. With respect to
such certificates containing the foregoing legend, or any notice of the foregoing legend delivered to holders of Book Entry shares, until
the Distribution Date the Rights associated with the Common Stock represented by such certificates or Book Entry shares shall be evidenced
by such certificates or Book Entry shares alone, and the surrender for transfer of any such certificate or Book Entry share, except as
otherwise provided herein, shall also constitute the transfer of the Rights associated with the Common Stock represented thereby. In the
event that the Company purchases or otherwise acquires any Common Stock after the Record Date but prior to the Distribution Date, any
Rights associated with such shares shall be deemed canceled and retired so that the Company shall not be entitled to exercise any Rights
associated with such shares of Common Stock which are no longer outstanding.
Notwithstanding this paragraph
(c), neither the omission of a legend nor the failure to deliver the notice of such legend required hereby shall affect the enforceability
of any part of this Agreement or the rights of any holder of the Rights.
Section 4.
Form of Right
Certificates
. The Right Certificates (and the forms of election to purchase shares and of assignment to be printed on the reverse
thereof) shall be substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit A hereto and may have such marks of identification or designation and
such legends, summaries or endorsements printed thereon as the Company may deem appropriate and as are not inconsistent with the provisions
of this Agreement, or as may be required to comply with any applicable law or with any rule or regulation made pursuant thereto or with
any rule or regulation of any stock exchange or interdealer quotation system on which the Rights may from time to time be listed or quoted,
or to conform to usage. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, each Right Certificate shall entitle the holder thereof to purchase
one share of Common Stock at the Purchase Price, but the number of shares of Common Stock and the Purchase Price shall be subject to adjustment
as provided herein.
Section 5.
Countersignature
and Registration
.
(a)
The Right Certificates shall be executed on behalf of the Company by the President, the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial
Officer, the Chief Administrative Officer, the Treasurer, the Secretary of the Company or any other duly authorized officer of the Company,
either manually or by facsimile signature, shall have affixed thereto the Company’s seal or a facsimile thereof and shall be attested
by the Secretary of the Company, either manually or by facsimile signature. The Right Certificates shall be manually or by facsimile countersigned
by the Rights Agent and shall not be valid for any purpose unless countersigned. In case any officer of the Company who shall have signed
any of the Right Certificates shall cease to be such officer of the Company before countersignature by the Rights Agent and issuance and
delivery by the Company, such Right Certificates, nevertheless, may be countersigned by the Rights Agent and issued and delivered by the
Company with the same force and effect as though the Person who signed such Right Certificates had not ceased to be such officer of the
Company; and any Right Certificate may be signed on behalf of the Company by any Person who, at the actual date of the execution of such
Right Certificate, shall be a proper officer of the Company to sign such Right Certificate, although at the date of the execution of this
Agreement any such Person was not such an officer.
9
(b)
Following the Distribution Date, the Rights Agent will keep or cause to be kept, at an office or agency designated for such purpose,
books for registration and transfer of the Right Certificates issued hereunder. Such books shall show the names and addresses of the respective
holders of the Right Certificates, the number of Rights evidenced on its face by each of the Right Certificates and the date of each of
the Right Certificates.
Section 6.
Transfer, Split
Up, Combination and Exchange of Right Certificates; Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Right Certificates; Uncertificated Rights
.
(a)
Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at any time after the Distribution Date and prior to the Expiration Date, any Right
Certificate or Right Certificates (other than Right Certificates representing Rights that have become void pursuant to Section 11(a)(ii)
hereof or that have been exchanged pursuant to Section 24 hereof) may be transferred, split up, combined or exchanged for another Right
Certificate or Right Certificates, entitling the registered holder to purchase a like number of shares of Common Stock as the Right Certificate
or Right Certificates surrendered then entitled such holder to purchase. Any registered holder desiring to transfer, split up, combine
or exchange any Right Certificate or Right Certificates shall make such request in writing delivered to the Rights Agent, and shall surrender
the Right Certificate or Right Certificates to be transferred, split up, combined or exchanged at the office or agency of the Rights Agent
designated for such purpose. Thereupon the Rights Agent shall countersign and deliver to the Person entitled thereto a Right Certificate
or Right Certificates, as the case may be, as so requested. The Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or governmental
charge that may be imposed in connection with any transfer, split up, combination or exchange of Right Certificates.
(b)
Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, at any time after the Distribution Date and prior to the Expiration Date, upon receipt
by the Company and the Rights Agent of evidence reasonably satisfactory to them of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of a Right
Certificate, and, in case of loss, theft or destruction, of indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to them, and, at the Company’s
request, reimbursement to the Company and the Rights Agent of all reasonable expenses incidental thereto, and upon surrender to the Rights
Agent and cancellation of the Right Certificate if mutilated, the Company will make and deliver a new Right Certificate of like tenor
to the Rights Agent for delivery to the registered holder in lieu of the Right Certificate so lost, stolen, destroyed or mutilated.
10
(c)
Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, the Company and the Rights Agent may amend this Agreement to provide for uncertificated
Rights in addition to or in place of Rights evidenced by Right Certificates, to the extent permitted by applicable law.
Section 7.
Exercise of Rights,
Purchase Price; Expiration Date of Rights
.
(a)
Except as otherwise provided herein, the Rights shall become exercisable on the Distribution Date, and thereafter the registered
holder of any Right Certificate (other than Right Certificates representing Rights that have become void pursuant to Section 11(a)(ii)
hereof or that have been exchanged pursuant to Section 24 hereof) may, subject to Section 11(a)(ii) hereof and except as otherwise provided
herein, exercise the Rights evidenced thereby in whole or in part upon surrender of the Right Certificate, with the form of election to
purchase on the reverse side thereof duly executed, to the Rights Agent at the office or agency of the Rights Agent designated for such
purpose, together with payment of the aggregate Purchase Price with respect to the total number of shares of Common Stock (or other securities,
cash or other assets, as the case may be) as to which the Rights are exercised, at any time which is both after the Distribution Date
and prior to the time (the “Expiration Date”) that is the earliest of (i) the Close of Business on the third anniversary of

the closing of any merger or other acquisition transaction involving the Company pursuant to an agreement of the type described in Sections
1(c)(ii)(A)(z) and 13(f) at which time the Rights are terminated, or (iv) the time at which such Rights are exchanged as provided in Section
24 hereof.
(b)
The Purchase Price shall be initially $10.00 for each share of Common Stock purchasable upon the exercise of a Right (the “Purchase

of a Right shall be subject to adjustment from time to time as provided in Sections 11 and 13 hereof and shall be payable in lawful money
of the United States of America in accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section 7.
(c)
Except as otherwise provided herein, upon receipt of a Right Certificate representing exercisable Rights, with the form of election
to purchase duly executed, accompanied by payment of the aggregate Purchase Price for the shares of Common Stock to be purchased and an
amount equal to any applicable transfer tax required to be paid by the holder of such Right Certificate in accordance with Section 9 hereof,
in cash or by certified check, cashier’s check or money order payable to the order of the Company, the Rights Agent shall thereupon promptly
(i) (A) requisition from any transfer agent of the Common Stock, or make available if the Rights Agent is the transfer agent for the Common
Stock, certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to be purchased, and the Company hereby irrevocably authorizes its transfer
agent to comply with all such requests, or (B) requisition from a depositary agent appointed by the Company depositary receipts representing
interests in such number of shares of Common Stock as are to be purchased (in which case certificates for the Common Stock represented
by such receipts shall be deposited by the transfer agent with the depositary agent), and the Company hereby directs any such depositary
agent to comply with such request, (ii) when appropriate, requisition from the Company the amount of cash to be paid in lieu of issuance
of fractional shares in accordance with Section 14 hereof, (iii) promptly after receipt of such certificates or depositary receipts, cause
the same to be delivered to or upon the order of the registered holder of such Right Certificate, registered in such name or names as
may be designated by such holder and (iv) when appropriate, after receipt, promptly deliver such cash to or upon the order of the registered
holder of such Right Certificate.
11
(d)
Except as otherwise provided herein, in case the registered holder of any Right Certificate shall exercise less than all of the
Rights evidenced thereby, a new Right Certificate evidencing Rights equivalent to the exercisable Rights remaining unexercised shall be
issued by the Rights Agent to the registered holder of such Right Certificate or to his duly authorized assigns, subject to the provisions
of Section 14 hereof.
(e)
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, neither the Rights Agent nor the Company shall be obligated to undertake
any action with respect to a registered holder of Rights upon the occurrence of any purported transfer or exercise of Rights pursuant
to Section 6 hereof or this Section 7 unless such registered holder shall have (i) completed and signed the certificate contained in the
form of assignment or form of election to purchase set forth on the reverse side of the Right Certificate surrendered for such transfer
or exercise and (ii) provided such additional evidence of the identity of the Beneficial Owner (or former Beneficial Owner) thereof as
the Company shall reasonably request.
Section 8.
Cancellation and
Destruction of Right Certificates
. All Right Certificates surrendered for the purpose of exercise, transfer, split up, combination
or exchange shall, if surrendered to the Company or to any of its agents, be delivered to the Rights Agent for cancellation or in canceled
form, or, if surrendered to the Rights Agent, shall be canceled by it, and no Right Certificates shall be issued in lieu thereof except
as expressly permitted by any of the provisions of this Agreement. The Company shall deliver to the Rights Agent for cancellation and
retirement, and the Rights Agent shall so cancel and retire, any other Right Certificate purchased or acquired by the Company otherwise
than upon the exercise thereof. The Rights Agent shall deliver all canceled Right Certificates to the Company, or shall, at the written
request of the Company, destroy such canceled Right Certificates, and in such case shall deliver a certificate of destruction thereof
to the Company.
Section 9.
Availability of
Shares of Common Stock
.
(a)
From and after such time as the Rights become exercisable, the Company shall use its best efforts to cause all shares of Common
Stock reserved for issuance upon the exercise of Rights to be listed or admitted to trading on a national security exchange upon official
notice of issuance upon such exercise.
12
(b)
From and after such time as the Rights become exercisable, the Company shall use its best efforts, if then necessary to permit
the issuance of shares of Common Stock upon the exercise of Rights, to register and qualify such shares of Common Stock under the Securities
Act and any applicable state securities or “Blue Sky” laws (to the extent exemptions therefrom are not available), cause such
registration statement and qualifications to become effective as soon as possible after such filing and keep such registration and qualifications
effective (with a prospectus at all times meeting the requirements of the Securities Act) until the earlier of the date as of which the
Rights are no longer exercisable for such securities and the Expiration Date. The Company may temporarily suspend, for a period of time
not to exceed 120 days, the exercisability of the Rights in order to prepare and file a registration statement under the Securities Act
and permit it to become effective. Upon any such suspension, the Company shall issue a public announcement stating that the exercisability
of the Rights has been temporarily suspended, as well as a public announcement at such time as the suspension is no longer in effect.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the Rights shall not be exercisable in any jurisdiction unless the requisite
qualification in such jurisdiction shall have been obtained and until a registration statement under the Securities Act shall have been
declared effective, unless an exemption therefrom is available.
(c)
The Company covenants and agrees that it will take all such action as may be necessary to ensure that all shares of Common Stock
delivered upon exercise of Rights shall, at the time of delivery of the certificates therefor (subject to payment of the Purchase Price),
be duly and validly authorized and issued and fully paid and nonassessable shares.
(d)
The Company further covenants and agrees that it will pay when due and payable any and all federal and state transfer taxes and
charges which may be payable in respect of the issuance or delivery of the Right Certificates or of any shares of Common Stock upon the
exercise of Rights. The Company shall not, however, be required to pay any transfer tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer
or delivery of Right Certificates to a Person other than, or the issuance or delivery of certificates or depositary receipts for the Common
Stock in a name other than that of, the registered holder of the Right Certificate evidencing Rights surrendered for exercise or to issue
or deliver any certificates or depositary receipts for Common Stock upon the exercise of any Rights until any such tax shall have been
paid (any such tax being payable by that holder of such Right Certificate at the time of surrender) or until it has been established to
the Company’s reasonable satisfaction that no such tax is due.
Section 10.
Common Stock
Record Date
. Each Person in whose name any certificate for Common Stock is issued upon the exercise of Rights shall for all purposes
be deemed to have become the holder of record of the shares of Common Stock represented thereby on, and such certificate shall be dated,
the date upon which the Right Certificate evidencing such Rights was duly surrendered and payment of the Purchase Price therefor (and
any applicable transfer taxes) was made;
provided
,
however
, that if the date of such surrender and payment is a date upon
which the Common Stock transfer books of the Company are closed, such Person shall be deemed to have become the record holder of such
shares on, and such certificate shall be dated, the next succeeding Business Day on which the Common Stock transfer books of the Company
are open. Prior to the exercise of the Rights evidenced thereby, the holder of a Right Certificate shall not be entitled to any rights
of a holder of Common Stock for which the Rights shall be exercisable, including, without limitation, the right to vote or to receive
dividends or other distributions, and shall not be entitled to receive any notice of any proceedings of the Company, except as provided
herein.
13
Section 11.
Adjustment of
Purchase Price, Number and Kind of Shares and Number of Rights
. The Purchase Price, the number of shares of Common Stock or other
securities or property purchasable upon exercise of each Right and the number of Rights outstanding are subject to adjustment from time
to time as provided in this Section 11.
(a)
(i) In the event the Company shall at any time after the date of this Agreement (A) declare and pay a dividend on the Common Stock
payable in shares of Common Stock, (B) subdivide the outstanding Common Stock, (C) combine the outstanding Common Stock into a smaller
number of shares of Common Stock or (D) issue any shares of its capital stock in a reclassification of the Common Stock (including any
such reclassification in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the Company is the continuing or surviving corporation), except
as otherwise provided in this Section 11(a), the number and kind of shares of capital stock issuable upon exercise of a Right as of the
record date for such dividend or the effective date of such subdivision, combination or reclassification shall be proportionately adjusted
so that the holder of any Right exercised after such time shall be entitled to receive the aggregate number and kind of shares of capital
stock which, if such Right had been exercised immediately prior to such date and at a time when the Common Stock transfer books of the
Company were open, the holder would have owned upon such exercise and been entitled to receive by virtue of such dividend, subdivision,
combination or reclassification.
(ii) Subject to Section
24 of this Agreement, in the event any Person becomes an Acquiring Person (the first occurrence of such event being referred to
hereinafter as the “Flip-In Event”), then (A) the Purchase Price shall be adjusted to be the Purchase Price in effect
immediately prior to the Flip-In Event multiplied by the number of shares of Common Stock for which a Right was exercisable
immediately prior to such Flip-In Event, whether or not such Right was then exercisable, and (B) each holder of a Right, except as
otherwise provided in this Section 11(a)(ii) and Section 11(a)(iii) hereof, shall thereafter have the right to receive, upon
exercise thereof at a price equal to the Purchase Price (as so adjusted), in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such
number of shares of Common Stock as shall equal the result obtained by dividing the Purchase Price (as so adjusted) by 50% of the
current per share market price of the Common Stock (determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) on the date of such Flip-In Event;
provided
,
however
,
that the Purchase Price (as so adjusted) and the number of shares of Common Stock so receivable upon exercise of a Right shall,
following the Flip-In Event, be subject to further adjustment as appropriate in accordance with Section 11(f) hereof.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, however, from and after the Flip-In Event, any Rights that are
beneficially owned by (x) any Acquiring Person (or any Affiliate or Associate of any Acquiring Person), (y) a transferee of any
Acquiring Person (or of any such Affiliate or Associate) who becomes a transferee after the Flip-In Event or (z) a transferee of any
Acquiring Person (or of any such Affiliate or Associate) who became a transferee prior to or concurrently with the Flip-In Event
pursuant to either (I) a transfer (whether or not for consideration) from the Acquiring Person to holders of its equity securities
or to any Person with whom it has any continuing agreement, arrangement or understanding regarding the transferred Rights or
(II) a transfer which the Board of Directors of the Company has determined is part of a plan, arrangement or understanding
which has the purpose or effect of avoiding the provisions of this paragraph, and subsequent transferees, either direct transferees
or transferees through one or more intermediate transferees, of such Persons, shall be void without any further action and any
holder of such Rights shall thereafter have no rights whatsoever with respect to such Rights under any provision of this Agreement.
The Company shall use all reasonable efforts to ensure that the provisions of this Section 11(a)(ii) are complied with, but shall
have no liability to any holder of Right Certificates or other Person as a result of its failure to make any determinations with
respect to an Acquiring Person, its Affiliates or Associates or its or their transferees hereunder. From and after the Flip-In
Event, no Right Certificate shall be issued pursuant to Section 3 or Section 6 hereof that represents Rights that are or have become
void pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph, and any Right Certificate delivered to the Rights Agent that represents Rights
that are or have become void pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph shall be canceled. From and after the occurrence of an
event specified in Section 13(a) hereof, any Rights that theretofore have not been exercised pursuant to this Section 11(a)(ii)
shall thereafter be exercisable only in accordance with Section 13 and not pursuant to this Section 11(a)(ii).
14
(iii) In the event that
there shall not be sufficient shares of Common Stock issued but not outstanding or authorized but unissued to permit the exercise in
full of the Rights in accordance with the foregoing subparagraph (ii), the Board of Directors of the Company shall, with respect to
such deficiency, to the extent permitted by applicable law and any material agreements then in effect to which the Company is a
party, (A) determine the excess (such excess, the “Spread”) of (1) the value of the shares of Common Stock issuable upon
the exercise of a Right in accordance with the foregoing subparagraph (ii) (the “Current Value”) over (2) the
Purchase Price (as adjusted in accordance with the foregoing subparagraph (ii)), and (B) with respect to each Right (other than
Rights which have become void pursuant to the foregoing subparagraph (ii)), make adequate provision to substitute for the shares of
Common Stock issuable in accordance with the foregoing subparagraph (ii) upon exercise of the Right and payment of the Purchase
Price (as adjusted in accordance therewith), (1) cash, (2) a reduction in such Purchase Price, (3) debt securities of the Company,
(4) other assets, or (5) any combination of the foregoing, having a value which, when added to the value of the shares of Common
Stock issued upon exercise of such Right, shall have an aggregate value equal to the Current Value (less the amount of any reduction
in such Purchase Price), where such aggregate value has been determined by the Board of Directors of the Company;
provided
,
however
,
that if the Company shall not make adequate provision to deliver value pursuant to clause (B) above within thirty (30) days
following the Flip-In Event (the date of the Flip-In Event being the “Section 11(a)(ii) Trigger Date”), then the Company
shall be obligated to deliver, to the extent permitted by applicable law and any material agreements then in effect to which the
Company is a party, upon the surrender for exercise of a Right and without requiring payment of such Purchase Price, shares of
Common Stock (to the extent available), and then, if necessary, an amount of cash, which shares and/or cash have an aggregate value
equal to the Spread. If, upon the occurrence of the Flip-In Event, the Board of Directors of the Company shall determine that it is
likely that sufficient additional shares of Common Stock could be authorized for issuance upon exercise in full of the Rights, then,
if the Board of Directors of the Company so elects, the thirty (30) day period set forth above may be extended to the extent
necessary, but not more than ninety (90) days after the Section 11(a)(ii) Trigger Date, in order that the Company may seek
stockholder approval for the authorization of such additional shares (such thirty (30) day period, as it may be extended, is herein
called the “Substitution Period”). To the extent that the Company determines that some action need be taken pursuant to
the first and/or second sentence of this Section 11(a)(iii), the Company (x) shall provide, subject to Section 11(a)(ii) hereof and
the last sentence of this Section 11(a)(iii) hereof, that such action shall apply uniformly to all outstanding Rights and (y) may
suspend the exercisability of the Rights until the expiration of the Substitution Period in order to seek any authorization of
additional shares and/or to decide the appropriate form of distribution to be made pursuant to such first sentence and to determine
the value thereof. In the event of any such suspension, the Company shall issue a public announcement stating that the
exercisability of the Rights has been temporarily suspended, as well as a public announcement at such time as the suspension is no
longer in effect. For purposes of this Section 11(a)(iii), the per share value of the shares of Common Stock shall be the current
per share market price (as determined pursuant to Section 11(d)(i)) on the Section 11(a)(ii) Trigger Date shall be deemed to equal
the current per share market price of the Common Stock. The Board of Directors of the Company may, but shall not be required to,
establish procedures to allocate the right to receive shares of Common Stock upon the exercise of the Rights among the holders of
Rights pursuant to this Section 11(a)(iii).
(b)
In case the Company shall fix a record date for the issuance of rights, options or warrants to all holders of Common Stock entitling
them (for a period expiring within 45 calendar days after such record date) to subscribe for or purchase Common Stock or securities convertible
into Common Stock at a price per share of Common Stock (or having a conversion price per share, if a security convertible into shares
of Common Stock) less than the then current per share market price of the Common Stock (determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) on
such record date, the Purchase Price to be in effect after such record date shall be determined by multiplying the Purchase Price in effect
immediately prior to such record date by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
on such record date plus the number of shares of Common Stock which the aggregate offering price of the total number of shares of Common
Stock so to be offered (and/or the aggregate initial conversion price of the convertible securities so to be offered) would purchase at
such current market price, and the denominator of which shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on such record date
plus the number of additional shares of Common Stock to be offered for subscription or purchase (or into which the convertible securities
so to be offered are initially convertible);
provided
,
however
, that in no event shall the consideration to be paid upon
the exercise of one Right be less than the aggregate par value of the shares of capital stock of the Company issuable upon exercise of
one Right. In case such subscription price may be paid in consideration part or all of which shall be in a form other than cash, the value
of such consideration shall be as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company, whose determination shall be described in a statement
filed with the Rights Agent. Shares of Common Stock (or convertible securities) owned by or held for the account of the Company shall
not be deemed outstanding for the purpose of any such computation. Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever such a record date
is fixed; and in the event that such rights, options or warrants are not so issued, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted to be the Purchase
Price which would then be in effect if such record date had not been fixed.
15
(c)
In case the Company shall fix a record date for the making of a distribution to all holders of the Common Stock (including any
such distribution made in connection with a consolidation or merger in which the Company is the continuing or surviving corporation) of
evidences of indebtedness or assets (other than a regular quarterly cash dividend or a dividend payable in Common Stock) or subscription
rights or warrants (excluding those referred to in Section 11(b) hereof), the Purchase Price to be in effect after such record date shall
be determined by multiplying the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to such record date by a fraction, the numerator of which
shall be the then current per share market price of the Common Stock (determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) on such record date,
less the fair market value (as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company whose determination shall be described in a statement
filed with the Rights Agent) of the portion of the assets or evidences of indebtedness so to be distributed or of such subscription rights
or warrants applicable to one share of Common Stock, and the denominator of which shall be such current per share market price (determined
pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) of the Common Stock;
provided
,
however
, that in no event shall the consideration to be
paid upon the exercise of one Right be less than the aggregate par value of the shares of capital stock of the Company to be issued upon
exercise of one Right. Such adjustments shall be made successively whenever such a record date is fixed; and in the event that such distribution
is not so made, the Purchase Price shall again be adjusted to be the Purchase Price which would then be in effect if such record date
had not been fixed.
(d)
(i)
Except as otherwise provided herein, for the purpose of any computation hereunder, the “current per share market price” of
any security (a “Security” for the purpose of this Section 11(d)(i)) on any date shall be deemed to be the average of the
daily closing prices per share of such Security for the 30 consecutive Trading Days (as such term is hereinafter defined)
immediately prior to such date;
provided
,
however
, that in the event that the current per share market price of the
Security is determined during a period following the announcement by the issuer of such Security of (A) a dividend or distribution
on such Security payable in shares of such Security or securities convertible into such shares, or (B) any subdivision, combination
or reclassification of such Security, and prior to the expiration of 30 Trading Days after the ex-dividend date for such dividend or
distribution, or the record date for such subdivision, combination or reclassification, then, and in each such case, the current per
share market price shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect the current market price per share equivalent of such Security. The
closing price for each day shall be the last sale price, regular way, or, in case no such sale takes place on such day, the average
of the closing bid and asked prices, regular way, in either case as reported by the principal consolidated transaction reporting
system with respect to securities listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ or, if the Security is not
listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ, as reported in the principal consolidated transaction
reporting system with respect to securities listed on the principal national securities exchange on which the Security is listed or
admitted to trading or, if the Security is not listed on a national securities exchange, the last quoted price or, if not so quoted,
the average of the high and low asked prices in the over-the-counter market as reported by any system then in use, or, if not so
quoted, the average of the closing bid and asked prices as furnished by a professional market maker making a market in the Security
selected by the Board of Directors of the Company. The term “Trading Day” shall mean a day on which the principal national
securities exchange on which the Security is listed or admitted to trading is open for the transaction of business or, if the
Security is not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, a Business Day.
16
(ii) For the purpose of
any computation hereunder, if the Common Stock is publicly traded, the “current per share market price” of the Common
Stock shall be determined in accordance with the method set forth in Section 11(d)(i). If the Common Stock is not publicly traded,
“current per share market price” shall mean the fair value per share as determined by the Board of Directors of the
Company, whose determination shall be described in a statement filed with the Rights Agent.
(e)
No adjustment in the Purchase Price shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least
1% in the Purchase Price;
provided
,
however
, that any adjustments which by reason of this Section 11(e) are not required
to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent adjustment. All calculations under this Section 11 shall
be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest ten-thousandth of a share of Common Stock as the case may be. Notwithstanding the first
sentence of this Section 11(e), any adjustment required by this Section 11 shall be made no later than the earlier of (i) three years
from the date of the transaction which requires such adjustment and (ii) the Expiration Date.
(f) If as a result of an
adjustment made pursuant to Section 11(a) hereof, the holder of any Right thereafter exercised shall become entitled to receive any
shares of capital stock of the Company other than the Common Stock, thereafter the Purchase Price and the number of such other
shares so receivable upon exercise of a Right shall be subject to adjustment from time to time in a manner and on terms as nearly
equivalent as practicable to the provisions with respect to the Common Stock contained in Sections 11(a), 11(b), 11(c), 11(e),
11(h), 11(i) and 11(m) hereof, as applicable, and the provisions of Sections 7, 9, 10, 13 and 14 hereof with respect to the Common
Stock shall apply on like terms to any such other shares.
(g)
All Rights originally issued by the Company subsequent to any adjustment made to the Purchase Price hereunder shall evidence the
right to purchase, at the adjusted Purchase Price, the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable from time to time hereunder upon exercise
of the Rights, all subject to further adjustment as provided herein.
(h)
Unless the Company shall have exercised its election as provided in Section 11(i), upon each adjustment of the Purchase Price as
a result of the calculations made in Sections 11(b) and 11(c), each Right outstanding immediately prior to the making of such adjustment
shall thereafter evidence the right to purchase, at the adjusted Purchase Price, that number of shares of Common Stock (calculated to
the nearest ten-thousandth of a share of Common Stock) obtained by (i) multiplying (x) the number of shares purchasable upon the exercise
of a Right immediately prior to such adjustment by (y) the Purchase Price in effect immediately prior to such adjustment and (ii) dividing
the product so obtained by the Purchase Price in effect immediately after such adjustment.
17
(i)
The Company may elect on or after the date of any adjustment of the Purchase Price pursuant to Sections 11(b) or 11(c) hereof to
adjust the number of Rights, in substitution for any adjustment in the number of shares of Common Stock purchasable upon the exercise
of a Right. Each of the Rights outstanding after such adjustment of the number of Rights shall be exercisable for the number of shares
of Common Stock for which a Right was exercisable immediately prior to such adjustment. Each Right held of record prior to such adjustment
of the number of Rights shall become that number of Rights (calculated to the nearest ten-thousandth) obtained by dividing the Purchase
Price in effect immediately prior to adjustment of the Purchase Price by the Purchase Price in effect immediately after adjustment of
the Purchase Price. The Company shall make a public announcement of its election to adjust the number of Rights, indicating the record
date for the adjustment, and, if known at the time, the amount of the adjustment to be made. Such record date may be the date on which
the Purchase Price is adjusted or any day thereafter, but, if the Right Certificates have been issued, shall be at least 10 days later
than the date of the public announcement. If Right Certificates have been issued, upon each adjustment of the number of Rights pursuant
to this Section 11(i), the Company may, as promptly as practicable, cause to be distributed to holders of record of Right Certificates
on such record date Right Certificates evidencing, subject to Section 14 hereof, the additional Rights to which such holders shall be
entitled as a result of such adjustment, or, at the option of the Company, shall cause to be distributed to such holders of record in
substitution and replacement for the Right Certificates held by such holders prior to the date of adjustment, and upon surrender thereof,
if required by the Company, new Right Certificates evidencing all the Rights to which such holders shall be entitled after such adjustment.
Right Certificates to be so distributed shall be issued, executed and countersigned in the manner provided for herein and shall be registered
in the names of the holders of record of Right Certificates on the record date specified in the public announcement.
(j)
Irrespective of any adjustment or change in the Purchase Price or the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise
of a Right, the Right Certificates theretofore and thereafter issued may continue to express the Purchase Price and the number of shares
of Common Stock which were expressed in the initial Right Certificates issued hereunder.
(k)
Before taking any action that would cause an adjustment reducing the Purchase Price below the then par value, if any, of the shares
of Common Stock or other shares of capital stock issuable upon exercise of a Right, the Company shall take any corporate action which
may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in order that the Company may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable
shares of Common Stock or other such shares at such adjusted Purchase Price.
18
(l)
In any case in which this Section 11 shall require that an adjustment in the Purchase Price be made effective as of a record date
for a specified event, the Company may elect to defer until the occurrence of such event issuing to the holder of any Right exercised
after such record date the Common Stock and other capital stock or securities of the Company, if any, issuable upon such exercise over
and above the Common Stock and other capital stock or securities of the Company, if any, issuable upon such exercise on the basis of the
Purchase Price in effect prior to such adjustment;
provided
,
however
, that the Company shall deliver to such holder a due
bill or other appropriate instrument evidencing such holder’s right to receive such additional shares upon the occurrence of the event
requiring such adjustment.
(m)
Anything in this Section 11 to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company shall be entitled to make such adjustments in the Purchase
Price, in addition to those adjustments expressly required by this Section 11, as and to the extent that it in its sole discretion shall
determine to be advisable in order that any consolidation or subdivision of the Common Stock, issuance wholly for cash of any shares of
Common Stock at less than the current market price, issuance wholly for cash of Common Stock or securities which by their terms are convertible
into or exchangeable for Common Stock, dividends on Common Stock payable in shares of Common Stock or issuance of rights, options or warrants
referred to hereinabove in Section 11(b), hereafter made by the Company to holders of its Common Stock shall not be taxable to such stockholders.
(n)
Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in the event that at any time after the date of this Agreement and
prior to the Distribution Date, the Company shall (i) declare and pay any dividend on the Common Stock payable in Common Stock, or (ii)
effect a subdivision, combination or consolidation of the Common Stock (by reclassification or otherwise than by payment of a dividend
payable in Common Stock) into a greater or lesser number of shares of Common Stock, then, in each such case, the number of Rights associated
with each share of Common Stock then outstanding, or issued or delivered thereafter, shall be proportionately adjusted so that the number
of Rights thereafter associated with each share of Common Stock following any such event shall equal the result obtained by multiplying
the number of Rights associated with each share of Common Stock immediately prior to such event by a fraction the numerator of which shall
be the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the occurrence of such event and the denominator of which
shall be the total number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately following the occurrence of such event.
(o)
The Company agrees that, after the earlier of the Distribution Date or the Stock Acquisition Date, it will not, except as permitted
by Sections 23, 24 or 27 hereof, take (or permit any Subsidiary to take) any action if at the time such action is taken it is reasonably
foreseeable that such action will diminish substantially or eliminate the benefits intended to be afforded by the Rights.
19
Section 12.
Certificate of
Adjusted Purchase Price or Number of Shares
. Whenever an adjustment is made as provided in Section 11 or 13 hereof, the Company shall
promptly (a) prepare a certificate setting forth such adjustment, and a brief statement of the facts accounting for such adjustment, (b)
file with the Rights Agent and with each transfer agent for the Common Stock a copy of such certificate and (c) mail a brief summary thereof
to each holder of a Right Certificate in accordance with Section 25 hereof (if so required under Section 25 hereof). Notwithstanding the
foregoing sentence, the failure of the Company to make such certification or give such notice shall not affect the validity of such adjustment
or the force or effect of the requirement for such adjustment. The Rights Agent shall be fully protected in relying on any such certificate
and on any adjustment therein contained and shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any such adjustment unless and until it shall have
received such certificate.
Section 13.
Consolidation,
Merger or Sale or Transfer of Assets or Earning Power
.
(a)
In the event, directly or indirectly, at any time after the Flip-In Event (i) the Company shall consolidate with or shall
merge into any other Person, (ii) any Person shall merge with and into the Company and the Company shall be the continuing or surviving
corporation of such merger and, in connection with such merger, all or part of the Common Stock shall be changed into or exchanged for
stock or other securities of any other Person (or of the Company) or cash or any other property, or (iii) the Company shall sell or otherwise
transfer (or one or more of its Subsidiaries shall sell or otherwise transfer), in one or more transactions, assets or earning power aggregating
50% or more of the assets or earning power of the Company and its Subsidiaries (taken as a whole) to any other Person (other than the
Company or one or more wholly-owned Subsidiaries of the Company), then upon the first occurrence of such event, proper provision shall
be made so that: (A) each holder of a Right (other than Rights which have become void pursuant to Section 11(a)(ii) hereof) shall thereafter
have the right to receive, upon the exercise thereof at the Purchase Price (as theretofore adjusted in accordance with Section 11(a)(ii)
hereof), in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and in lieu of shares of Common Stock of the Company, such number of validly authorized
and issued, fully paid, non-assessable and freely tradeable shares of Common Stock of the Principal Party (as such term is hereinafter
defined), not subject to any liens, encumbrances, rights of first refusal or other adverse claims, as shall equal the result obtained
by dividing the Purchase Price (as theretofore adjusted in accordance with Section 11(a)(ii) hereof) by 50% of the current per share market
price of the Common Stock of such Principal Party (determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) on the date of consummation of such consolidation,
merger, sale or transfer;
provided
,
however
, that the Purchase Price (as theretofore adjusted in accordance with Section
11(a)(ii) hereof) and the number of shares of Common Stock of such Principal Party so receivable upon exercise of a Right shall be subject
to further adjustment as appropriate in accordance with Section 11(f) hereof to reflect any events occurring in respect of the Common
Stock of such Principal Party after the occurrence of such consolidation, merger, sale or transfer; (B) such Principal Party shall thereafter
be liable for, and shall assume, by virtue of such consolidation, merger, sale or transfer, all the obligations and duties of the Company
pursuant to this Agreement; (C) the term “Company” shall thereafter be deemed to refer to such Principal Party; and (D) such
Principal Party shall take such steps (including, but not limited to, the reservation of a sufficient number of its shares of Common Stock
in accordance with Section 9 hereof) in connection with such consummation of any such transaction as may be necessary to assure that the
provisions hereof shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in relation to the shares of its Common Stock thereafter
deliverable upon the exercise of the Rights; provided that, upon the subsequent occurrence of any consolidation, merger, sale or transfer
of assets or other extraordinary transaction in respect of such Principal Party, each holder of a Right shall thereupon be entitled to
receive, upon exercise of a Right and payment of the Purchase Price as provided in this Section 13(a), such cash, shares, rights, warrants
and other property which such holder would have been entitled to receive had such holder, at the time of such transaction, owned the Common
Stock of the Principal Party receivable upon the exercise of a Right pursuant to this Section 13(a), and such Principal Party shall take
such steps (including, but not limited to, reservation of shares of Common Stock) as may be necessary to permit the subsequent exercise
of the Rights in accordance with the terms hereof for such cash, shares, rights, warrants and other property.
20
(b)
“Principal Party” shall mean:
(i)
in the case of any transaction described in (i) or (ii) of the first sentence of Section 13(a) hereof: (A) the Person that is the
issuer of the securities into which the shares of Common Stock are converted in such merger or consolidation, or, if there is more than
one such issuer, the issuer of the shares of Common Stock of which have the greatest aggregate market value of shares outstanding, or
(B) if no securities are so issued, (x) the Person that is the other party to the merger, if such Person survives said merger, or, if
there is more than one such Person, the Person the shares of Common Stock of which have the greatest aggregate market value of shares
outstanding or (y) if the Person that is the other party to the merger does not survive the merger, the Person that does survive the merger
(including the Company if it survives) or (z) the Person resulting from the consolidation; and
(ii)
in the case of any transaction described in (iii) of the first sentence of Section 13(a) hereof, the Person that is the party receiving
the greatest portion of the assets or earning power transferred pursuant to such transaction or transactions, or, if each Person that
is a party to such transaction or transactions receives the same portion of the assets or earning power so transferred or if the Person
receiving the greatest portion of the assets or earning power cannot be determined, whichever of such Persons is the issuer of Common
Stock having the greatest aggregate market value of shares outstanding;
provided
,
however
, that in any such
case described in the foregoing clause (b)(i) or (b)(ii), if the Common Stock of such Person is not at such time or has not been continuously
over the preceding 12-month period registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, then (1) if such Person is a direct or indirect Subsidiary
of another Person the Common Stock of which is and has been so registered, the term “Principal Party” shall refer to such other
Person, or (2) if such Person is a Subsidiary, directly or indirectly, of more than one Person, the Common Stock of all of which is and
has been so registered, the term “Principal Party” shall refer to whichever of such Persons is the issuer of Common Stock having
the greatest aggregate market value of shares outstanding, or (3) if such Person is owned, directly or indirectly, by a joint venture
formed by two or more Persons that are not owned, directly or indirectly, by the same Person, the rules set forth in clauses (1) and (2)
above shall apply to each of the owners having an interest in the venture as if the Person owned by the joint venture was a Subsidiary
of both or all of such joint venturers, and the Principal Party in each such case shall bear the obligations set forth in this Section
13 in the same ratio as its interest in such Person bears to the total of such interests.
21
(c)
The Company shall not consummate any consolidation, merger, sale or transfer referred to in Section 13(a) hereof unless prior thereto
the Company and the Principal Party involved therein shall have executed and delivered to the Rights Agent an agreement confirming that
the requirements of Sections 13(a) and (b) hereof shall promptly be performed in accordance with their terms and that such consolidation,
merger, sale or transfer of assets shall not result in a default by the Principal Party under this Agreement as the same shall have been
assumed by the Principal Party pursuant to Sections 13(a) and (b) hereof and providing that, as soon as practicable after executing such
agreement pursuant to this Section 13, the Principal Party will:
(i) prepare and file a registration
statement under the Securities Act, if necessary, with respect to the Rights and the securities purchasable upon exercise of the Rights
on an appropriate form, use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to become effective as soon as practicable after such
filing and use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to remain effective (with a prospectus at all times meeting the
requirements of the Securities Act) until the Expiration Date and similarly comply with applicable state securities laws;
(ii) use its best efforts,
if the Common Stock of the Principal Party shall be listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ or on another
national securities exchange, to list or admit to trading (or continue the listing of) the Rights and the securities purchasable upon
exercise of the Rights on the New York Stock Exchange or such securities exchange, or, if the Common Stock of the Principal Party shall
not be listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange, NASDAQ or a national securities exchange, to cause the Rights and
the securities receivable upon exercise of the Rights to be authorized for quotation on any other system then in use;
(iii) deliver to holders of
the Rights historical financial statements for the Principal Party which comply in all respects with the requirements for registration
on Form 10 (or any successor form) under the Exchange Act; and
(iv) obtain waivers of any
rights of first refusal or preemptive rights in respect of the Common Stock of the Principal Party subject to purchase upon exercise
of outstanding Rights.
22
(d)
In case the Principal Party has a provision in any of its authorized securities or in its certificate of incorporation or by-laws
or other instrument governing its affairs, which provision would have the effect of (i) causing such Principal Party to issue (other than
to holders of Rights pursuant to this Section 13), in connection with, or as a consequence of, the consummation of a transaction referred
to in this Section 13, shares of Common Stock of such Principal Party at less than the then current market price per share thereof (determined
pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) or securities exercisable for, or convertible into, Common Stock of such Principal Party at less than
such then current market price, or (ii) providing for any special payment, tax or similar provision in connection with the issuance of
the Common Stock of such Principal Party pursuant to the provisions of Section 13, then, in such event, the Company hereby agrees with
each holder of Rights that it shall not consummate any such transaction unless prior thereto the Company and such Principal Party shall
have executed and delivered to the Rights Agent a supplemental agreement providing that the provision in question of such Principal Party
shall have been canceled, waived or amended, or that the authorized securities shall be redeemed, so that the applicable provision will
have no effect in connection with, or as a consequence of, the consummation of the proposed transaction.
(e)
The Company covenants and agrees that it shall not, at any time after the Flip-In Event, enter into any transaction of the type
described in clauses (i) through (iii) of Section 13(a) hereof if (i) at the time of or immediately after such consolidation, merger,
sale, transfer or other transaction there are any rights, warrants or other instruments or securities outstanding or agreements in effect
which would substantially diminish or otherwise eliminate the benefits intended to be afforded by the Rights, (ii) prior to, simultaneously
with or immediately after such consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or other transaction, the stockholders of the Person who constitutes,
or would constitute, the Principal Party for purposes of Section 13(b) hereof shall have received a distribution of Rights previously
owned by such Person or any of its Affiliates or Associates or (iii) the form or nature of organization of the Principal Party would preclude
or limit the exercisability of the Rights.
(f)
Notwithstanding
anything contained herein to the contrary, in the event of any merger or other acquisition transaction involving the Company pursuant
to a merger or other acquisition agreement between the Company and any Person (or one or more of such Person’s Affiliates or Associates)
which agreement has been approved by the Board of Directors prior to any Person becoming an Acquiring Person, this Agreement and the
rights of holders of Rights hereunder shall be terminated in accordance with Section 7(a).
Section 14.
Fractional Rights
and Fractional Shares
.
(a)
The Company shall not be required to issue fractions of Rights (except prior to the Distribution Date in accordance with Section
11(n) hereof) or to distribute Right Certificates which evidence fractional Rights. In lieu of such fractional Rights, there shall be
paid to the registered holders of the Right Certificates with regard to which such fractional Rights would otherwise be issuable, an amount
in cash equal to the same fraction of the current market value of a whole Right. For the purposes of this Section 14(a), the current market
value of a whole Right shall be the closing price of the Rights for the Trading Day immediately prior to the date on which such fractional
Rights would have been otherwise issuable. The closing price for any day shall be the last sale price, regular way, or, in case no such
sale takes place on such day, the average of the closing bid and asked prices, regular way, in either case as reported in the principal
consolidated transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ
or, if the Rights are not listed or admitted to trading on the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ, as reported in the principal consolidated
transaction reporting system with respect to securities listed on the principal national securities exchange on which the Rights are listed
or admitted to trading or, if the Rights are not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities exchange, the last quoted price
or, if not so quoted, the average of the high bid and low asked prices in the over-the-counter market, as reported by any system then
in use or, if on any such date the Rights are not quoted by any such organization, the average of the closing bid and asked prices as
furnished by a professional market maker making a market in the Rights selected by the Board of Directors of the Company. If on any such
date no such market maker is making a market in the Rights, the fair value of the Rights on such date as determined by the Board of Directors
of the Company shall be used.
23
(b)
The Company shall not be required to issue fractions of shares of Common Stock or to distribute certificates which evidence fractional
shares of Common Stock upon the exercise or exchange of Rights. In lieu of such fractional shares of Common Stock, the Company shall pay
to the registered holders of the Right Certificates with regard to which such fractional shares of Common Stock would otherwise be issuable
an amount in cash equal to the same fraction of the current market value of a whole share of Common Stock. For purposes of this Section
14(b), the current market value of one share of Common Stock for which a Right is exercisable shall be deemed to be the closing price
of one share of Common Stock (as determined in accordance with Section 11(d)(i) hereof), for the Trading Day immediately prior to the
date of such exercise.
(c)
The holder of a Right by the acceptance of the Right expressly waives his right to receive any fractional Rights or any fractional
shares upon exercise or exchange of a Right (except as provided above).
Section 15.
Rights of Action
.
All rights of action in respect of this Agreement, excepting the rights of action given to the Rights Agent under Section 18 hereof, are
vested in the respective registered holders of the Right Certificates (and, prior to the Distribution Date, the registered holders of
the Common Stock); and any registered holder of any Right Certificate (or, prior to the Distribution Date, of the Common Stock), without
the consent of the Rights Agent or of the holder of any other Right Certificate (or, prior to the Distribution Date, of the Common Stock),
on his own behalf and for his own benefit, may enforce, and may institute and maintain any suit, action or proceeding against the Company
to enforce, or otherwise act in respect of, his right to exercise the Rights evidenced by such Right Certificate (or, prior to the Distribution
Date, such Common Stock) in the manner provided therein and in this Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing or any remedies available
to the holders of Rights, it is specifically acknowledged that the holders of Rights would not have an adequate remedy at law for any
breach of this Agreement and will be entitled to specific performance of the obligations under, and injunctive relief against actual or
threatened violations of, the obligations of any Person subject to this Agreement.
24
Section 16.
Agreement of
Right Holders
. Every holder of a Right, by accepting the same, consents and agrees with the Company and the Rights Agent and with
every other holder of a Right that:
(a)
prior to the Distribution Date, the Rights will be transferable only in connection with the transfer of the Common Stock;
(b)
after the Distribution Date, the Right Certificates are transferable only on the registry books of the Rights Agent if surrendered
at the office or agency of the Rights Agent designated for such purpose, duly endorsed or accompanied by a proper instrument of transfer;
and
(c)
the Company and the Rights Agent may deem and treat the Person in whose name the Right Certificate (or, prior to the Distribution
Date, the Common Stock certificate (or Book Entry shares in respect of Common Stock)) is registered as the absolute owner thereof and
of the Rights evidenced thereby (notwithstanding any notations of ownership or writing on the Right Certificates or the Common Stock certificate
(or notices provided to holders of Book Entry shares of Common Stock) made by anyone other than the Company or the Rights Agent) for all
purposes whatsoever, and neither the Company nor the Rights Agent, subject to Section 7(e) hereof, shall be affected by any notice to
the contrary.
Section 17.
Right Certificate
Holder Not Deemed a Stockholder
. No holder, as such, of any Right Certificate shall be entitled to vote, receive dividends or be deemed
for any purpose the holder of the Common Stock or any other securities of the Company which may at any time be issuable on the exercise
or exchange of the Rights represented thereby, nor shall anything contained herein or in any Right Certificate be construed to confer
upon the holder of any Right Certificate, as such, any of the rights of a stockholder of the Company or any right to vote for the election
of directors or upon any matter submitted to stockholders at any meeting thereof, or to give or withhold consent to any corporate action,
or to receive notice of meetings or other actions affecting stockholders (except as provided in this Agreement), or to receive dividends
or subscription rights, or otherwise, until the Rights evidenced by such Right Certificate shall have been exercised or exchanged in accordance
with the provisions hereof.
Section 18.
Concerning the
Rights Agent
.
(a)
The Company agrees to pay to the Rights Agent reasonable compensation for all services rendered by it hereunder and, from time
to time, on demand of the Rights Agent, its reasonable expenses and counsel fees and other disbursements incurred in the administration
and execution of this Agreement and the exercise and performance of its duties hereunder. The Company also agrees to indemnify the Rights
Agent for, and to hold it harmless against, any loss, liability or expense, incurred without gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct
on the part of the Rights Agent, for anything done or omitted by the Rights Agent in connection with the acceptance and administration
of this Agreement, including the costs and expenses of defending against any claim of liability arising therefrom, directly or indirectly.
25
(b)

it in connection with, its administration of this Agreement in reliance upon any Right Certificate or certificate representing the Common
Stock or any other securities of the Company, instrument of assignment or transfer, power of attorney, endorsement, affidavit, letter,
notice, direction, consent, certificate, statement or other paper or document believed by it to be genuine and to be signed, executed
and, where necessary, verified or acknowledged, by the proper Person or Persons, or otherwise upon the advice of counsel as set forth
in Section 20 hereof.
Section 19.
Merger or Consolidation
or Change of Name of Rights Agent
.
(a)
Any entity into which the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent may be merged or with which it may be consolidated, or any
entity resulting from any merger or consolidation to which the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent shall be a party, or any entity
succeeding to the stock transfer or corporate trust powers of the Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent, shall be the successor to
the Rights Agent under this Agreement without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties
hereto; provided that such entity would be eligible for appointment as a successor Rights Agent under the provisions of Section 21 hereof.
In case at the time such successor Rights Agent shall succeed to the agency created by this Agreement, any of the Right Certificates shall
have been countersigned but not delivered, any such successor Rights Agent may adopt the countersignature of the predecessor Rights Agent
and deliver such Right Certificates so countersigned; and in case at that time any of the Right Certificates shall not have been countersigned,
any successor Rights Agent may countersign such Right Certificates either in the name of the predecessor Rights Agent or in the name of
the successor Rights Agent; and in all such cases such Right Certificates shall have the full force provided in the Right Certificates
and in this Agreement.
(b)
In case at any time the name of the Rights Agent shall be changed and at such time any of the Right Certificates shall have been
countersigned but not delivered, the Rights Agent may adopt the countersignature under its prior name and deliver Right Certificates so
countersigned; and in case at that time any of the Right Certificates shall not have been countersigned, the Rights Agent may countersign
such Right Certificates either in its prior name or in its changed name and in all such cases such Right Certificates shall have the full
force provided in the Right Certificates and in this Agreement.
26
Section 20.
Duties of Rights
Agent
. The Rights Agent undertakes the duties and obligations expressly set forth in this Agreement and no implied duties or obligations
shall be read into this Agreement against the Rights Agent. The Rights Agent shall perform those duties and obligations upon the following
terms and conditions, by all of which the Company and the holders of Right Certificates, by their acceptance thereof, shall be bound:
(a)
The Rights Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be legal counsel for the Company), and the opinion of such counsel shall
be full and complete authorization and protection to the Rights Agent as to any action taken or omitted by it in good faith and in accordance
with such opinion.
(b)
Whenever in the performance of its duties under this Agreement the Rights Agent shall deem it necessary or desirable that any fact
or matter be proved or established by the Company prior to taking or suffering any action hereunder, such fact or matter (unless other
evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically prescribed) may be deemed to be conclusively proved and established by a certificate
signed by the President, the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Administrative Officer, the Treasurer, the
Secretary of the Company or any other duly authorized officer of the Company and delivered to the Rights Agent; and such certificate shall
be full authorization to the Rights Agent for any action taken or suffered in good faith by it under the provisions of this Agreement
in reliance upon such certificate.
(c)
The Rights Agent shall be liable hereunder only for its own gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct.
(d)
The Rights Agent shall not be liable for or by reason of any of the statements of fact or recitals contained in this Agreement
or in the Right Certificates (except its countersignature thereof) or be required to verify the same, but all such statements and recitals
are and shall be deemed to have been made by the Company only.
(e)
The Rights Agent shall not be under any responsibility in respect of the validity of this Agreement or the execution and delivery
hereof (except the due execution hereof by the Rights Agent) or in respect of the validity or execution of any Right Certificate (except
its countersignature thereof); nor shall it be responsible for any breach by the Company of any covenant or condition contained in this
Agreement or in any Right Certificate; nor shall it be responsible for any change in the exercisability of the Rights (including the Rights
becoming void pursuant to Section 11(a)(ii) hereof) or any adjustment in the terms of the Rights provided for in Sections 3, 11, 13, 23
and 24, or the ascertaining of the existence of facts that would require any such change or adjustment (except with respect to the exercise
of Rights evidenced by Right Certificates after receipt of a certificate furnished pursuant to Section 12, describing such change or adjustment);
nor shall it by any act hereunder be deemed to make any representation or warranty as to the authorization or reservation of any shares
of Common Stock or other securities to be issued pursuant to this Agreement or any Right Certificate or as to whether any shares of Common
Stock or other securities will, when issued, be validly authorized and issued, fully paid and nonassessable.
(f)
The Company agrees that it will perform, execute, acknowledge and deliver or cause to be performed, executed, acknowledged and
delivered all such further and other acts, instruments and assurances as may reasonably be required by the Rights Agent for the carrying
out or performing by the Rights Agent of the provisions of this Agreement.
27
(g)
The Rights Agent is hereby authorized and directed to accept instructions with respect to the performance of its duties hereunder
from any person reasonably believed by the Rights Agent to be one of the President, the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer,
the Chief Administrative Officer, the Treasurer, the Secretary of the Company or any other duly authorized officer of the Company, and
to apply to such officers for advice or instructions in connection with its duties, and it shall not be liable for any action taken or
suffered by it in good faith in accordance with instructions of any such officer or for any delay in acting while waiting for those instructions.
Any application by the Rights Agent for written instructions from the Company may, at the option of the Rights Agent, set forth in writing
any action proposed to be taken or omitted by the Rights Agent under this Agreement and the date on and/or after which such action shall
be taken or such omission shall be effective. The Rights Agent shall not be liable for any action taken by, or omission of, the Rights
Agent in accordance with a proposal included in any such application on or after the date specified in such application (which date shall
not be less than five Business Days after the date any officer of the Company actually receives such application unless any such officer
shall have consented in writing to an earlier date) unless, prior to taking any such action (or the effective date in the case of an omission),
the Rights Agent shall have received written instructions in response to such application specifying the action to be taken or omitted.
(h)
The Rights Agent and any stockholder, director, officer or employee of the Rights Agent may buy, sell or deal in any of the Rights
or other securities of the Company or become pecuniarily interested in any transaction in which the Company may be interested, or contract
with or lend money to the Company or otherwise act as fully and freely as though it were not Rights Agent under this Agreement. Nothing
herein shall preclude the Rights Agent from acting in any other capacity for the Company or for any other legal entity.
(i)
The Rights Agent may execute and exercise any of the rights or powers hereby vested in it or perform any duty hereunder either
itself or by or through its attorneys or agents, and the Rights Agent shall not be answerable or accountable for any act, default, neglect
or misconduct of any such attorneys or agents or for any loss to the Company resulting from any such act, default, neglect or misconduct,
provided reasonable care was exercised in the selection and continued employment thereof.
(j)
If, with respect to any Right Certificate surrendered to the Rights Agent for exercise or transfer, the certificate contained in
the form of assignment or the form of election to purchase set forth on the reverse thereof, as the case may be, has not been completed
to certify the holder is not an Acquiring Person (or an Affiliate or Associate thereof) or a transferee thereof, the Rights Agent shall
not take any further action with respect to such requested exercise or transfer without first consulting with the Company.
28
Section 21.
Change of Rights
Agent
. The Rights Agent or any successor Rights Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties under this Agreement upon 30 days’
notice in writing mailed to the Company and to each transfer agent of the Common Stock by registered or certified mail, and, following
the Distribution Date, to the holders of the Right Certificates by first-class mail. The Company may remove the Rights Agent or any successor
Rights Agent upon 30 days’ notice in writing, mailed to the Rights Agent or successor Rights Agent, as the case may be, and to each transfer
agent of the Common Stock by registered or certified mail, and, following the Distribution Date, to the holders of the Right Certificates
by first-class mail. If the Rights Agent shall resign or be removed or shall otherwise become incapable of acting, the Company shall appoint
a successor to the Rights Agent. If the Company shall fail to make such appointment within a period of 30 days after giving notice of
such removal or after it has been notified in writing of such resignation or incapacity by the resigning or incapacitated Rights Agent
or by the holder of a Right Certificate (who shall, with such notice, submit his Right Certificate for inspection by the Company), then
the registered holder of any Right Certificate may apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a new Rights Agent.
Any successor Rights Agent, whether appointed by the Company or by such a court, shall be a corporation organized and doing business under
the laws of the United States or the laws of any state of the United States or the District of Columbia, in good standing, having an office
in the State of Delaware or the State of New York, which is authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust or stock transfer powers
and is subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authority and which has at the time of its appointment as Rights Agent
a combined capital and surplus of at least $100 million. After appointment, the successor Rights Agent shall be vested with the same powers,
rights, duties and responsibilities as if it had been originally named as Rights Agent without further act or deed; but the predecessor
Rights Agent shall deliver and transfer to the successor Rights Agent any property at the time held by it hereunder, and execute and deliver
any further assurance, conveyance, act or deed necessary for the purpose. Not later than the effective date of any such appointment the
Company shall file notice thereof in writing with the predecessor Rights Agent and each transfer agent of the Common Stock, and, following
the Distribution Date, mail a notice thereof in writing to the registered holders of the Right Certificates. Failure to give any notice
provided for in this Section 21, however, or any defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of the resignation or removal
of the Rights Agent or the appointment of the successor Rights Agent, as the case may be.
Section 22.
Issuance of New
Right Certificates
. Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this Agreement or of the Rights to the contrary, the Company may, at
its option, issue new Right Certificates evidencing Rights in such forms as may be approved by its Board of Directors to reflect any adjustment
or change in the Purchase Price and the number or kind or class of shares or other securities or property purchasable under the Right
Certificates made in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement. In addition, in connection with the issuance or sale of Common
Stock following the Distribution Date and prior to the Expiration Date, the Company may with respect to shares of Common Stock so issued
or sold (i) pursuant to the exercise of stock options, (ii) under any employee plan or arrangement, (iii) upon the exercise, conversion
or exchange of securities, notes or debentures issued by the Company or (iv) pursuant to a contractual obligation of the Company, in each
case existing prior to the Distribution Date, issue Rights Certificates representing the appropriate number of Rights in connection with
such issuance or sale.
29
Section 23.
Redemption
.
(a)
The Board of Directors of the Company may, at any time prior to the Flip-In Event, redeem all but not less than all the then outstanding
Rights at a redemption price of $0.012 per Right, appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction
occurring in respect of the Common Stock after the date hereof (the redemption price being hereinafter referred to as the “Redemption
Price”). The redemption of the Rights may be made effective at such time, on such basis and with such conditions as the Board of
Directors of the Company in its sole discretion may establish. The Redemption Price shall be payable, at the option of the Company, in
cash, shares of Common Stock or such other form of consideration as the Board of Directors of the Company shall determine.
(b)
Immediately upon the action of the Board of Directors of the Company ordering the redemption of the Rights pursuant to paragraph
(a) of this Section 23 (or at such later time as the Board of Directors of the Company may establish for the effectiveness of such redemption),
and without any further action and without any notice, the right to exercise the Rights will terminate and the only right thereafter of
the holders of Rights shall be to receive the Redemption Price. The Company shall promptly give public notice of any such redemption;
provided
,
however
, that the failure to give, or any defect in, any such notice shall not affect the validity of such redemption.
Within 10 days after such action of the Board of Directors of the Company ordering the redemption of the Rights (or such later time as
the Board of Directors of the Company may establish for the effectiveness of such redemption), the Company shall mail a notice of redemption
to all the holders of the then outstanding Rights at their last addresses as they appear upon the registry books of the Rights Agent or,
prior to the Distribution Date, on the registry books of the transfer agent for the Common Stock. Any notice which is mailed in the manner
herein provided shall be deemed given, whether or not the holder receives the notice. Each such notice of redemption shall state the method
by which the payment of the Redemption Price will be made.
Section 24.
Exchange
.
(a)
The Board of Directors of the Company may, at its option, at any time after the Flip-In Event, exchange all or part of the then
outstanding Rights (which shall not include Rights that have become void pursuant to the provisions of Section 11(a)(ii) hereof) for shares
of Common Stock (or the right to receive shares of Common Stock) at an exchange ratio of one share of Common Stock (or the right to receive
shares of Common Stock) per Right, appropriately adjusted to reflect any stock split, stock dividend or similar transaction occurring
in respect of the Common Stock after the date hereof (such amount per Right being hereinafter referred to as the “Exchange Ratio”).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board of Directors of the Company shall not be empowered to effect such exchange at any time after
an Acquiring Person shall have become the Beneficial Owner of 50% or more of the shares of the Common Stock then outstanding. From and
after the occurrence of an event specified in Section 13(a) hereof, any Rights that theretofore have not been exchanged pursuant to this
Section 24(a) shall thereafter be exercisable only in accordance with Section 13 and may not be exchanged pursuant to this Section 24(a).
The exchange of the Rights by the Board of Directors of the Company may be made effective at such time, on such basis and with such conditions
as the Board of Directors of the Company in its sole discretion may establish. Prior to effecting an exchange pursuant to this Section
24, the Board of Directors of the Company may direct the Company to enter into a Trust Agreement in such form and with such terms as the
Board of Directors of the Company shall then approve (the “Trust Agreement”). If the Board of Directors of the Company so directs,
the Company shall enter into the Trust Agreement and shall issue or commit to issue to the trust created by such agreement (the “Trust”)
all of the shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant to the exchange, and all Persons entitled to receive shares pursuant to the exchange
shall be entitled to receive such shares (and any dividends or distributions made thereon after the date on which such shares are deposited
in the Trust) only from the Trust and solely upon compliance with the relevant terms and provisions of the Trust Agreement.
30
(b)
Immediately upon the effectiveness of the action of the Board of Directors of the Company ordering the exchange of any Rights pursuant
to paragraph (a) of this Section 24 and without any further action and without any notice, the right to exercise such Rights shall terminate
and the only right thereafter of a holder of such Rights shall be to receive that number of shares of Common Stock (or the right to receive
shares of Common Stock) equal to the number of such Rights held by such holder multiplied by the Exchange Ratio. The Company shall promptly
give public notice of any such exchange;
provided
,
however
, that the failure to give, or any defect in, such notice shall
not affect the validity of such exchange. The Company shall promptly mail a notice of any such exchange to all of the holders of the Rights
so exchanged at their last addresses as they appear upon the registry books of the Rights Agent. Any notice which is mailed in the manner
herein provided shall be deemed given, whether or not the holder receives the notice. Each such notice of exchange will state the method
by which the exchange of the shares of Common Stock for Rights will be effected and, in the event of any partial exchange, the number
of Rights which will be exchanged. Any partial exchange shall be effected pro rata based on the number of Rights (other than Rights which
have become void pursuant to the provisions of Section 11(a)(ii) hereof) held by each holder of Rights.
(c)
In the event that there shall not be sufficient shares of Common Stock issued but not outstanding or authorized but unissued to
permit an exchange of Rights for Common Stock as contemplated in accordance with this Section 24, the Company may commit to issue shares
of Common Stock at such time as additional authorized shares of Common Stock become available for issue or may substitute to the extent
of such insufficiency, for each share of Common Stock that would otherwise be issuable upon exchange of a Right, consideration of any
type described in Section 11(a)(iii)(A) (or any combination thereof), which consideration shall have an aggregate current per share market
price (determined pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) equal to the current per share market price of one share of Common Stock (determined
pursuant to Section 11(d) hereof) as of the date of such exchange.
Section 25.
Notice of Certain
Events
. In case any event described in Section 11(a)(ii) or Section 13 shall occur then the Company shall as soon as practicable thereafter
give to each holder of a Right Certificate (or if occurring prior to the Distribution Date, the holders of the Common Stock) in accordance
with Section 26 hereof, a notice of the occurrence of such event, which notice shall describe such event and the consequences of such
event to holders of Rights under Section 11(a)(ii) and Section 13 hereof.
