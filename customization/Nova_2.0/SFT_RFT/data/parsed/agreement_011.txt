The Administrative Agent may select information sources or services in its reasonable discretion to ascertain any reference rate referred to herein or any alternative, successor or replacement rate (including, without limitation, any Successor Rate) (or any component of any of the foregoing), in each case pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and shall have no liability to the Borrower, any Lender or any other person or entity for damages of any kind, including direct or indirect, special, punitive, incidental or consequential damages, costs, losses or expenses (whether in tort, contract or otherwise and whether at law or in equity), for any error or other action or omission related to or affecting the selection, determination, or calculation of any rate (or component thereof) provided by any such information source or service.

Timing of Payment and Performance
. When payment of any obligation or the performance of any covenant, duty or obligation is stated to be due or required on a day which is not a Business Day, the date of such payment (other than as described in the definitions of “Interest Period” and/or “Maturity Date”) or performance shall extend to the immediately
42
succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension.
ARTICLE II.
THE COMMITMENTS AND CREDIT EXTENSIONS
2.01
Term Loans
. On the Prior Closing Date, the Borrower borrowed term loans under the Existing Credit Agreement in the aggregate principal amount of $175,000,000 (collectively, the “
Original Term Loans
”). On the Restatement Effective Date, immediately prior to the effectiveness of this Agreement, the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the Original Term Loans was $175,000,000. On the Restatement Effective Date, after giving effect to this Agreement and subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, (i) the Original Term Loans shall constitute Term Loans made by the Lenders under this Agreement, (ii) each Lender severally agrees to make a Term Loan to the Borrower on the Restatement Effective Date in the amount, if any, by which such Lender’s Term Commitment as set forth on
Schedule 2.01
exceeds such Lender’s Original Term Loan and (iii) the Administrative Agent will effect a settlement among the Lenders such that after giving effect to the foregoing, the Term Loans will be held by the Lenders in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages and not exceeding their respective Term Commitments. Term Loans that are repaid or prepaid may not be reborrowed.
2.02
Borrowings, Conversions and Continuations of Loans
.
(a)
Each Borrowing, each conversion of Loans from one Type to another, and each continuation of Term SOFR Loans shall be made upon the Borrower’s irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, which may be given by telephone or a Committed Loan Notice;
provided
that any telephonic notice must be confirmed promptly by delivery to the Administrative Agent of a Committed Loan Notice. Each such Committed Loan Notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. Central time (i) three Business Days prior to the requested date of any Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Term SOFR Loans or of any conversion of Term SOFR Loans to Base Rate Loans or Daily SOFR Loans, and (ii) on the requested date of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans or Daily SOFR Loans or conversion of Base Rate Loans to Daily SOFR Loans or Daily SOFR Loans to Base Rate Loans;
provided
,
however
, that if the Borrower wishes to request Term SOFR Loans having an Interest Period other than one, three or six months, in duration as provided in the definition of “Interest Period,” the applicable notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. Central time four Business Days prior to the requested date of such Borrowing, conversion or continuation, whereupon the Administrative Agent shall give prompt notice to the Lenders of such request and determine whether the requested Interest Period is acceptable to all of them. Not later than 11:00 a.m. Central time, three Business Days before the requested date of such Borrowing, conversion or continuation, the Administrative Agent shall notify the Borrower (which notice may be by telephone) whether or not the requested Interest Period has been consented to by all the Lenders. Each Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Term SOFR Loans shall be in a minimum principal amount of $5,000,000. Each Borrowing of or conversion to Base Rate Loans and Daily SOFR Loans shall be in a minimum principal amount of $500,000. Each Committed Loan Notice shall specify (i) whether the Borrower is requesting
43
a Borrowing, a conversion of, Loans from one Type to another, or a continuation of Term SOFR Loans, (ii) the requested date of the Borrowing, conversion or continuation, as the case may be (which shall be a Business Day), (iii) the principal amount of Loans to be borrowed, converted or continued, (iv) the Type of Loans to be borrowed or continued or to which existing Loans are to be converted and (v) if applicable, the duration of the Interest Period with respect thereto. If the Borrower fails to specify a Type of Loan in a Committed Loan Notice or if the Borrower fails to give a timely notice requesting a conversion or continuation, then the applicable Loans shall be made as, or converted to, Daily SOFR Loans. Any automatic conversion of Term SOFR Loans to Daily SOFR Loans shall be effective as of the last day of the Interest Period then in effect with respect to such Term SOFR Loans.
If the Borrower requests a Borrowing of, conversion to, or continuation of Term SOFR Loans in any such Committed Loan Notice, but fails to specify an Interest Period, it will be deemed to have specified an Interest Period of one month.
(b)
Following receipt of a Committed Loan Notice requesting a Borrowing, the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Lender of the amount of its Applicable Percentage of the applicable Loans, and if no timely notice of a conversion or continuation is provided by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the details of any automatic conversion to Daily SOFR Loans described in
Section 2.02(a)
. In the case of a Borrowing, each Lender shall make the amount of its Loan available to the Administrative Agent in immediately available funds at the Principal Office not later than 1:00 p.m. Central time on the Business Day specified in the applicable Committed Loan Notice. Subject to fulfillment of all applicable conditions set forth in
Section 4.02
(and if such Borrowing is the initial Credit Extension,
Section 4.01
), the Administrative Agent shall make available to the Borrower in the account specified by the Borrower in the Disbursement Instruction Agreement on the Restatement Effective Date, the proceeds of such amounts received by the Administrative Agent.
(c)
Except as otherwise provided herein, a Term SOFR Loan may be continued or converted only on the last day of an Interest Period for such Term SOFR Loan. During the existence of a Default, no Loan may be requested as, converted to or continued as a Term SOFR Loan without the consent of the Required Lenders.
(d)
The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the interest rate applicable to any Interest Period for a Term SOFR Loan upon determination of such interest rate.
(e)
After giving effect to all Borrowings, all conversions of Loans from one Type to another, and all continuations of Loans as the same Type, there shall not be more than eight (8) Interest Periods in effect with respect to all Loans.
(f)
With respect to SOFR, Daily Simple SOFR, Term SOFR or any Successor Rate, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document; provided that, with respect to any such amendment effected, the Administrative Agent shall post each such
44
amendment implementing such Conforming Changes to the Borrower and the Lenders reasonably promptly after such amendment becomes effective
(g)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, any Lender may exchange, continue or rollover all or a portion of its Loans in connection with any refinancing, extension, loan modification or similar transaction permitted by the terms of this Agreement, pursuant to a cashless settlement mechanism approved by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, and such Lender.

provided
that (i) such notice must be received by the Administrative Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. Central time (A) three Business Days prior to any date of prepayment of Term SOFR Loans and (B) on the date of prepayment of Base Rate Loans or Daily SOFR Loans; (ii) any prepayment of Term SOFR Loans shall be in a principal amount of $3,000,000; and (iii) any prepayment of Base Rate Loans or Daily SOFR Loans shall be in a principal amount of $500,000 or, in each case, if less, the entire principal amount thereof then outstanding; provided that a notice of prepayment may state that such notice is conditioned upon the effectiveness of other credit facilities or any other transaction or event, in which case such notice may be revoked by the Borrower if such condition is not satisfied. Each such notice shall specify (x) the date and amount of such prepayment, (y) the Type(s) of Loans to be prepaid and, (z) if Term SOFR Loans are to be prepaid, the Interest Period(s) of such Term SOFR Loans. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify each Lender of its receipt of each such notice, and of the amount of such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of such prepayment. If such notice is given by the Borrower, the Borrower shall make such prepayment and the payment amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date specified therein. Any prepayment of a Term SOFR Loan shall be accompanied by all accrued interest on the amount prepaid, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to
Section 3.05

2.09
Interest
.
(a)
Subject to the provisions of
subsection (b)
below, (i) each Term SOFR Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof for each Interest Period at a rate per annum equal to Term SOFR for such Interest Period
plus
the Applicable Rate; (ii) each Base
45
Rate Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to the Base Rate
plus
the Applicable Rate; and (iii) each Daily SOFR Loan shall bear interest on the outstanding principal amount thereof from the applicable borrowing date at a rate per annum equal to Daily Simple SOFR
plus
the Applicable Rate.
(b)
While any Event of Default exists under
Section 8.01(a)(i)
or
(f)
, the Borrower shall pay interest on the principal amount of all outstanding Obligations hereunder at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws.
(c)
Upon the request of the Required Lenders, while any Event of Default exists (other than as set forth in
clause (b)
above), the Borrower shall pay interest on the principal amount of all outstanding Obligations hereunder at a fluctuating interest rate per annum at all times equal to the Default Rate to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Laws.
(d)
Accrued and unpaid interest on past due amounts (including interest on past due interest) shall be due and payable upon demand.
(e)
All accrued and unpaid interest on the outstanding principal amount of each Loan shall be payable (i) monthly in arrears on the first day of each month, commencing with the first full calendar month occurring after the Restatement Effective Date and (ii) on any date on which the principal balance of such Loan is due and payable in full (whether at maturity, due to acceleration or otherwise). Interest hereunder shall be due and payable in accordance with the terms hereof before and after judgment, and before and after the commencement of any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Law.
2.10
Fees
.
(a)
The Borrower shall pay to the Arrangers and the Administrative Agent for their own respective accounts fees in the amounts and at the times specified in the Fee Letters. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason.
(b)
The Borrower shall pay to the Lenders such fees as shall have been separately agreed upon in writing in the amounts and at the times so specified. Such fees shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason whatsoever.
2.11
Computation of Interest and Fees; Retroactive Adjustments of Applicable Rate
.
(a)
All computations of interest for Base Rate Loans (including Base Rate Loans determined by reference to Term SOFR) shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 or 366 days, as the case may be, and actual days elapsed. All other computations of fees and interest, including those with respect to Daily SOFR Loans, shall be made on the basis of a 360-day year and actual days elapsed (which results in more fees or interest, as applicable, being paid than if computed on the basis of a 365-day year). Interest shall accrue on each Loan for the day on
46
which the Loan is made, and shall not accrue on a Loan, or any portion thereof, for the day on which the Loan or such portion is paid,
provided
that any Loan that is repaid on the same day on which it is made shall, subject to
Section 2.13(a)
, bear interest for one day. Each determination by the Administrative Agent of an interest rate or fee hereunder shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.
(b)    If, as a result of any restatement of or other adjustment to the financial statements of the Parent, or for any other reason, (i) the ratio of Total Indebtedness to Total Asset Value as calculated by the Loan Parties as of any applicable date was inaccurate and (ii) a proper calculation of Total Indebtedness to Total Asset Value would have resulted in higher pricing for such period, the Borrower shall immediately and retroactively be obligated to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the applicable Lenders promptly on demand by the Administrative Agent (or, after the occurrence of an actual or deemed entry of an order for relief with respect to the Parent or any other Loan Party under the Bankruptcy Code of the United States, automatically and without further action by the Administrative Agent or any Lender), an amount equal to the excess of the amount of interest and fees that should have been paid for such period over the amount of interest and fees actually paid for such period. This paragraph shall not limit the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender, as the case may be, under
Section 2.09(b)
or
2.09(c)
or under
Article VIII
. The Borrower’s obligations under this paragraph shall survive the payment in full of the Obligations and the termination of this Agreement.
2.12
Evidence of Debt
. The Credit Extensions made by each Lender shall be evidenced by one or more accounts or records maintained by such Lender and by the Administrative Agent in the ordinary course of business. The accounts or records maintained by the Administrative Agent and each Lender shall be conclusive absent manifest error of the amount of the Credit Extensions made by the Lenders to the Borrower and the interest and payments thereon. Any failure to so record or any error in doing so shall not, however, limit or otherwise affect the obligation of the Borrower hereunder to pay any amount owing with respect to the Obligations. In the event of any conflict between the accounts and records maintained by any Lender and the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent in respect of such matters, the accounts and records of the Administrative Agent shall control in the absence of manifest error.
Upon the request of any Lender made through the Administrative Agent, the Borrower shall execute and deliver to such Lender (through the Administrative Agent) Notes that evidence such Lender’s Loans in addition to such accounts or records. Each Lender may attach schedules to its Notes and endorse thereon the date, Type (if applicable), amount and maturity of its applicable Loans and payments with respect thereto.
2.13
Payments Generally; Administrative Agent’s Clawback
.
(a)
General
. All payments to be made by the Borrower shall be made free and clear of and without condition or deduction for any counterclaim, defense, recoupment or setoff. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all payments by the Borrower hereunder shall be made to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the respective Lenders to which such payment is owed, at the Principal Office in Dollars and in immediately available funds not later
47
than 1:00 p.m. Central time on the date specified herein. The Administrative Agent will promptly distribute to each Lender its Applicable Percentage (or other applicable share as provided herein) of such payment in like funds as received by wire transfer to such Lender’s Lending Office. All payments received by the Administrative Agent after 1:00 p.m. Central time shall be deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and any applicable interest or fee shall continue to accrue. If any payment to be made by the Borrower shall come due on a day other than a Business Day, payment shall be made on the next following Business Day, and such extension of time shall be reflected in computing interest or fees, as the case may be.
(b)
(i)
Funding of Loans by Lenders; Presumption by Administrative Agent
. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed date of any Borrowing of Term SOFR Loans (or, in the case of any Borrowing of Base Rate Loans or Daily SOFR Loans, prior to 12:00 noon Central time on the date of such Borrowing) that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with
Section 2.02
(or, in the case of a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans or Daily SOFR Loans, that such Lender has made such share available in accordance with and at the time required by
Section 2.02
) and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Borrower severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand such corresponding amount in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Borrower to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (A) in the case of a payment to be made by such Lender, the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation, plus any administrative, processing or similar fees customarily charged by the Administrative Agent in connection with the foregoing, and (B) in the case of a payment to be made by the Borrower, the interest rate applicable to Base Rate Loans. If the Borrower and such Lender shall pay such interest to the Administrative Agent for the same or an overlapping period, the Administrative Agent shall promptly remit to the Borrower the amount of such interest paid by the Borrower for such period. If such Lender pays its share of the applicable Borrowing to the Administrative Agent, then the amount so paid shall constitute such Lender’s Loan included in such Borrowing. Any payment by the Borrower shall be without prejudice to any claim the Borrower may have against a Lender that shall have failed to make such payment to the Administrative Agent.
(i)
Payments by the Borrower; Presumptions by Administrative Agent
. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from the Borrower prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Lenders the amount due.
48
(ii)
With respect to any payment that the Administrative Agent makes for the account of the Lenders hereunder as to which the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that any of the following applies (such payment referred to as the “
Rescindable Amount
”): (1) the Borrower has not in fact made such payment; (2) the Administrative Agent has made a payment in excess of the amount so paid by the Borrower (whether or not then owed); or (3) the Administrative Agent has for any reason otherwise erroneously made such payment; then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand the Rescindable Amount so distributed to such Lender in immediately available funds with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the Federal Funds Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
A notice of the Administrative Agent to any Lender or the Borrower with respect to any amount owing under this
subsection (b)
shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.
(c)
Failure to Satisfy Conditions Precedent
. If any Lender makes available to the Administrative Agent funds for any Loan to be made by such Lender as provided in the foregoing provisions of this
Article II
, and such funds are not made available to the Borrower by the Administrative Agent because the conditions to the applicable Credit Extension set forth in
Article IV
are not satisfied or waived in accordance with the terms hereof, the Administrative Agent shall return such funds (in like funds as received from such Lender) to such Lender, without interest.
(d)
Obligations of Lenders Several
. The obligations of the Lenders hereunder to make Loans and to make payments pursuant to
Section 10.04(c)
are several and not joint. The failure of any Lender to make any Loan or to make any payment under
Section 10.04(c)
on any date required hereunder shall not relieve any other Lender of its corresponding obligation to do so on such date, and no Lender shall be responsible for the failure of any other Lender to so make its Loan or to make its payment under
Section 10.04(c)
.
(e)
Funding Source
. Nothing herein shall be deemed to obligate any Lender to obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner or to constitute a representation by any Lender that it has obtained or will obtain the funds for any Loan in any particular place or manner.
2.14
Sharing of Payments by Lenders
. If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of setoff or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of the Loans made by it resulting in such Lender’s receiving payment of a proportion of the aggregate amount of such Loans and accrued interest thereon greater than its pro rata share thereof as provided herein, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall (a) notify the Administrative Agent of such fact, and (b) purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans of the other Lenders, or make such other adjustments as shall be equitable, so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance with the
49
aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans and other amounts owing them,
provided
that:
(i)
if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest; and
(ii)
the provisions of this Section shall not be construed to apply to (x) any payment made by or on behalf of the Borrower pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement (including the application of funds arising from the existence of a Defaulting Lender) or (y) any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant, other than an assignment to the Borrower or any Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this Section shall apply).
The Borrower consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Borrower or any Guarantor rights of setoff and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Borrower
or such Guarantor in the amount of such participation.
2.15
Extensions of the Maturity Date
.
(a)
Notification of Extension
. The Borrower may, by written notice to the Administrative Agent (such notice, a “
Term Facility Extension Notice
”) not earlier than 90 days and not later than 30 days prior to (i) the Initial Term Facility Maturity Date elect that the Term Lenders extend the Maturity Date for an additional twelve (12) months from the Initial Term Facility Maturity Date to the First Extended Term Facility Maturity Date and (ii) the First Extended Term Facility Maturity Date elect that the Term Lenders extend the Maturity Date for an additional twelve (12) months from the First Extended Term Facility Maturity Date to the Final Term Facility Maturity Date. The Administrative Agent shall distribute each Term Facility Extension Notice promptly to the Lenders following its receipt thereof.
(b)
Conditions Precedent to Effectiveness of an Extension of the Initial Term Facility Maturity Date
. As conditions precedent to each extension of the Maturity Date, the Borrower shall, on or prior to the then applicable Maturity Date, satisfy each of the following requirements for such extension to become effective (the first date each of such conditions precedent has been satisfied with respect to such extension being referred to herein as an “
Extension Effective Date
”):
(i)
The Administrative Agent shall have received a Term Facility Extension Notice within the period required under clause (a) above;
(ii)
On the date of such Term Facility Extension Notice and on such Extension Effective Date, both immediately before and immediately after giving effect to such extension of the Maturity Date, no Default shall have occurred and be continuing;
50
(iii)
The Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent, for the pro rata benefit of the Lenders based on their respective Applicable Percentages as of such date, an extension fee in an amount equal to 0.15% of the Term Facility as in effect on the applicable Extension Effective Date; it being agreed that each such extension fee shall be fully earned when paid and shall not be refundable for any reason;
(iv)
The Administrative Agent shall have received a certificate of the Parent dated as of the applicable Extension Effective Date signed by a Responsible Officer of the Parent (i) (x) certifying and attaching the resolutions adopted by each Loan Party approving or consenting to such extension or (y) certifying that, as of such Extension Effective Date, the resolutions delivered to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders on the Restatement Effective Date (if such resolutions included approval for an extension of the Maturity Date for a period that is not less than an additional twelve (12) months from the Initial Term Facility Maturity Date and/or not less than an additional twelve (12) months from the First Extended Term Facility Maturity Date, as applicable) are and remain in full force and effect and have not been modified, rescinded or superseded since the date of adoption and (ii) certifying that, before and after giving effect to such extension, (A) the representations and warranties contained in
Article V
or any other Loan Document, or which are contained in any document furnished at any time under or in connection herewith or therewith, are true and correct in all material respects (or, in the case of
Section 5.19
in all respects, and, in each case, without duplication of any materiality qualifiers set forth in such representations and warranties) on and as of such Extension Effective Date, except to the extent such representations and warranties relate to an earlier date or given period (in which case such representations and warranties shall have been true and correct in all material respects as of the respective date or for the respective period, as the case may be (or, in the case of
Section 5.19
in all respects, and, in each case, without duplication of any materiality qualifiers set forth in such representations and warranties)) and except that for purposes of this
Section 2.15
, the representations and warranties contained in subsections (a) and (b) of
Section 5.05
shall be deemed to refer to the most recent statements furnished pursuant to
subsections (a)
and
(b)
, respectively, of
Section 6.01
and (B) no Default exists; and
(v)
The Borrower and the other Loan Parties shall have delivered to the Administrative Agent reaffirmations of their respective obligations under the Loan Documents (after giving effect to the extension), and acknowledgments and certifications that they have no claims, offsets or defenses with respect to the payment or performance of any of the Obligations, including, without limitation, reaffirmations of the Guaranty Agreement, executed by the Loan Parties party thereto.
Conflicting Provisions
. This Section shall supersede any provisions in
Section 2.14
or
10.01
to the contrary.
2.16
Increase in Facilities
.
(a)
Request for Increase
. Provided there exists no Default, upon written notice to the Administrative Agent, the Borrower may, at any time and from time to time after the
51
Restatement Effective Date, request to increase the aggregate amount of the Facilities to an amount not exceeding $310,000,000 by requesting an increase in the Term Facility (each such increase, an “
Incremental Term Increase
”) or establishing a new (or increasing an existing) tranche of pari passu term facility (each an “
Incremental Term Loan Facility
”; each Incremental Term Loan Facility and Incremental Term Increase are collectively referred to as “
Incremental Facilities
”);
provided
that (i) each Incremental Term Increase shall be on the same terms as the Term Facility, (ii) the terms and conditions of each Incremental Term Loan Facility, subject to clause (i) of the last proviso to
Section 10.01
, if applicable, will be determined by the Borrower and the lenders under such Incremental Term Loan Facility, and if the terms of such Incremental Term Loan Facility (other than final maturity) are not the same as the terms of a then existing Incremental Term Loan Facility, the operational, technical and administrative provisions of such Incremental Term Loan Facility shall be on terms reasonably acceptable to the Administrative Agent, and (iii) the conditions to the making of a Credit Extension set forth in
Section 4.02
(other than
Section 4.02(c)
) shall be satisfied or waived. At the time of sending such notice, the Borrower (in consultation with the Administrative Agent) shall specify the time period within which each Lender is requested to respond (which shall in no event be less than ten (10) Business Days from the date of delivery of such notice to the Lenders).
(b)

Each Lender (if any) identified in such notice shall endeavor to notify the Administrative Agent within the specified period for a response whether or not it agrees to provide all or a portion of such increase and, if so, the amount of such requested increase that it proposes to provide. Any Lender approached to provide all or a portion of such increase may elect or decline, in its sole discretion, to provide all or a portion of such increase in the applicable facility offered to it. Any Lender not responding within such time period shall be deemed to have declined to provide any portion of the requested increase. Any Eligible Assignee providing any portion of the requested increase that is not an existing Lender shall become a Lender pursuant to a joinder agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and its counsel (a “
New Lender Joinder Agreement
”). The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and each Lender of the Lenders’ responses to each request made hereunder.
(c)
Increase Effective Date and Allocations

Section 5.19
in all respects, and, in each case, without duplication of any materiality qualifiers set forth in such representations and warranties)) and except that for purposes of this

2.18
Defaulting Lenders
.
(a)
Adjustments
. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as that Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable Law:
(i)
Waivers and Amendments
. Such Defaulting Lender’s right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent with respect to this Agreement shall be restricted as set forth in the definition of “Required Lenders”, and
Section 10.01
.
(ii)
Defaulting Lender Waterfall
. Any payment of principal, interest, fees or other amounts received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Defaulting Lender (whether voluntary or mandatory, at maturity, pursuant to
Article VIII
or otherwise) or received by the Administrative Agent from a Defaulting Lender pursuant to
Section 10.08
shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows:
first
, to the payment of any amounts owing by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent hereunder;
second
, as the Borrower may request (so long as no Default or Event of Default exists), to the funding of any Term Loan in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has failed to fund its portion thereof as required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent;
third
, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by any Lender against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement;
fourth
, so long as no Default or Event of Default exists, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Borrower as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Borrower against such Defaulting Lender as a result of such Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement; and
fifth
, to such Defaulting Lender or as otherwise directed by a court of competent jurisdiction;
provided
that if (x) such payment is a payment of the principal amount of any Loans in respect of which such Defaulting Lender has not fully funded its appropriate share, and (y) such Loans were made at a time when the conditions set forth in
Section 4.02
were satisfied or waived, such payment
54
shall be applied solely to pay the Loans of all Non-Defaulting Lenders on a pro rata basis prior to being applied to the payment of any Loans of such Defaulting Lender until such time as all Loans are held by the Lenders pro rata in accordance with their respective Applicable Percentages. Any payments, prepayments or other amounts paid or payable to a Defaulting Lender that are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender shall be deemed paid to and redirected by such Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.
(b)
Defaulting Lender Cure
.
If the Borrower and the Administrative Agent agree in writing that a Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and, subject to any conditions set forth therein, that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase at par that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans to be held on a pro rata basis by the Lenders in accordance with their Applicable Percentages, whereupon such Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender;
provided
that no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Borrower while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender; and
provided
,
further
, that except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender’s having been a Defaulting Lender.
2.19
Term Hedged Portion
. In order to accommodate the establishment of differing rate floors for the portion of the Term Loan or an Incremental Term Loan Facility for which the Borrower has entered into a Swap Contract that provides a hedge against interest rate risk and the portion of the Term Loan or an Incremental Term Loan Facility for which the Borrower has not entered into a Swap Contract that provides a hedge against interest rate risk, the Term Loan and any such Incremental Term Loan Facility will be identified in two parts as the Term Hedged Portion and the Term Unhedged Portion. On the Restatement Effective Date, each Term Lender holds each of the Term Hedged Portion and the Term Unhedged Portion of the Term Loan ratably in accordance with such Term Lender’s Applicable Percentage of the Term Loan as set forth on
Schedule 2.01
(as the same may be updated from time to time by Administrative Agent after receipt of a Hedge Change Notice). Other than with respect to the differing rate floors, the Interest Periods and all other payment and interest terms applicable to the Term Loan or any applicable Incremental Term Loan Facility will be applicable to the Term Hedged Portion and the Term Unhedged Portion with respect thereto. The Borrower will provide the Administrative Agent written notice within five (5) Business Days after any change in the amount of the Term Loan or any Incremental Term Loan Facility for which the Borrower has entered into a Swap Contract that provided a hedge against interest rate risk (a “
Hedge Change Notice
”). The Administrative Agent will, if it deems necessary, then adjust the Register and
Schedule 2.01
in the amount of the Term Hedged Portion and Term Unhedged Portion in accordance with such notice as soon as administratively feasible. If, as a result of the Borrower’s failure to deliver a Hedge Change Notice to the Administrative Agent for any reason, the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders determine that a delivery of a Hedge Change Notice would have resulted in higher pricing for such period as a result of a higher interest rate floor, the Borrower shall,
55
retroactively to the date that the Hedge Change Notice should have been delivered, be obligated to pay to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Term Lenders or the Lenders with respect to the applicable Incremental Term Loan Facility promptly on demand by the Administrative Agent (or, after the occurrence of an actual or deemed entry of an order for relief with respect to the Borrower under the Bankruptcy Code of the United States, automatically and without further action by the Administrative Agent or any Term Lender or any Lender with respect to such Incremental Term Loan Facility), an amount equal to the excess of the amount of interest and fees that should have been paid for such period over the amount of interest and fees actually paid for such period.
ARTICLE III.

Taxes
.
(a)
Defined Term

Section 3.01
, the term “applicable Laws” includes FATCA
(b)
Payments Free of Taxes; Obligation to Withhold; Payments on Account of Taxes
.    Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of any Loan Party under any Loan Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable Laws. If any applicable Laws (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) require the deduction or withholding of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then the applicable Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding and shall timely pay the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with such Laws, and to the extent that the withholding or deduction is made on account of Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the applicable Loan Party shall be increased as necessary so that after any required withholding or the making of all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this
Section 3.01
) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholding or deduction been made.
(c)
Payment of Other Taxes by the Borrower

subsection (b)
above, the Borrower shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes.
(d)

.
(i)
The Borrower shall and does hereby indemnify each Recipient, and shall make payment in respect thereof within 10 days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this
Section 3.01
) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental
56
Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Borrower by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall, and does hereby, indemnify the Administrative Agent, and shall make payment in respect thereof within 10 days after demand therefor, for any amount which a Lender for any reason fails to pay indefeasibly to the Administrative Agent as required pursuant to
Section 3.01(d)(ii)
below. For the avoidance of doubt, (A) to the extent the Administrative Agent indefeasibly receives payment in full from the Borrower pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence for an amount that a Lender was required to indemnify the Administrative Agent for pursuant to clause (y) or (z) of
Section 3.01(d)(ii)
, and subsequent thereto the Administrative Agent receives payment from such Lender (including by way of set off pursuant to the last sentence of
Section 3.01(d)(ii)
) for that same indemnity that was previously paid in full by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent will promptly turn over to the Borrower the amount so received (including by way of set off pursuant to the last sentence of
Section 3.01(d)(ii)
) from such Lender (but in any event not in excess of the amount previously paid by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent in respect of such indemnity) and (B) to the extent the Administrative Agent receives a payment from the Borrower pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence for an amount that a Lender was required to indemnify the Administrative Agent for pursuant to clause (y) or (z) of
Section 3.01(d)(ii)
, such Lender shall be liable to the Borrower for reimbursement of such payment.
(ii)
Each Lender shall, and does hereby, severally indemnify, and shall make payment in respect thereof within 10 days after demand therefor, (x)  the Administrative Agent against any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the Borrower has not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), (y) the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, as applicable, against any Taxes attributable to such Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of
Section 10.06(d)
relating to the maintenance of a Participant Register and (z) the Administrative Agent and the Borrower, as applicable, against any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender, in each case, that are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent or the Borrower in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this
clause (ii)
.
57
(e)
Evidence of Payments

(f)
Status of Lenders; Tax Documentation
.
(i)
Any Lender that is entitled to an exemption from or reduction of withholding Tax with respect to payments made under any Loan Document shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, at the time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, such properly completed and executed documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. In addition, any Lender, if reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in
Section 3.01(f)(ii)(A)
,
(ii)(B)
and
(ii)(D)
below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.
(ii)
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
(A)
any Lender that is a U.S. Person shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the date on which such Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), executed copies of IRS Form W-9 certifying that such Lender is exempt from U.S. federal backup withholding tax;
(B)
any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), whichever of the following is applicable:
58
(I)
in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of an income tax treaty to which the United States is a party (x) with respect to payments of interest under any Loan Document, duly completed executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or W-8BEN, as applicable) establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “interest” article of such tax treaty and (y) with respect to any other applicable payments under any Loan Document, duly completed executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or W-8BEN, as applicable) establishing an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. federal withholding Tax pursuant to the “business profits” or “other income” article of such tax treaty;
(II)
duly completed executed copies of IRS Form W-8ECI;
(III)
in the case of a Foreign Lender claiming the benefits of the exemption for portfolio interest under Section 881(c) of the Code, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of
Exhibit J-1
to the effect that such Foreign Lender is not a “bank” within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code, a “10 percent shareholder” of the Borrower within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(B) of the Code, or a “controlled foreign corporation” described in Section 881(c)(3)(C) of the Code (a “
U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate
”) and (y) duly completed executed copies of IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or W-8BEN, as applicable); or
(IV)
to the extent a Foreign Lender is not the beneficial owner, duly completed executed copies of IRS Form W-8IMY, accompanied by IRS Form W-8ECI, IRS Form W-8BEN-E (or W-8BEN, as applicable), a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of
Exhibit J-2
or
Exhibit J-3
, IRS Form W-9, and/or other certification documents from each beneficial owner, as applicable;
provided
that if the Foreign Lender is a partnership and one or more direct or indirect partners of such Foreign Lender are claiming the portfolio interest exemption, such Foreign Lender may provide a U.S. Tax Compliance Certificate substantially in the form of
Exhibit J-4
on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;
(C)
any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (in such number of copies as shall be requested by the recipient) on or prior to the date on which such Foreign Lender becomes a Lender under this Agreement (and from time to time thereafter upon the reasonable request of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent), duly completed executed copies of any other form prescribed by applicable law as a basis for claiming exemption from or a reduction in U.S. federal withholding Tax, duly completed, together with such supplementary documentation as may be prescribed by applicable law to permit the Borrower or the Administrative Agent to determine the withholding or deduction required to be made; and
59
(D)
if a payment made to a Lender under any Loan Document would be subject to U.S. federal withholding Tax imposed by FATCA if such Lender were to fail to comply with the applicable reporting requirements of FATCA (including those contained in Section 1471(b) or 1472(b) of the Code, as applicable), such Lender shall deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent at the time or times prescribed by law and at such time or times reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent such documentation prescribed by applicable law (including as prescribed by Section 1471(b)(3)(C)(i) of the Code) and such additional documentation reasonably requested by the Borrower or the Administrative Agent as may be necessary for the Borrower and the Administrative Agent to comply with their obligations under FATCA and to determine that such Lender has complied with such Lender’s obligations under FATCA or to determine the amount to deduct and withhold from such payment. Solely for purposes of this clause (D), “FATCA” shall include any amendments made to FATCA after the date of this Agreement.
(iii)
Each Lender agrees that if any form or certification it previously delivered pursuant to this
Section 3.01
expires or becomes obsolete or inaccurate in any respect, it shall update such form or certification or promptly notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent in writing of its legal inability to do so.
(g)
Treatment of Certain Refunds
. Unless required by applicable Laws, at no time shall the Administrative Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender, or have any obligation to pay to any Lender, any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account of such Lender. If any Recipient determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Borrower or with respect to which the Borrower has paid additional amounts pursuant to this
Section 3.01
, it shall pay to the Borrower
an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Borrower
under this
Section 3.01
with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses (including Taxes) incurred by such Recipient, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such refund),
provided
that the Borrower, upon the request of the Recipient, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Recipient in the event the Recipient is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection, in no event will the applicable Recipient be required to pay any amount to the Borrower pursuant to this subsection the payment of which would place the Recipient in a less favorable net after-Tax position than such Recipient would have been in if the Tax subject to indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This subsection shall not be construed to require any Recipient to make
60
available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Borrower or any other Person.
(h)
Survival
. Each party’s obligations under this
Section 3.01
shall survive the resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent or any assignment of rights by, or the replacement of, a Lender, the termination of the Commitments and the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all other Obligations.
3.02
Illegality
. If any Lender determines that any Law has made it unlawful, or that any Governmental Authority has asserted that it is unlawful, for any Lender or its applicable Lending Office to perform any of its obligations hereunder or make, maintain or fund or charge interest with respect to any Credit Extension or to determine or charge interest rates based upon SOFR, Term SOFR or Daily Simple SOFR, or any Governmental Authority has imposed material restrictions on the authority of such Lender to purchase or sell Loans, then, on notice thereof by such Lender to the Borrower (through the Administrative Agent), (i) any obligation of such Lender to issue, make, maintain, fund or charge interest with respect to any Credit Extension or continue Term SOFR Loans or to convert Base Rate Loans or Daily SOFR Loans to Term SOFR Loans or to convert Term SOFR Loans or Base Rate Loans to Daily SOFR Loans shall be suspended, and (ii) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender making or maintaining Base Rate Loans the interest rate on which is determined by reference to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate, the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate, in each case until such Lender notifies the Administrative Agent and the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such determination no longer exist. Upon receipt of such notice, (x) the Borrower shall, upon demand from such Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), prepay or, if applicable, convert all Term SOFR Loans and/or Daily SOFR Loans of such Lender to Base Rate Loans (the interest rate on which Base Rate Loans of such Lender shall, if necessary to avoid such illegality, be determined by the Administrative Agent without reference to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate), immediately in the case of Daily SOFR Loans and, in the case of Term SOFR Loans, either on the last day of the Interest Period therefor, if such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Term SOFR Loans to such day, or immediately, if such Lender may not lawfully continue to maintain such Term SOFR Loans and (y) if such notice asserts the illegality of such Lender determining or charging interest rates based upon SOFR, the Administrative Agent shall during the period of such suspension compute the Base Rate applicable to such Lender without reference to the Term SOFR component thereof until the Administrative Agent is advised in writing by such Lender that it is no longer illegal for such Lender to determine or charge interest rates based upon SOFR. Upon any such prepayment or conversion, the Borrower shall also pay accrued interest on the amount so prepaid or converted, together with any additional amounts required pursuant to
Section 3.05
.
3.03
Inability to Determine Rates; Replacement of Term SOFR and SOFR or a Successor Rate
.
61
(a)
Inability to Determine Rates
. If in connection with any request for a Daily SOFR Loan or a Term SOFR Loan or a conversion of a Base Rate Loan or a Daily SOFR Loan to a Term SOFR Loan, any conversion of a Base Rate Loan or a Term SOFR Loan to a Daily SOFR Loan, or any continuation of a Term SOFR Loan, (i) the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error) that (A) no Successor Rate has been determined in accordance
with Section 3.03(b)
, and the circumstances under clause (i) of
Section 3.03(b)
or the Scheduled Unavailability Date has occurred, or (B) adequate and reasonable means do not exist for determining Term SOFR for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Term SOFR Committed Loan or in connection with an existing or proposed Base Rate Loan or for determining Daily Simple SOFR for any determination date with respect to an existing or proposed Daily SOFR Loan, or (ii) the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders determine that for any reason Term SOFR for any requested Interest Period with respect to a proposed Term SOFR Loan or Daily Simple SOFR with respect to an existing or proposed Daily SOFR Loan, as the case may be, does not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of funding such Loan, the Administrative Agent will promptly so notify the Borrower and each Lender in writing.
(b)
Thereafter, (x) the obligation of the Lenders to make or maintain Term SOFR Loans and/or to make Daily SOFR Loans, as applicable, or to convert Base Rate Loans or Daily SOFR Loans to Term SOFR Loans or Base Rate Loans or Term SOFR Loans to Daily SOFR Loans, shall be suspended (to the extent of the affected Term SOFR Loans, Daily SOFR Loans or Interest Periods), and (y) in the event of a determination described in clause (i)(B) of the preceding sentence with respect to the Term SOFR component of the Base Rate, the utilization of the Term SOFR component in determining the Base Rate shall be suspended, in each case until the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of a determination by the Required Lenders described in clause (ii) of this
Section 3.03(a)
, until the Administrative Agent upon instruction of the Required Lenders) revokes such notice.
(c)
Upon receipt of such written notice, (i) the Borrower may revoke any pending request for a Borrowing of, conversion to or continuation of Term SOFR Loans (to the extent of the affected Term SOFR Loans or Interest Periods) or any pending request for a Borrowing of or conversion to Daily SOFR Loans (to the extent of the affected Daily SOFR Loans or periods) or, failing that, will be deemed to have converted such request into a request for a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans in the amount specified therein and (ii) any outstanding Term SOFR Loans and Daily SOFR Loans shall be deemed to have been converted to Base Rate Loans immediately, in the case of Daily SOFR Loans, and at the end of their respective applicable Interest Period, in the case of Term SOFR Loans.
(d)
Replacement of Term SOFR and SOFR or a Successor Rate
. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement or any other Loan Document, if the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error), or the Borrower or Required Lenders notify the Administrative Agent (with, in the case of the Required Lenders, a copy to the Borrower) that the Borrower or Required Lenders (as applicable) have determined, that:
62
(i)
adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining both Daily Simple SOFR and one month, three month and six month interest periods of Term SOFR (for clarification, none of Daily Simple SOFR or Term SOFR for interest periods of one month, three months and six months are ascertainable), including, without limitation, because SOFR is not available or published on a current basis or the Term SOFR Screen Rate is not available or published on a current basis, as applicable, and such circumstances are unlikely to be temporary; or
(ii)
CME or any successor administrator of the Term SOFR Screen Rate, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or any successor administrator of SOFR, or a Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over the Administrative Agent or any such administrator with respect to its publication of SOFR and/or Term SOFR, as applicable, in each case acting in such capacity, has made a public statement identifying a specific date after which SOFR, one month, three month and six month interest periods for Term SOFR and the Term SOFR Screen Rate, as applicable, shall or will no longer be representative or made available, or permitted to be used for determining the interest rate of Dollar denominated syndicated loans, or shall or will otherwise cease; provided that, at the time of such statement, there are no successor administrators that are satisfactory to the Administrative Agent, that will continue to provide SOFR or such interest periods of Term SOFR, as applicable, after such specific date (the latest date on which each of Daily Simple SOFR, one month, three month and six month interest periods for Term SOFR and the Term SOFR Screen Rate are no longer representative or available permanently or indefinitely, the “
Scheduled Unavailability Date
”),
(c)
if the events or circumstances of the type described in
Section 3.03(b)(i)
or
(ii)
have occurred with respect to the Successor Rate then in effect, then, on a date and time determined by the Administrative Agent, which date shall be at the end of any Interest Period or on the relevant interest payment date, as applicable, for interest calculated and, solely with respect to clause (ii) above, no later than the Scheduled Unavailability Date, the Administrative Agent and the Borrower may amend this Agreement solely for the purpose of replacing SOFR and Term SOFR or any then current Successor Rate in accordance with this
Section 3.03
, with an alternative benchmark rate for loans denominated in Dollars giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar Dollar denominated credit facilities syndicated and agented in the United States for such alternative benchmark, and, in each case, including any mathematical or other adjustments to such benchmark giving due consideration to any evolving or then existing convention for similar Dollar denominated credit facilities syndicated and agented in the United States for such benchmark, which adjustment or method for calculating such adjustment shall be published on an information service as selected by the Administrative Agent from time to time in its reasonable discretion and may be periodically updated (and any such proposed rate, including for the avoidance of doubt, any adjustment thereto, a “
Successor Rate
”), and any such amendment shall become effective at 5:00 p.m. on the fifth Business Day after the Administrative Agent shall have posted such proposed amendment to all Lenders and
63
the Borrower unless, prior to such time, Lenders comprising the Required Lenders have delivered to the Administrative Agent written notice that such Required Lenders object to such amendment.

(a)
Increased Costs Generally
. If any Change in Law shall:
(i)
impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit, compulsory loan, insurance charge or similar requirement against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended or participated in by, any Lender;
(ii)
subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes, (B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or capital attributable thereto; or
(iii)
impose on any Lender any other condition, cost or expense (other than Taxes) affecting this Agreement or Loans made by such Lender;
64
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender of making, converting to, continuing or maintaining any Loan (or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan), or to reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount) then, upon request of such Lender, the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender for such additional costs incurred or reduction suffered.
(b)
Capital Requirements
. If any Lender determines that any Change in Law affecting such Lender or any Lending Office of such Lender, or such Lender’s holding company, if any, regarding capital or liquidity requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s holding company, if any, as a consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by such Lender, to a level below that which such Lender or such Lender’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s policies and the policies of such Lender’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy and liquidity requirements), then from time to time the Borrower will pay to such Lender such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such Lender’s holding company for any such reduction suffered.
(c)
Certificates for Reimbursement

subsection (a)
or
(b)
of this Section and delivered to the Borrower shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Borrower shall pay such Lender the amount shown as due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.
(d)
Delay in Requests
. Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand compensation pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this
Section 3.04
shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s right to demand such compensation,
provided
that the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered more than nine months prior to the date that such Lender notifies the Borrower of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions and of such Lender’s intention to claim compensation therefor (except that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the nine-month period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of retroactive effect thereof).
(e)
Consistent Treatment
. Each Lender agrees that amounts claimed under this
Section 3.04
shall be reasonably determined by such Lender (which determination shall be made in good faith (and not on an arbitrary or capricious basis) and consistent with similarly situated customers of the applicable Lender under agreements having provisions similar to this
Section 3.04
after consideration of such factors as such Lender then reasonably determines to be relevant).
3.05
Compensation for Losses
. Upon written demand of any Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) from time to time setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for, and manner of calculating such compensation, the Borrower shall within thirty (30) days following
65
receipt of such demand compensate such Lender for and hold such Lender harmless from any loss, cost or expense incurred by it as a result of:

any continuation, conversion, payment or prepayment of any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan or a Daily SOFR Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period for such Loan (whether voluntary, mandatory, automatic, by reason of acceleration, or otherwise);
(b)
any failure by the Borrower (for a reason other than the failure of such Lender to make a Loan) to prepay, borrow, continue or convert any Loan other than a Base Rate Loan on the date or in the amount notified by the Borrower; or
(c)
any assignment of a Term SOFR Loan on a day other than the last day of the Interest Period therefor as a result of a request by the Borrower pursuant to
Section 10.13
;
including any loss or expense arising from the liquidation or reemployment of funds (but excluding any loss of anticipated profits) obtained by it to maintain such Loan or from fees payable to terminate the deposits from which such funds were obtained. The Borrower shall also pay any customary administrative fees charged by such Lender in connection with the foregoing.
3.06
Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders
.
(a)
Designation of a Different Lending Office
. Each Lender may make any Credit Extension to the Borrower through any Lending Office, provided that the exercise of this option shall not affect or increase the obligation of the Borrower to repay the Credit Extension in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. If any Lender requests compensation under
Section 3.04
, or requires the Borrower to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to
Section 3.01
, or if any Lender gives a notice pursuant to
Section 3.02
, then at the request of the Borrower such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a different Lending Office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to
Section 3.01
or
3.04
, as the case may be, in the future, or eliminate the need for the notice pursuant to
Section 3.02
, as applicable, and (ii) in each case, would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Borrower hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
(b)
Replacement of Lenders
. If any Lender requests compensation under
Section 3.04
, or if the Borrower is required to pay any Indemnified Taxes or additional amounts to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to
Section 3.01
and, in each case, such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different lending office in accordance with
Section 3.06(a)
, the Borrower may replace such Lender in accordance with
Section 10.13
.
66

Survival

ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT
9.01
Appointment and Authority
. Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints Wells Fargo Bank to act on its behalf as the Administrative Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such action as contractual representative on such Lender’s behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Not in limitation of the foregoing, each Lender authorizes and directs the Administrative Agent to enter into the Loan Documents for the benefit of the Lenders. Each Lender hereby agrees that, except as otherwise set forth herein, any action taken by the Required Lenders in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or the Loan Documents, and the exercise by the Required Lenders of the powers set forth herein or therein, together with such other powers as are reasonably incidental thereto, shall be authorized and binding upon all of the Lenders. The provisions of this Article are solely for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, and neither the Borrower nor any other Loan Party shall have rights as a third party beneficiary of any of such provisions. Nothing herein shall be construed to deem the Administrative Agent a trustee or fiduciary for any Lender or to impose on the Administrative Agent duties or obligations other than those expressly provided for herein. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the use of the terms “Agent”, “Administrative Agent”, “agent” and similar terms in the Loan Documents with reference to the Administrative Agent is not intended to connote any fiduciary or other implied (or express) obligations arising under agency doctrine of any applicable Law. Instead, use of such terms is merely a matter of market custom, and is intended to create or reflect only an administrative relationship between independent contracting parties. As to any matters not
96
expressly provided for by the Loan Documents (including, without limitation, enforcement or collection of any of the Obligations), the Administrative Agent shall not be required to exercise any discretion or take any action, but shall be required to act or to refrain from acting (and shall be fully protected in so acting or refraining from acting) upon the instructions of the Required Lenders (or all of the Lenders if explicitly required under any other provision of this Agreement), and such instructions shall be binding upon all Lenders and all holders of any of the Obligations;
provided
,
however
, that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Administrative Agent shall not be required to take any action which exposes the Administrative Agent to personal liability or which is contrary to this Agreement or any other Loan Document or applicable Law, including for the avoidance of doubt any action that may be in violation of the automatic stay under any Debtor Relief Law or that may effect a forfeiture, modification or termination of property of a Defaulting Lender in violation of any Debtor Relief Law. Not in limitation of the foregoing, the Administrative Agent may exercise any right or remedy it or the Lenders may have under any Loan Document upon the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default unless the Required Lenders have directed the Administrative Agent otherwise. Without limiting the foregoing, no Lender shall have any right of action whatsoever against the Administrative Agent as a result of the Administrative Agent acting or refraining from acting under this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents in accordance with the instructions of the Required Lenders, or where applicable, all the Lenders.
9.02
Rights as a Lender
.

clause (d)
of the definition thereof, the Required Lenders may, to the extent permitted by applicable law, by notice in writing to the Borrower and such Person remove such Person as Administrative Agent and, with the consent of the Borrower at all times other than during the existence of an Event of Default (which consent of the Borrower shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and shall be deemed given if the Borrower fails to respond within ten (10) Business Days), appoint a successor.

Upon the acceptance of a successor’s appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all of the rights, powers, privileges and duties of the retiring (or removed) Administrative Agent (other than as provided in
Section 3.01(f)
and other than any rights to indemnity payments or other amounts owed to the retiring or removed Administrative Agent as of the Resignation Effective Date or the Removal Effective Date, as applicable), and the retiring or removed Administrative Agent shall be discharged from all of its duties and obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents (if not already discharged therefrom as provided above in this Section).

Section 2.14

solely for this purpose as a non-fiduciary agent of the Borrower, maintain a register on which it enters the name and address of each Participant and the principal amounts (and stated interest) of each Participant’s interest in the Loans or other obligations under the Loan Documents (the “
Participant Register

The rights of each Lender and their respective Affiliates under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) that such Lender or its Affiliates may have. Each Lender agrees to notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent promptly after any such setoff and application,

Maximum Rate
”). If the Administrative Agent or any Lender shall receive interest in an amount that exceeds the Maximum Rate, the excess interest shall be applied to the principal of the Loans or, if it exceeds such unpaid principal, refunded to the Borrower. In determining whether the interest contracted for, charged, or received by the Administrative Agent or a Lender exceeds the Maximum Rate, such Person may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (a) characterize any payment that is not principal as an expense, fee, or premium rather than interest, (b) exclude voluntary prepayments and the effects thereof, and (c) amortize, prorate, allocate, and spread in equal or unequal parts the total amount of interest throughout the contemplated term of the Obligations hereunder.

Except as provided in
Section 4.01
, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof that, when taken together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.
10.11
Survival of Representations and Warranties
.
All representations and warranties made hereunder and in any other Loan Document or other document delivered pursuant hereto or thereto or in connection herewith or therewith shall survive the execution and delivery hereof and thereof.

10.12
Severability
. If any provision of this Agreement or the other Loan Documents is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, (a) the legality, validity and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents shall not be affected or
119
impaired thereby and (b) the parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the illegal, invalid or unenforceable provisions. The invalidity of a provision in a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this
Section 10.12
, if and to the extent that the enforceability of any provisions in this Agreement relating to Defaulting Lenders shall be limited by Debtor Relief Laws, as determined in good faith by the Administrative Agent, then such provisions shall be deemed to be in effect only to the extent not so limited.
10.13
Replacement of Lenders
. If the Borrower is entitled to replace a Lender pursuant to the provisions of
Section 3.06
, or
if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender or a Non-Consenting Lender, then the Borrower may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by,
Section 10.06
), all of its interests, rights (other than its existing rights to payments pursuant to
Sections 3.01
and
3.04
) and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an Eligible Assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment), provided that:
(a)
the Borrower shall have paid to the Administrative Agent the assignment fee (if any) specified in
Section 10.06(b)
;
(b)
such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under
Section 3.05
) from the assignee (to the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Borrower (in the case of all other amounts);
(c)
in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under
Section 3.04
or payments required to be made pursuant to
Section 3.01
, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter or the Borrower (or in the reasonable, good faith opinion of the Borrower will in the future result in a reduction in compensation or payments that they are required to pay pursuant to
Section 3.01
);
(d)
such assignment does not conflict with applicable Laws; and
(e)
in the case of an assignment resulting from a Lender becoming a Non-Consenting Lender, the applicable assignee shall have consented to the applicable amendment, waiver or consent.
A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Borrower to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
120
Each party hereto agrees that (a) an assignment required pursuant to this
Section 10.13
may be effected pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption executed by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent and the assignee and (b) the Lender required to make such assignment need not be a party thereto in order for such assignment to be effective and shall be deemed to have consented to an be bound by the terms thereof;
provided
that, following the effectiveness of any such assignment, the other parties to such assignment agree to execute and deliver such documents necessary to evidence such assignment as reasonably requested by the applicable Lender,
provided
,
further
that any such documents shall be without recourse to or warranty by the parties thereto.
Notwithstanding anything in this
Section 10.13
to the contrary, the Lender that acts as the Administrative Agent may not be replaced hereunder except in accordance with the terms of
Section 9.06
.

Supported QFC

In the event a Covered Party or a BHC Act Affiliate of a Covered Party becomes subject to a proceeding under a U.S. Special Resolution Regime, Default Rights under the Loan Documents that might otherwise apply to such Supported QFC or any QFC Credit Support that may be exercised against such Covered Party are permitted to be exercised to no greater extent than such Default Rights could be exercised under the U.S. Special Resolution Regime if the Supported QFC and the Loan Documents were governed by the laws of the United States or a state of the United States.

”) will be terminated, all outstanding obligations owing to each Exiting Lender will be repaid in full and each Exiting Lender will cease to be a Lender under the Existing Credit Agreement and will not be a Lender under this Agreement. As of the Restatement Effective Date, the remaining “Lenders” under (and as defined in) the Existing Credit Agreement shall be Lenders under this Agreement with Commitments as set forth on
Schedule 2.01
and by its execution and delivery of this Agreement, each such remaining Lender hereby consents to the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and the non-pro rata repayment in full of all loans and other obligations owing (whether or not due) to the Exiting Lenders. On the Restatement Effective Date, effective immediately following such repayment, the Existing Credit Agreement shall be amended, restated and superseded in its entirety by this Agreement. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, whether executed and delivered in connection herewith or otherwise, are not intended to be or operate as a novation or an accord and satisfaction of the Existing Credit Agreement or the obligations evidenced thereby or provided for thereunder (except with respect to the Exiting Lenders, except that the provisions of the Existing Credit Agreement that by their express terms survive the termination of the Existing Credit Agreement shall continue for the Exiting Lenders). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, after giving effect to the Exiting Lender commitment terminations and repayments, (i) all “Loans” under (and as defined in) the Existing Credit Agreement shall on the Restatement Effective Date become Loans hereunder and (ii) all other Obligations outstanding under the Existing Credit Agreement shall on the Restatement Effective Date be
130
Obligations under this Agreement, in each case, pursuant to a cashless settlement mechanism approved by the Borrower, the Administrative Agent, and the Lenders.
(k)
On the Restatement Effective Date, the Original Term Note, if any, held by each Lender shall be deemed to be cancelled and, if such Lender has requested a Term Note hereunder, amended and restated by the Term Note delivered hereunder on or about the Restatement Effective Date (regardless of whether any Lender shall have delivered to the Borrower any Original Term Note held by it for cancellation). Each Lender, whether or not requesting a Note hereunder, shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to deliver each Original Term Note held by it to the Borrower for cancellation and/or amendment and restatement. All amounts owing under, and evidenced by, the Original Term Note held by a Lender as of the Restatement Effective Date shall continue to be outstanding hereunder, and shall from and after the Restatement Effective Date, if requested by such Lender, be evidenced by the Term Note received by such Lender pursuant to this Agreement, and shall in any event be evidenced by, and governed by the terms of, this Agreement. Each Lender hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Borrower from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, actions or claims that may be imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Borrower arising out of such Lender’s failure to deliver the Original Term Note held by it to the Borrower for cancellation, subject to the condition that the Borrower shall not make any payment to any Person claiming to be the holder of any such Original Term Note unless such Lender is first notified of such claim and is given the opportunity, at such Lender’s sole cost and expense, to assert any defenses to such payment.
(l)
(i) The execution, delivery and effectiveness of this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver of any right, power or remedy of the Administrative Agent or the Lenders under the Existing Credit Agreement or the other Loan Documents (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement), nor constitute a waiver of any covenant, agreement or obligation under the Existing Credit Agreement or the other Loan Documents (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement), except to the extent that any such covenant, agreement or obligation is no longer set forth herein or is modified hereby or by any of the other Loan Documents executed and delivered on the Restatement Effective Date, (ii) any and all references in the Loan Documents to the Existing Credit Agreement shall, without further action of the parties, be deemed a reference to the Existing Credit Agreement, as amended and restated by this Agreement, and as this Agreement shall be further amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified from time to time and (iii) unless any Loan Document has been expressly amended and restated pursuant to this Agreement, any Loan Document as defined in, or executed pursuant to, the Existing Credit Agreement shall constitute a Loan Document hereunder.

SECTION III—ADDITIONAL TERMS AND CONDITIONS
Disbursement Requests.
Lender must receive disbursement requests in writing. Verbal requests are not accepted. Disbursement requests will only be accepted from the applicable Authorized Persons set forth in this Agreement. Disbursement requests will be processed subject to satisfactory completion of Lender’s customer verification procedures. Lender is only responsible for making a good faith effort to execute each disbursement request
Rev 09/25
and may use agents of its choice to execute disbursement requests. Funds disbursed pursuant to a disbursement request may be transmitted directly to an indicated bank, or indirectly to the indicated bank through another bank, government agency, or other third party that Lender considers to be reasonable. Lender will, in its sole discretion, determine the funds transfer system and the means by which each disbursement will be made. Lender may delay or refuse to accept a disbursement request if the disbursement would: (i) violate the terms of this Agreement; (ii) require use of a bank unacceptable to Lender or prohibited by government authority; (iii) cause Lender to violate any Federal Reserve or other regulatory risk control program or guideline; or (iv) otherwise cause Lender to violate any applicable law or regulation. Lender shall have the right to modify disbursement requests based on the underlying governing Loan documentation. A new Disbursement Instruction Agreement must be completed and signed by the Borrower if (i) any or all of a disbursement is to be transferred to an account not described herein or (ii) Borrower wishes to add or delete any Authorized Persons.
Limitation of Liability.
Lender shall not be liable to Borrower or any other parties for: (i) errors, acts or failures to act of others, including other entities, banks, communications carriers or clearinghouses, through which Borrower’s requested disbursements may be made or through which information may be received or transmitted, and no such entity shall be deemed an agent of Lender; (ii) any loss, liability or delay caused by fires, earthquakes, wars, civil disturbances, power surges or failures, acts of government, labor disputes, failures in communications networks, legal constraints or other events beyond Lender’s control; or (iii) any special, consequential, indirect or punitive damages, whether or not (A) any claim for these damages is based on tort or contract or (B) Lender or Borrower knew or should have known the likelihood of these damages in any situation. Lender makes no representations or warranties other than those expressly made in this Agreement. IN NO EVENT WILL LENDER BE LIABLE FOR DAMAGES ARISING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY IF A DISBURSEMENT REQUEST IS EXECUTED BY LENDER IN GOOD FAITH AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT.
Reliance on Information Provided.
Lender is authorized to rely on the information provided by Borrower or any Authorized Person in or in accordance with this Agreement when executing a disbursement request until Lender has received a new Disbursement Instruction Agreement signed by Borrower. Borrower agrees to be bound by any disbursement request: (i) authorized or transmitted by Borrower; or (ii) made in Borrower’s name and accepted by Lender in good faith and in compliance with this Agreement, even if not properly authorized by Borrower. Lender may rely solely (i) on the account number provided, rather than the receiving party’s name, and (ii) on the bank routing number provided, rather than the receiving bank’s name, in executing a disbursement request. Lender is not obligated or required in any way to take any actions to detect errors in information provided by Borrower or an Authorized Person.

Form of Guaranty Agreement
AMENDED AND RESTATED CONTINUING GUARANTY
AMENDED AND RESTATED CONTINUING GUARANTY (as amended, modified, restated and/or supplemented from time to time, this “
Guaranty
”), dated as of November 14, 2025 made by and among each of the undersigned guarantors (together with any other entity that becomes a party hereto pursuant to
Section 19
hereof, each a “
Guarantor
” and collectively, the “
Guarantors
”) in favor of WELLS FARGO BANK, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, as Administrative Agent (in such capacity, together with any successor administrative agent, the “
Administrative Agent
”), for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders (collectively, the “
Guaranteed Parties
”). Except as otherwise defined herein, all capitalized terms used herein and defined in the Credit Agreement (as defined below) shall be used herein as therein defined.
W I T N E S S E T H
:
WHEREAS Empire State Realty Trust, Inc., a Maryland corporation (the “
Parent
”), Empire State Realty OP, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (the “
Borrower
”), the lenders from time to time party thereto (the “
Lenders
”) and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent, have entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated as of the date hereof (as amended, modified, restated and/or supplemented from time to time, the “
Credit Agreement
”), providing for the making of Loans and other Credit Extensions to the Borrower all as contemplated therein;
WHEREAS, each Guarantor is a direct or indirect Wholly-Owned Subsidiary of the Borrower as of the date hereof;
WHEREAS, it is a condition precedent to the effectiveness of the Credit Agreement, and the making of Loans and other Credit Extensions thereunder, that each Guarantor shall have executed and delivered to the Administrative Agent this Guaranty; and
WHEREAS, each Guarantor will obtain substantial direct and indirect benefits from the incurrence of Loans and other Credit Extensions by the Borrower under the Credit Agreement and, accordingly, desires to execute this Guaranty in order to satisfy the condition described in the preceding paragraph and to induce the Lenders to make Loans and other Credit Extensions to the Borrower;
NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and other benefits accruing to each Guarantor, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, each Guarantor hereby makes the following representations and warranties to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Guaranteed Parties and hereby covenants and agrees with each other Guarantor and the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders as follows:
1.
Guaranty
.
Each Guarantor, jointly and severally with the other Guarantors, hereby absolutely, irrevocably and unconditionally guarantees, as a guaranty of payment and
performance and not as a guaranty of collection, prompt payment when due, whether at stated maturity, by required prepayment, upon acceleration, demand or otherwise, and at all times thereafter, of all of the Obligations (for each Guarantor, subject to the proviso in this sentence, its “
Guaranteed Obligations
”);
provided
, that the liability of each Guarantor individually with respect to this Guaranty shall be limited to an aggregate amount equal to the largest amount that would not render its obligations hereunder subject to avoidance under Section 548 of the Bankruptcy Code of the United States or any comparable provisions of any applicable state law. The books and records of the Administrative Agent showing the amount of the Obligations shall be admissible in evidence in any action or proceeding, and shall be binding upon the Guarantors and conclusive for the purpose of establishing the amount of the Guaranteed Obligations, absent manifest error. This Guaranty shall not be affected by the genuineness, validity, regularity or enforceability of the Guaranteed Obligations or any instrument or agreement evidencing any Guaranteed Obligations, or by the existence, validity, enforceability, perfection, non-perfection or extent of any collateral therefor, or by any fact or circumstance relating to the Guaranteed Obligations which might otherwise constitute a defense to the obligations of any Guarantor under this Guaranty, and each Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives any defenses it may now have or hereafter acquire in any way relating to any or all of the foregoing.
2.
No Setoff or Deductions; Taxes; Payments
All payments by any Guarantor hereunder shall be made in accordance with, and subject to the provisions of, Section 3.01 of the Credit Agreement.
3.
Rights of Guaranteed Parties
Each Guarantor consents and agrees that the Guaranteed Parties may, at any time and from time to time, without notice or demand to or consent of such Guarantor, and without affecting the enforceability or continuing effectiveness hereof: (a) amend, extend, renew, compromise, discharge, accelerate or otherwise change the times for payment or the terms of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof; (b) take, hold, exchange, enforce, waive, release, fail to perfect, sell, impair, or otherwise dispose of any security, or any Lien granted, for the payment of this Guaranty or any Guaranteed Obligations; (c) apply such security and direct the order or manner of sale thereof as provided in the Loan Documents; and (d) release or substitute any other Guarantor or one or more of any endorsers or other guarantors of any of the Guaranteed Obligations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Guarantor consents to the taking of, or failure to take, any action which might in any manner or to any extent vary the risks of the Guarantors under this Guaranty or which, but for this provision, might operate as a discharge of one or more of the Guarantors.
4.
Certain Waivers
Each Guarantor waives (a) any defense arising by reason of any disability or other defense of the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof, or the cessation from any cause whatsoever (including any act or omission of any Guaranteed Party) of the liability of the Borrower (other than the defense of prior payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations); (b) any defense based on any claim that
2
such Guarantor’s obligations exceed or are more burdensome than those of the Borrower; (c) the benefit of any statute of limitations affecting such Guarantor’s liability hereunder; (d) any right to require any Guaranteed Party to proceed against the Borrower or any other Loan Party, proceed against or exhaust any security for any of the Guaranteed Obligations, or pursue any other remedy in the power of any Guaranteed Party; (e) any benefit of and any right to participate in any security now or hereafter held by any Guaranteed Party; and (f) to the full extent permitted by law, any and all other defenses (other than the defense of prior payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations) or benefits that may be derived from or afforded by limiting the liability of or exonerating guarantors or sureties. Each Guarantor expressly waives all setoffs and counterclaims and all presentments, demands for payment or performance, notices of nonpayment or nonperformance, protests, notices of protest, notices of dishonor and all other notices or demands of any kind or nature whatsoever with respect to the Guaranteed Obligations, and all notices of acceptance of this Guaranty or of the existence, creation or incurrence of new or additional Guaranteed Obligations.
5.
Obligations Independent
The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are those of primary obligor, and not merely as surety, and are independent of the Guaranteed Obligations and the obligations of any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations or any part thereof, and a separate action may be brought against any Guarantor to enforce this Guaranty whether or not the Borrower or any other Person is joined as a party. For the avoidance of doubt, all obligations of each Guarantor under this Guaranty are joint and several obligations of all the Guarantors, subject to the limitations set forth in
Section 1
hereof.
6.
Subrogation
No Guarantor shall exercise any right of subrogation, contribution, indemnity, reimbursement or similar rights with respect to any payments it makes under this Guaranty until after the Facility Termination Date. If any amounts are paid to any Guarantor in violation of the foregoing limitation, then such amounts shall be held in trust by such Guarantor for the benefit of the Guaranteed Parties and shall forthwith be paid to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Guaranteed Parties for application to the Guaranteed Obligations in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents or, if the Loan Documents do not provide for the application of such amount, to be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral security for any Guaranteed Obligations thereafter existing, whether matured or unmatured.
7.
Termination; Reinstatement.
Subject to the terms of
Section 8
below, this Guaranty is a continuing, absolute, unconditional and irrevocable guaranty of all Guaranteed Obligations now or hereafter existing and shall remain in full force and effect until the Facility Termination Date, and upon the occurrence of the Facility Termination Date this Guaranty shall terminate and be of no further effect (
provided
that all indemnities set forth herein and the other Loan Documents shall survive any such termination).
3
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Guaranty shall continue in full force and effect or be revived, as the case may be, if any payment by or on behalf of the Borrower or any Guarantor is made, or a Guaranteed Party exercises its right of setoff, in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations and such payment or the proceeds of such setoff or any part thereof is subsequently invalidated, declared to be fraudulent or preferential, set aside or required (including pursuant to any settlement entered into by a Guaranteed Party in its discretion) to be repaid to a trustee, receiver or any other party, in connection with any proceeding under any Debtor Relief Laws or otherwise, all as if such payment had not been made or such setoff had not occurred and whether or not the Guaranteed Parties are in possession of or have released this Guaranty and regardless of any prior revocation, rescission, termination or reduction. The obligations of the Guarantors under this paragraph shall survive termination of this Guaranty.
8.
Release of Liability of Guarantor Upon Sale or Dissolution and Certain Other Events.
(a)
In the event that the Administrative Agent is required to release any Guarantor from its guaranty and other obligations hereunder pursuant to Section 10.19 of the Credit Agreement, the Administrative Agent will release such Guarantor in accordance with Section 10.19 of the Credit Agreement.
(b)
The Administrative Agent shall have no liability whatsoever to any Guaranteed Party as a result of any release of any Guarantor by it in accordance with (or which the Administrative Agent in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct believes to be in accordance with) this
Section 8
or Section 10.19 of the Credit Agreement.
9.
Stay of Acceleration
In the event that acceleration of the time for payment of any of the Guaranteed Obligations is stayed, in connection with any case commenced by or against the Borrower or any other Loan Party under any Debtor Relief Laws, or otherwise, all such amounts shall nonetheless be payable by the Guarantors who are not subject to such automatic stay immediately upon demand by the Administrative Agent.
10.
Expenses
The Guarantors, jointly and severally, shall pay on demand all out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent or any other Guaranteed Party if, and to the same extent that, the Borrower is required to pay such out-of-pockets expenses under Section 10.04 of the Credit Agreement. The obligations of the Guarantors under this paragraph shall survive the payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations and termination of this Guaranty.
11.
Modifications; Miscellaneous
Neither this Guaranty nor any provision hereof may be changed, waived, discharged or terminated except in a writing signed by each Guarantor directly affected thereby (it being understood that the addition or release of any Guarantor hereunder shall not constitute a change,
4
waiver, discharge or termination affecting any Guarantor other than the Guarantor so added or released) and the Administrative Agent (with the consent of the Required Lenders or all of the Lenders, to the extent required by Section 10.01 of the Credit Agreement). No failure by any Guaranteed Party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, remedy or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy or power hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy. The remedies herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law or in equity. The unenforceability or invalidity of any provision of this Guaranty shall not affect the enforceability or validity of any other provision herein. This Guaranty is not intended to supersede or otherwise affect any other guaranty now or hereafter given by any Guarantor for the benefit of the Guaranteed Parties (or any of them) or any term or provision thereof.
12.
Condition of Loan Parties
Each Guarantor acknowledges and agrees that it has the sole responsibility for, and has adequate means of, obtaining from the Loan Parties and any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations such information concerning the financial condition, business and operations of the Loan Parties and any such other guarantors as such Guarantor requires, and that no Guaranteed Party has any duty, and no Guarantor is relying on any Guaranteed Party at any time, to disclose to such Guarantor any information relating to the business, operations or financial condition of any Loan Party or any other guarantor of the Guaranteed Obligations (such Guarantor waiving any duty on the part of the Guaranteed Parties to disclose such information and any defense relating to the failure to provide the same).
13.
Setoff
If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Guarantor hereby authorizes each Lender and each of their respective Affiliates to exercise against such Guarantor the rights of set-off set forth in Section 10.08 of the Credit Agreement.
14.
Representations and Warranties
Each Guarantor represents and warrants that (a) it is duly organized and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and has full capacity and right to make and perform this Guaranty, and all necessary authority has been obtained; (b) this Guaranty constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting the enforceability of creditors’ rights generally and by general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is sought at law or in equity); (c) the making and performance of this Guaranty does not and will not violate the provisions of any material applicable law, regulation, judgment or order, and does not and will not result in the breach of, or constitute a default or require any consent under, any material Contractual Obligation of such Guarantor; and (d) all consents, approvals, licenses and authorizations of, and filings and registrations with, any Governmental Authority required under applicable law and regulations for the making and performance of this Guaranty have been
5
obtained or made and are in full force and effect. In addition, each Guarantor represents and warrants that (x) until after the Facility Termination Date has occurred, such Guarantor will take, or will refrain from taking, as the case may be, all actions that are necessary to be taken or not taken so that no violation of any provision, covenant or agreement contained in the Credit Agreement, and so that no Event of Default, is caused by the actions of such Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries; and (y) an executed (or conformed) copy of each of the Loan Documents has been made available to a senior officer of such Guarantor and such officer is familiar with the contents thereof.
15.
Indemnification and Survival
Without limitation on any other obligations of any Guarantor or remedies of any Guaranteed Party under this Guaranty, each Guarantor shall, jointly and severally, to the full extent permitted by law, indemnify, defend and save and hold harmless each Indemnitee if, and to the same extent that, the Borrower is required indemnify, defend and save and hold harmless such Indemnitee under Section 10.04 of the Credit Agreement. The obligations of the Guarantors under this paragraph shall survive the payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations and termination of this Guaranty.
16.
Guaranty Enforceable by Administrative Agent
This Guaranty may be enforced only by the action of the Administrative Agent, in each case acting upon the instructions of the Required Lenders (to the extent required under the Credit Agreement) and no other Guaranteed Party will have any right individually to seek to enforce or to enforce this Guaranty, it being understood and agreed that such rights and remedies may be exercised by the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Guaranteed Parties, upon the terms of this Guaranty and the other Loan Documents. It is understood and agreed that the agreement in this
Section 16
is solely for the benefit of the Guaranteed Parties.
17.
Obligations of Guarantors Independent
The obligations of each Guarantor hereunder are independent of the obligations of any other Guarantor, any other guarantor or any Guaranteed Obligations, and a separate action or actions may be brought and prosecuted against each Guarantor whether or not action is brought against any other Guarantor, the Borrower or any other Person and whether or not any other Guarantor, the Borrower or any other Person may be joined in any such action or actions.
18.
Subordination of Indebtedness Held by Guarantors
Any indebtedness of any Loan Party now or hereafter held by any Guarantor is hereby subordinated to the prior payment in full in immediately available funds of all the Guaranteed Obligations, and such indebtedness of any Loan Party to any Guarantor, if the Administrative Agent, after an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, so requests, shall be collected, enforced and received by such Guarantor as trustee for the Guaranteed Parties, shall be segregated from all other property or funds of such Guarantor and shall be paid over to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Guaranteed Parties for application to the Guaranteed
6
Obligations in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents or, if the Loan Documents do not provide for the application of such amount, to be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral security for any Guaranteed Obligations thereafter existing, but without affecting or impairing in any manner the liability of such Guarantor under the other provisions of this Guaranty. In the event that any Guarantor receives any payment of any indebtedness described in the first sentence of this
Section 18
prior to the Facility Termination Date and during the existence of an Event of Default, such payment of such indebtedness which has been received by such Guarantor, if requested by the Administrative Agent, shall be received by such Guarantor as trustee for the Guaranteed Parties, shall be segregated from all other property or funds of such Guarantor and shall be paid over to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Guaranteed Parties for application to the Guaranteed Obligations in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents or, if the Loan Documents do not provide for the application of such amount, to be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral security for any Guaranteed Obligations thereafter existing. Prior to the transfer by any Guarantor of any note or negotiable instrument evidencing any indebtedness of any Loan Party to such Guarantor, such Guarantor shall mark such note or negotiable instrument with a legend that the same is subject to this subordination. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each Guarantor hereby agrees with the Guaranteed Parties that it will not exercise any right of subrogation which it may at any time otherwise have as a result of this Guaranty (whether contractual, under Section 509 of the Bankruptcy Code or otherwise) until after the Facility Termination Date has occurred;
provided
that if any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor on account of such subrogation rights prior to such time, such amount shall be held in trust for the benefit of the Guaranteed Parties and shall forthwith be paid to the Administrative Agent for the benefit of the Guaranteed Parties to be credited and applied to the Guaranteed Obligations, whether matured or unmatured, in accordance with the terms of the Loan Documents or, if the Loan Documents do not provide for the application of such amount, to be held by the Administrative Agent as collateral security for any Guaranteed Obligations thereafter existing. Upon the occurrence of the Facility Termination Date, each Guarantor shall be subrogated to the rights of the Guaranteed Parties to receive payments or distributions applicable to the Guaranteed Obligations until all Indebtedness of the Loan Parties held by such Guarantor shall be paid in full.

Any Person that is required to become a party to this Guaranty after the date hereof pursuant to the Credit Agreement shall become a Guarantor hereunder by executing and delivering a joinder agreement in the form attached hereto as

Contribution
At any time a payment in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations is made under this Guaranty, the right of contribution of each Guarantor against each other Guarantor shall be determined as provided in the immediately following sentence, with the right of contribution of each Guarantor to be revised and restated as of each date on which a payment (a “
Relevant Payment
”) is made on the Guaranteed Obligations under this Guaranty. At any time that a Relevant Payment is made by a Guarantor that results in the aggregate payments made by such
7
Guarantor in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations to and including the date of the Relevant Payment exceeding such Guarantor’s Contribution Percentage (as defined below) of the aggregate payments made by all Guarantors in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations to and including the date of the Relevant Payment (such excess, the “
Aggregate Excess Amount
”), each such Guarantor shall have a right of contribution against each other Guarantor who either has not made any payments or has made payments in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations to and including the date of the Relevant Payment in an aggregate amount less than such other Guarantor’s Contribution Percentage of the aggregate payments made to and including the date of the Relevant Payment by all Guarantors in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations (the aggregate amount of such deficit, the “
Aggregate Deficit Amount
”) in an amount equal to (x) a fraction the numerator of which is the Aggregate Excess Amount of such Guarantor and the denominator of which is the Aggregate Excess Amount of all Guarantors multiplied by (y) the Aggregate Deficit Amount of such other Guarantor. A Guarantor’s right of contribution pursuant to the preceding sentences shall arise at the time of each computation, subject to adjustment at the time of each computation;
provided
, that no Guarantor may take any action to enforce such right until after the Facility Termination Date has occurred, it being expressly recognized and agreed by all parties hereto that any Guarantor’s right of contribution arising pursuant to this
Section 20
against any other Guarantor shall be expressly junior and subordinate to such other Guarantor’s obligations and liabilities in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations and any other obligations owing under this Guaranty. As used in this
Section 20
, (i) each Guarantor’s “
Contribution Percentage
” shall mean the percentage obtained by dividing (x) the Adjusted Net Worth (as defined below) of such Guarantor by (y) the aggregate Adjusted Net Worth of all Guarantors; (ii) the “
Adjusted Net Worth
” of each Guarantor shall mean the greater of (x) the Net Worth (as defined below) of such Guarantor and (y) zero; and (iii) the “
Net Worth
” of each Guarantor shall mean the amount by which the fair saleable value of such Guarantor’s assets on the date of any Relevant Payment exceeds its existing debts and other liabilities (including contingent liabilities, but without giving effect to any Guaranteed Obligations arising under this Guaranty) on such date. All parties hereto recognize and agree that, except for any right of contribution arising pursuant to this
Section 20
, each Guarantor who makes any payment in respect of the Guaranteed Obligations shall have no right of contribution or subrogation against any other Guarantor in respect of such payment until after the Facility Termination Date has occurred. Each of the Guarantors recognizes and acknowledges that the rights to contribution arising hereunder shall constitute an asset in favor of the party entitled to such contribution. In this connection, each Guarantor has the right to waive its contribution right against any Guarantor to the extent that after giving effect to such waiver such Guarantor would remain solvent, in the determination of the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders.
21.

.
This Guaranty may be executed in any number of counterparts and by the different parties hereto on separate counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be an original, but all of which shall together constitute one and the same instrument.
