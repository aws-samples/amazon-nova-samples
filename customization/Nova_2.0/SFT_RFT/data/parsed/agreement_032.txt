Agreement for Sale and Purchase of the Receivables
2.1
On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and provided that the requirements of Clause
3.1 have been satisfied by each of the Seller and the Purchaser, the Seller may offer to sell and assign to the Purchaser all of the right, title and interest (present or future) in, and to, Receivables (and their Related Rights) owned by it from
time to time by delivering a Sale Notice to the Purchaser from time to time, and the Purchaser shall be obliged to accept each such offer, and to purchase and accept the assignment of all such right, title and interest, provided that the Purchase
Conditions are satisfied as at the applicable Sale Notice Date or waived by the Purchaser. No notice of any such sale and purchase shall be given to Borrowers save in the circumstances set out in Clause 7 (
Notification of
Sales
).
2.2
The Seller shall on each Sale Notice Date deliver to the Purchaser and the Class C Lender at or before
the delivery of each Sale Notice (i) the daily report referred to in Clause 7.1A.(a) of the Receivables Management Agreement due on such date and (ii) the weekly report referred to in Clause 7.1A.(c) of the Receivables Management Agreement
setting out Portfolio data as at close of business as recorded in the System on the last Business Day of the prior calendar week.
2.3
The Parties agree that in respect of Receivables (other than Further Disbursements in respect of which
Clause 2.12 applies):
5|159
(a)
delivery of each Sale Notice from the Seller to the Purchaser constitutes confirmation by the Seller that
each Purchase Condition (other than the Purchase Condition set out in Clause 2.5(f)) is satisfied on the relevant Sale Notice Date in respect of the Receivables set out in such Sale Notice as such Receivables may be updated and amended by the
related Confirmation Notice;
(b)
the Seller shall deliver a Confirmation Notice to the Purchaser no later than two Business Days following
the latest
Cut-Off
Time for such Receivables specified in the relevant Sale Notice;

on the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, the Seller hereby agrees to sell and the
Purchaser hereby agrees to purchase and accept the purchase of the Receivables specified in a Confirmation Notice on the applicable Payment Date; and
(d)
all right, title and interest in and to each Receivable, together with all Related Rights in relation to
such Receivable, to be sold by the Seller to the Purchaser will be transferred to the Purchaser immediately upon receipt by the Seller of the applicable Purchase Price in full (provided that it is agreed that such transfer will only be required to
be reflected in the System as soon as is reasonably practicable after the receipt by the Seller of the applicable Purchase Price).
2.4
The Purchaser agrees that (i) the Seller will modify the list of Receivables specified in a Sale Notice
so as to amend the balance of the Receivables specified to reflect the balance in the System as at the applicable
Cut-Off
Time or to remove from a list those Receivables in relation to which one or more of the
Eligibility Criteria were no longer satisfied as at the
Cut-Off
Time in respect of the relevant Receivables, and (ii) the final list of Receivables transferred to the Purchaser on the Title Transfer Time
shall be evidenced by the Confirmation Notice delivered by the Seller no later than [***] Business Days following the latest
Cut-Off
Time for the Receivables specified in the relevant Sale Notice. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Seller shall not be permitted to add new Receivables to the Confirmation Notice which were not previously included in the related Sale Notice.
2.5
In respect of a Receivable set out in a Sale Notice (save for any Further Disbursements (in relation to
which, Clause 2.12 shall apply)), the Purchaser’s acceptance to purchase such Receivable is conditional on all of the following conditions (the
Purchase Conditions
) being satisfied or waived by the Purchaser in relation to such
Receivable:

the relevant Sale Notice Date is within the Commitment Period;
(b)
the Repeating Representations are true in all respects as at the Sale Notice Date and will be true in all
respects as at the Title Transfer Time;
(c)
the Seller is not in material breach of its obligations under this Agreement as at the Sale Notice Date and
will not be in material breach of its obligations under this Agreement as at the Title Transfer Time, in each case which (in the case only of a material breach caused by an error or omission of an administrative, personnel, system, technical or
operational nature) has not been remedied within ten Business Days;
6|159
(d)
in relation to Receivables to be added to the Portfolio which are specified in a Sale Notice, the
Concentration Limits in respect of the portfolio of those Receivables set out in such Sale Notice (each a
Sale Notice Portfolio
) and the Portfolio (taking into account the addition of the Sale Notice Portfolio) are satisfied as at the
relevant Sale Notice Date applicable to such Receivables;
(e)
in relation to Receivables to be added to the Portfolio which are specified in a Sale Notice, the aggregate
of:
(i)
in respect of Receivables arising from Loan Agreements which are fully disbursed as at the relevant Sale
Notice Date, the aggregate of the Euro Equivalent Principal Balance of such Receivables (calculated using the spot rate of exchange for the purchase of Euro in the London foreign exchange market as determined by the Seller as at 11:00am on the Spot
Rate Determination Date) on the date of the Sale Notice setting out such Receivables; and
(ii)
in respect of Receivables arising from Loan Agreements which are not fully disbursed as at the relevant Sale
Notice Date, the aggregate of the Euro Equivalent Original Commitment Amount (less the amount of any repayments which the Borrower has made in accordance with the Loan Agreement) of such Receivables (calculated using the spot rate of exchange for
the purchase of Euro in the London foreign exchange market as determined by the Seller as at 11:00am on the Spot Rate Determination Date) on the date of the Sale Notice setting out such Receivables,
is less than or equal to the Available Commitment as at the Sale Notice Date; and
(f)
the Purchaser having funds available to it for the payment of the Purchase Price in accordance with the
Transaction Documents on the Payment Date when payment of such Purchase Price is due.
2.6
Subject to Clause 8.18, the Purchaser will obtain the right to receive all Collections in connection with
the Receivables set out in the applicable Sale Notice (as updated and amended by the Confirmation Notice) and transferred to the Purchaser pursuant to Clause 2.3(d) from the applicable
Cut-Off
Time save to the
extent and until such Receivable has been repurchased by the Seller or has been the subject of an indemnity payment by the Seller in each case in accordance with Clause 8. The Purchaser shall pay on the relevant Payment Date the Purchase Price for
any Receivables specified by the Seller in a Confirmation Notice in accordance with Clause 4.2.
7|159
2.7
The Seller agrees that, save as otherwise agreed with the Class C Lender, from and after the first Sale
Notice Date during the Commitment Period:
(a)
at any time when the Available Commitment is greater than Euro Equivalent [***], it will on each Sale Notice
Date offer to sell all Eligible Receivables that are not [***] or [***] originated during the Commitment Period (and not previously sold to the Purchaser) to the Purchaser, in the amount necessary to enable the Available Commitment to be reduced to
zero after giving effect to their purchase, or until all such offered Eligible Receivables are purchased by the Purchaser, whichever is the limiting condition;
(b)
at any time during the Commitment Period, it will not, and it will procure that none of its Affiliates
shall, offer or agree to sell any Eligible Receivables that are not [***] to any party other than the Purchaser; and
(c)
if paragraph (30) of the Eligibility Criteria is not satisfied, at any time during the Relevant
Notarisation Period, it will not, and it will procure that none of its Affiliates shall, offer or agree to sell any Spanish Receivables to any party other than the Purchaser,
provided that at any time, the Seller and/or any of its Affiliates shall be entitled to sell any Receivable to any other party
where either: (i) such Receivable cannot be sold to the Purchaser at the relevant time under this Clause 2 because at that time such Receivable did not satisfy the Eligibility Criteria and any applicable Eligibility Criteria have not been
agreed to be waived by both the Purchaser and the Seller (except that the Seller and the Purchaser agree that paragraphs (7) and (8) of the Eligibility Criteria cannot be waived or otherwise amended); (ii) the Seller is not permitted to sell
such Receivable at such time to the Purchaser as a result of the Purchase Condition set out in Clause 2.5(d) and the Seller has requested a waiver of the applicable Concentration Limit(s) and such Concentration Limit(s) have not been waived within
15 Business Days of such request; or (iii) subject to Clause 2.8, the relevant Receivable cannot be sold to the Purchaser at such time as a result of the Purchase Condition set out in Clause 2.5(e) not being satisfied. For the avoidance of
doubt, nothing in this Clause 2.7 shall require the Seller to sell, or make an offer to sell in respect of, any [***] or restrict the Seller and/or any of its Affiliates from selling an [***] to any person.
2.8
[***]
2.9
[***]
8|159
2.10
It shall be a term of the sale of each of the Receivables and any Related Rights referred to in Clause 2.1
that the Seller shall sell and assign to the Purchaser all right, title, interest and benefit of the Seller (both present and future) in, to and under the relevant Receivables and any Related Rights (but without notice of such sale and purchase
being given to Borrowers prior to the occurrence of a Notification Event), including for the avoidance of doubt:
(a)
all sums of principal, interest or any other sum payable under such Receivables on or after or in respect of
any period on or after the relevant

Time and the right to demand, sue for, recover, receive and give receipts for all such sums;

Receivable and any Related Rights and the right to exercise all powers of the Seller in relation to each such Receivable and any Related Rights;
(c)
all arrears payable under or in connection with the relevant Receivable; and
(d)
all net proceeds (after any applicable costs and expenses that are agreed may be deducted in accordance with
the terms of the Receivables Management Agreement) from the enforcement of the relevant Receivables and any Related Rights,
provided that (i) at no time prior to the provision of a Borrower Notice will identifiable Personal Data be transferred or
otherwise made available to the Purchaser in respect of any Receivables or Borrowers thereunder; (ii) the benefit and/or the right to receive any interest accrued prior to the relevant
Cut-Off
Time shall
not be transferred to the Purchaser in respect of any Receivables; and (iii) the benefit and/or the right to receive any NSF Fee applicable in respect of any Receivable shall not be transferred to the Purchaser.
9|159
2.11
The Parties confirm that each sale of Receivables and any Related Rights in accordance with this Agreement
is:
(a)
intended to constitute a true sale of those Receivables and Related Rights and not a loan or a security
arrangement for any obligation of the Seller; and
(b)
to the knowledge of the Seller, not a transaction at an undervalue, a gratuitous alienation, a fraudulent
conveyance, a voidable or unfair preference or the equivalent thereof under the insolvency laws of any jurisdiction.
The Purchaser shall be free to further dispose of any Purchased Receivables and Related Rights subject to (i) the Security
Interests created by, and any restrictions to which it is subject under, the Security Documents; (ii) Clause 20.3 of this Agreement; and (iii) any other Transaction Document, provided always that the Purchaser and any subsequent purchaser
or transferee of the Purchased Receivables undertakes and agrees that notice of any sale and purchase will not be given to Borrowers prior to the occurrence of a Notification Event.
2.12
In respect of any Further Disbursement which is contemplated to be made in connection with any Loan
Agreement in respect of which any Receivable is included in a Confirmation Notice before the end of the Commitment Period, it is hereby agreed that the Seller shall sell and the Purchaser shall purchase such Further Disbursement. Subject to Clause
2.13 and provided that the title to the Receivable to which such Further Disbursement relates has been transferred to the Purchaser, such Further Disbursement will be sold and transferred to the Purchaser in accordance with the completion provisions
set out in Clause 6.2 and title to such Further Disbursement shall be transferred by the Seller to the Purchaser immediately upon such Further Disbursement arising. The Seller shall deliver a Further Disbursement Confirmation Notice to the Purchaser
no later than three Business Days after the applicable Title Transfer Time evidencing the final amount of the Further Disbursement transferred to the Purchaser at such Title Transfer Time.
2.13
If in the period between the date of delivery of a Sale Notice and the [***] Business Day after the relevant
Sale Notice Date during which title for the relevant Receivables specified in such Sale Notice has not been transferred, Further Disbursements related to such Receivables specified in the relevant Sale Notice have arisen, such Further Disbursement
will only be sold and title transferred to the Purchaser with effect from the Title Transfer Time of the related Receivable included in such relevant Sale Notice.
2.14
Each Receivable (and its Related Rights) shall be sold subject to and in accordance with the terms and
subject to the conditions of this Agreement and the Relevant Local Schedule for such Receivable. In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the Relevant Local Schedule, the terms of the Relevant Local Schedule shall
prevail.
2.15

transfer of any Receivables and Related Rights in favour of the Purchaser;
(b)
the Receivables comprising the Portfolio or any material part thereof being in danger of being seized or

purposes of the Transaction Documents in respect of that Receivable or Receivables owned by Borrowers in that Relevant Jurisdiction and accordingly, for the avoidance of doubt, no notice of assignment, or of its interest in, any Receivable or
Related Rights owed by another Borrower or by Borrowers in another Relevant Jurisdiction (as the case may be) shall be required or permitted to be given under the terms of this Clause 7 unless a Notification Event has occurred in that other Relevant

of its interest in, any Receivable or any Related Rights, the Seller must notify the Borrower of that Receivable, court, regulatory authority and/or organisation of the transfer of that Receivable and Related Rights to the Purchaser;

receivables managing party it has engaged to provide, formal notice to (i) all of the Borrowers in the case of a Notification Event as listed in Clauses 7.1(b), 7.1(d), 7.1(e) or 7.1(f); or (ii) the Borrowers in any Relevant Jurisdiction

The Seller undertakes to the Purchaser and the Security Agent that, for so long as a Borrower Notice has not
been given, the Seller will lend its name to, and take such other steps as may reasonably be required by the Purchaser or (as applicable) the Purchaser acting on the instructions of the Security Agent in relation to, any legal proceedings in respect
of the Receivables and their Related Rights in accordance with any applicable law or regulation.
7.5
Subject to Clause 7.6 (
Undertakings of the Seller
), upon being required to do so by the Security
Agent (following the service of an Enforcement Notice) pursuant to and at all times in accordance with this Clause 7, the Purchaser shall do all or any of the acts, matters or things referred to in this Clause 7, and undertakes not to take any
action that would result in the notification to any Borrower of the transfer of the Receivables and their Related Rights to the Purchaser except as provided in this Agreement and pursuant to and in accordance with this Clause 7 and Clause 23
(
Data Protection
).
7.6
Undertakings of the Seller
(a)
Following a Notification Event, the Seller undertakes in respect of each Receivable then forming part of the
Portfolio and in respect of which a Notification Event applies, that it will, at its own expense upon receipt of a request from the Purchaser or the Security Agent thereof in writing, do and complete all such acts and execute any necessary

if after the relevant Settlement Date it receives written notice of any litigation or claim calling into
question in any material respect the Seller’s or the Purchaser’s title to any Receivable or the right to payment thereunder or the validity, collectability or enforceability of any Receivable, or if it receives after the relevant
Settlement Date written notice of any judgment which would have a material adverse effect on the Seller’s or the Purchaser’s title to any Receivable or the right to payment thereunder, or if it becomes aware of any material breach of any
of its undertakings and other obligations under this Agreement to notify the Purchaser and the Security Agent of such notice on or before the next Monthly Reporting Date (or the following Monthly Reporting Date if such notice is received within 15
Business Days of the next Monthly Reporting Date); and
(ii)
if reasonably required so to do by the Purchaser or the Security Agent, and at the Purchaser’s
expense, to participate or join in any legal proceedings to the extent necessary in defending or contesting any litigation calling into question in any way the Purchaser’s title to any Receivable.
(c)
The Seller agrees that it will not act or omit to act in any way which:
(i)
would adversely affect in any material respect the position of the Purchaser or its creditors in relation to
the Receivables forming part of the Portfolio from time to time after their respective Title Transfer Time; or
(ii)
would constitute a breach in any material respect of the Seller’s obligations under the related Loan
Agreements,
unless in each case such act, omission or amendment is necessary in order for the Seller to
comply with applicable law, regulation, decree or other ordinance issued by any governmental, state or other authority having jurisdiction over it.
(d)
The Seller shall ensure that all Loan Agreements and documents in respect of the origination of the Loan
Agreements relating to Receivables comply with all applicable laws, regulation, decree, other ordinance and Authorisations required in the Relevant Jurisdiction and in Luxembourg to the extent that any

, in reliance thereon and have relied upon the representations and

20|159

transaction contemplated by this Agreement and has such information as it deems appropriate under the circumstances (however obtained) to make an informed decision regarding such transaction. The Purchaser hereby agrees that it has independently

express representation or warranty made by the Seller in this Agreement).
8.5
Breach of Loan Warranties
Subject to Clause 8.7, in respect of any breach of any Loan Warranty as at the date specified in Clause 8.1 (
Seller
Representations and Loan Warranties
) (save for any breach of a Loan Warranty arising as a result of confirmed Borrower fraud which is separately provided for in Clause 8.15) where the sum of the (i) aggregate Purchase Price of any affected
Receivables (including the aggregate Purchase Price of Receivables affected by a breach of Loan Warranty which may have already been repurchased in previous years), and (ii) any Indemnified Amounts (as defined in the Receivables Management
Agreement) owing by the Receivables Manager to the Purchaser under clause 16 of the Receivables Management Agreement (or which have previously been paid by the Receivables Manager under such clause), is less than or equal to the then applicable
Threshold Amount (determined as at the time of each relevant breach), the Seller shall notify the Purchaser and the Security Agent of any actual breach of a Loan Warranty (i) if the breach is not capable of remedy, on or before the next Monthly
Reporting Date after the Seller becomes aware of such breach; or (ii) if the breach is capable of remedy and such breach has not been remedied within 90 calendar days of the Seller becoming aware of such breach, on or before the next Monthly
Reporting Date following the date falling 90 calendar days after date on which the Seller becomes aware of such breach.
8.6
For so long as the aggregate Purchase Price of Receivables affected by a breach of any Loan Warranty (other
than a breach of a Loan Warranty arising as a result of any confirmed Borrower fraud) when aggregated with any Indemnified Amounts (as defined in the Receivables Management Agreement) owing by the Receivables Manager to the Purchaser under clause 16
of the Receivables Management Agreement does not exceed the then applicable Threshold Amount (determined as at the time of each relevant breach), the Seller shall not be required to indemnify the Purchaser in respect of such breaches or repurchase
any affected Receivables.
8.7
The Seller shall only be obliged to indemnify the Purchaser in respect of, or repurchase, any Receivable
affected by a breach of Loan Warranty if such breach of Loan Warranty is identified prior to the date falling 12 months after the latest scheduled Payment Date of any Purchased Receivable.
8.8
In respect of each of the Loan Warranties at paragraphs 3, 6(a), 7, and 16 of Part A of Schedule 2 (
Loan
Warranties
) given in respect of a Receivable, no breach of such Loan Warranty shall occur (and, for the avoidance of doubt, the Seller shall not be obliged to notify of any such breach or indemnify for, or repurchase, any affected Receivable)
unless (i) the relevant Loan Warranty was not correct as at the date on which such Loan Warranty was made and (ii) such incorrectness has, or is reasonably likely to have, an adverse effect on the value of such Receivable, taking into
account the likelihood of recoverability of that Receivable.
21|159
8.9
In respect of the Loan Warranty at paragraph 19 of Part A of Schedule 2 (
Loan
Warranties
), a
breach of such Loan Warranty shall be considered to have been
remedied for the purposes of Clause 8.5 (
Breach of Loan Warranties
) (and, for the avoidance of doubt, the Seller shall not be obliged to notify of any such breach or
indemnify for, or repurchase, any affected Receivable) if the Seller has paid, or reimbursed to the Purchaser (as applicable), the full amount of the relevant registration, stamp, or other similar Tax or duty and any associated interest and/or
penalties within 90 calendar days of the Seller becoming aware of such registration, stamp, or other similar Tax or duty (or such longer period as the Parties may agree).
8.10
Repurchase for breach of Loan Warranties
(a)
Subject to Clause 8.7 and Clause 8.17, if the aggregate Purchase Price of Receivables affected by a breach
of any Loan Warranty exceeds the Threshold Amount (determined as at the time of each relevant breach), the Seller shall be obliged, during the period during which the sum of (i) the aggregate Purchase Price of Receivables affected by a breach
of any Loan Warranty (including the aggregate Purchase Price of Receivables affected by a breach of Loan Warranty which may have already been repurchased in previous years), and (ii) any Indemnified Amounts (as defined in the Receivables
Management Agreement) owing by the Receivables Manager to the Purchaser under clause 16 of the Receivables Management Agreement (or which have previously been paid by the Receivables Manager under such clause) exceeds the then applicable Threshold
Amount, at its discretion either to effect a repurchase of the Receivables subject to the breach of Loan Warranties pursuant to this Clause 8.10 (
Repurchase for breach of
Loan Warranties
) or compensate the Purchaser by making an
indemnity
payment to the Purchaser pursuant to Clause 8.17. For the avoidance of doubt if the aggregate Purchase Price of Receivables then affected by a breach of a Loan Warranty exceeds the Threshold Amount, the Seller shall be required to
either repurchase from, or indemnify, the Purchaser for all Purchased Receivables then affected by a breach of Loan Warranty and not just those in excess of the Threshold Amount. If the Seller has elected to repurchase such affected Receivables, the
Seller shall deliver a written notice to the Purchaser specifying its election, following which the Purchaser (or the Receivables Manager on behalf of the Purchaser) shall by delivery of a Repurchase Notice to the Seller (copied to the Purchaser,
the Receivables Manager and the Security Agent) reassign and retransfer to the Seller its Assigned Rights in relation to such Receivable identified in the relevant Repurchase Notice on the next following Settlement Date (if during the Commitment
Period) or Monthly Reporting Date (if after the end of the Commitment Period) after the date on which the breach of Loan Warranty is required to be notified in accordance with Clause 8.5, and the Seller shall accept a reassignment and retransfer of
such Assigned Rights. Such reassignment and retransfer shall be in accordance with, and for the consideration set out in, Clause 8.13.
(b)
The Seller may (in its absolute discretion) elect to indemnify the Purchaser as an alternative to the
reassignment and retransfer to the Seller of the Purchaser’s Assigned Rights in relation to a Receivable pursuant to Clause 8.17.
22|159
8.11
The Security Agent shall be entitled to assume that no such breach has occurred until it has been so
notified in writing by the Seller or the Receivables Manager. For the avoidance of doubt, save as provided in Clause 8.10 and Clause 8.17 there shall be no other consequence for any breach of Loan Warranty relating to such Receivables and no action
shall be taken by any Party in respect of such breach.
Completion and Consideration
8.12
Each reassignment and retransfer under this Clause 8 shall be free from any right or interest that the
Security Agent may have in the Assigned Rights under or pursuant to the Security Documents (which the Security Agent shall release, discharge or reassign in respect of the Assigned Rights so reassigned and retransferred).
8.13
Completion of such reassignment and retransfer under Clause 8.10 and Clause 8.12 (inclusive) shall take
place on the Repurchase Date applicable to the relevant Repurchase Notice upon payment by the Seller to the Purchaser into the Purchaser Bank Account in the relevant currency of the Repurchase Price. Any such payment by the Seller of the Repurchase
Price shall, in relation to that Receivable only, constitute a discharge and release of the Seller from any claims which the Purchaser or the Security Agent may have against it arising from or in relation to such breach of warranty, but shall not
affect any rights arising from a breach of any express provision of this Agreement in relation to any other Receivable. The Purchaser and the Security Agent shall, to the extent that each has title and at the cost of the Seller, execute and deliver
an agreement in respect of the reassignment, retrocession and release of any such Receivable specified in the relevant Repurchase Notice, in such form as the Seller may reasonably require against payment therefor by the Seller of the Repurchase
Price. Each repurchase, reassignment and retransfer of Receivables shall be made subject to and in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and the provisions of the Relevant Local Schedule for such Receivable (to
the extent applicable and applying mutatis mutandis as required in order to transfer legal and beneficial title to such Receivable back to the Seller).
8.14
If the Seller makes any payment (not involving a reassignment or retransfer under this Clause 8) to the
Purchaser or the Security Agent in full satisfaction of any claim made by the Purchaser or the Security Agent in relation to any warranty set out in Clause 8.1 (
Seller Representations and Loan Warranties
), the Purchaser or the Security Agent,
as the case may be, shall assign to the Seller such rights as they have against any third party which relate to such claim and undertakes to reassign or retransfer any Assigned Rights upon request by the Seller.
8.15
Repurchase for Failure of Bank-Funded Payment and Fraud
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Clause 8, if, after a Receivable has been transferred from the Seller to the
Purchaser, the Seller receives notice that:
(a)
any payment made by the Borrower has failed or is subject to a reversal or chargeback (each a
Payment
Unwind
) where such Payment Unwind is in respect of any payment on the Loan Agreement prior to the Cut-Off Time and where, if such Payment Unwind had occurred prior to the Cut-Off Time, such Receivable would not have been an Eligible
Receivable; or
(b)
a confirmed Borrower fraud has occurred in respect of such Receivable prior to the Cut-Off Time of such
Receivable,
the Seller shall repurchase such affected Receivable for an amount equal to the Purchase
Price paid by the Purchaser for such Receivable less the aggregate amount of any Collections transferred to the Purchaser in respect of such affected Receivable plus Cost of Capital [* * *]. The Receivables Manager on behalf of the
Purchaser shall by delivery of a Repurchase Notice to the Seller (copied to the Purchaser, the Receivables Manager and the Security Agent) reassign and retransfer to the Seller its Assigned Rights in relation to such Receivable identified in the
relevant Repurchase Notice as soon as is reasonably practicable after the date on which the Seller receives notice of the Payment Unwind or the confirmed Borrower fraud (as applicable) but in any event by no later than the Monthly Reporting Date
applicable to the Reporting Period in which the Seller receives notice of the Payment Unwind or the confirmed Borrower fraud (as applicable), and the Seller shall accept a reassignment and retransfer of such Assigned Rights. Completion of such
re-assignment and re-transfer shall take place on the Repurchase Date applicable to the relevant Repurchase Notice upon payment by the Seller to the Purchaser into the Purchaser Bank Account in the relevant currency of the original Purchase Price.
The Purchaser and the Security Agent shall, to the extent that each has title and at the cost of the Seller, execute and deliver an agreement in respect of the reassignment and retransfer of any such Receivable specified in the relevant Repurchase
Notice, in such form as the Seller may reasonably require against payment therefor by the Seller of the original Purchase Price less the aggregate amount of any Collections transferred to the Purchaser in respect of such Receivable plus Cost of
Capital. Each repurchase, reassignment and retransfer of such Receivable shall be made subject to and in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement and the provisions of the Relevant Local Schedule for such Receivable
(to the extent applicable and applying mutatis mutandis as required in order to transfer legal and beneficial title to such Receivable back to the Seller).

(a)
the Seller elects to indemnify the Purchaser as an alternative to the reassignment and retransfer to the
Seller of the Purchaser’s Assigned Rights in relation to a Receivable under Clause 8.10 (
Repurchase for breach of Loan
Warranties
);
(b)
a Receivable has never existed, or has ceased to exist, such that it is not outstanding on the date on which
it is due to be reassigned or retransferred pursuant to this Clause 8;
(c)
a Loss has been suffered in respect of such Receivable due to a fraud on behalf of the Seller; or
(d)
the Seller is not obliged to repurchase a Purchased Receivable that it would otherwise have been obliged to
repurchase pursuant to Clause 8.10 (
Repurchase for breach of Loan Warranties
) due solely to a matter being Disclosed in the Disclosure Letter,
the Seller shall not be obliged to repurchase the Receivable or the other Assigned Rights but shall instead deliver a written
notice on the date on which the next Sale Notice is delivered (or, if sales are no longer occurring, within five Business Days) after becoming aware that any of the circumstances referred to under Clauses 8.17(a), (b), (c) or (d) has occurred
specifying its intention to indemnify the Purchaser in relation to such Receivable or other Assigned Rights in an amount equal to the Repurchase Price that would be payable under Clause 8.13 had the Seller elected to repurchase that Receivable (the
Indemnification Amount
). After delivery of such written notice, the Seller shall, within five Business Days of delivery of such written notice, indemnify the Purchaser in an amount equal to the Indemnification Amount for the relevant
Receivable and pay such Indemnification Amount to the Purchaser, provided that the Seller shall be entitled to settle the payment of any such Indemnification Amount by way of
set-off
and deduction from the
Purchase Price specified in the next Confirmation Notice following delivery of such written notice (where applicable).
8.18
Following the payment or settlement of an Indemnification Amount pursuant to Clause 8.17, any Collections
received in respect of the Indemnification Amount of the affected Receivable(s) shall be retained by the Seller for its own account.
8.19

(a)
in respect of that part of the Repurchase Price amount calculated by reference to the relevant Purchase
Price Ratio multiplied by the outstanding Current Balance of the relevant Receivable, within five Business Days of the date on which the balance of the Receivable is written down or reduced; and
(b)
in respect of that part of the Repurchase Price calculated by reference to Cost of Capital, on the next
Monthly Settlement Date.

8.20
Anti-dilution
(a)
If the balance of a Receivable (in whole or in part, including in respect of any amounts representing
interest or fees) is written down by the Seller or the Receivables Manager or any interest, fees or other amounts due are waived as a result of the Seller or the Receivables Manager determining that there has been an error in the origination,
management or administration of a particular loan or making a goodwill credit to a particular Borrower, the Seller shall not be obliged to repurchase the Receivable or the other Assigned Rights but shall instead make an anti-dilution payment to the
Purchaser Bank Account in the relevant currency equal to the Repurchase Price in respect of the amount of the Receivable balance so written down or waived. Such anti-dilution payment shall be settled on a monthly basis in arrears on the Monthly
Settlement Date by way of a cash payment from the Seller to the Purchaser, payment of which shall be satisfied, during the Commitment Period only and provided that the Receivables Manager as at the date of this Agreement (or any of its Affiliates)
remains a Receivables Manager under the Receivables Management Agreement, by way of
set-off
against the Receivables Management Fee or any other fees at that time then due pursuant to the Receivables Management
Agreement, or if such fees are insufficient for any reason, by payment by the Seller within five Business Days of demand from the Purchaser.
(b)
If the balance of a Receivable (in whole or in part, including in respect of any amounts representing
interest or fees) is written down by the Seller as a form of provisional credit granted to a Borrower pursuant to an unresolved dispute between the relevant Borrower and the relevant merchant, the Seller shall not be obliged to repurchase the
Receivable or the other Assigned Rights but shall instead make an anti-dilution payment to the Purchaser by a transfer to the Purchaser Bank Account in the relevant currency of an amount equal to the Repurchase Price in respect of the amount of the
Receivable balance so written down (excluding any amounts of interest or fees cancelled in connection with the grant of the provisional credit). If following the conclusion of the dispute between such Borrower and such merchant, the dispute is
resolved against the Borrower and the write-down of the applicable Receivable balance is reversed, the Purchaser shall make a payment of an amount equal to such Repurchase Price transferred to the Purchaser, payment of which shall be satisfied by
way of
set-off
against the Collections Sweep Payments which otherwise are required to be made to the Purchaser at that time or if such Collection Sweep Payments are insufficient to satisfy such payment in
full, by payment by the Purchaser within five Business Days of demand by the Seller.
(c)
If the balance of a Receivable (in whole or in part, including in respect of any amounts representing
interest or fees) is written down by the Seller upon a refund being received by the Seller from the relevant merchant in respect of the underlying merchant purchase transaction, the Seller shall not be obliged to repurchase the Receivable or the
other Assigned Rights but shall instead make an anti-dilution payment to the Purchaser by a transfer of the amount to the Purchaser Bank Account in the relevant
26|159
currency equal to the Repurchase Price in respect of the amount of the Receivable balance so written down (excluding any amounts of interest or fees cancelled in connection with the grant of the
refund). If the Seller notifies the Purchaser that the Borrower has previously made a payment in whole or in part (and the Purchaser has received such payment), where the issuance of the refund has resulted in a credit to such Borrower’s
e-money
account such that the Borrower has no right of
set-off
or counterclaim against the Receivable in respect of the amount so credited (such amount, an
E-money
Refund Balance Amount
), an amount equal to the
E-money
Refund Balance Amount shall be netted against the Collections Sweep Payment which otherwise are required
to be made to the Purchaser at that time such that the Seller can restore the original balance of the Borrower’s
e-money
account.
(d)
If the balance of a Receivable (in whole or in part, including in respect of any amounts representing
interest or fees) is reduced as a result of a Borrower exercising a right of
set-off,
recission or right of counterclaim against such Receivable, the Seller shall not be obliged to repurchase the Receivable or
the other Assigned Rights but shall instead make an anti-dilution payment to the Purchaser by a transfer to the Purchaser Bank Account in the relevant currency of an amount equal to the Repurchase Price in respect of the amount of the Receivable
balance so reduced.
(e)
Any payments to be made by the Seller pursuant to Clauses 8.20(b), (c) and (d) shall be made:
(i)
in respect of that part of the Repurchase Price amount calculated by reference to the relevant Purchase
Price Ratio multiplied by the written down or reduced amount of the balance of the relevant Receivable, within five Business Days of the date on which the balance of the Receivable is written down or reduced; and
(ii)
in respect of that part of the Repurchase Price calculated by reference to Cost of Capital, on the next
Monthly Settlement Date during the Commitment Period or after the end of the Commitment Period on a Monthly Reporting Date.
8.21
Balance Adjustments
(a)
If the balance of a Receivable increases (after the Receivable has been transferred to the Purchaser) as a
result of a Payment Unwind of any due payment requested by the Borrower (other than as described in Clause 8.15(a)) and where a Collection has been paid to the Purchaser in respect of such payment, the Purchaser shall pay to the Seller an amount
equal to such increase in the balance of the Receivable, payment of which shall be satisfied by way of
set-off
against the Collections Sweep Payments which otherwise are required to be made to the Purchaser at
that time.
(b)
If any NSF Fee has been passed on to the Purchaser in the System, the Purchaser shall pay to the Seller an
amount equal to such NSF Fee. Such payment shall be settled on a monthly basis in arrears on each Monthly Settlement Date by way of
set-off
against the Collections Sweep Payments
27|159
which otherwise are required to be made to the Purchaser at that time, or if such Collection Sweep Payments are insufficient, by payment by the Purchaser within five Business Days of demand from
the Seller. In relation to any amounts received from a Borrower, these will be allocated first to the satisfaction of any payment due in respect of a NSF Fee (which amount shall be retained by the Seller for its own account), and thereafter in
accordance with the terms of the Loan Agreement and any applicable law or regulation.
8.22
It is hereby expressly understood between the Parties that, since the Receivables are sold to the Purchaser
without recourse (but for the avoidance of doubt without prejudice to any recourse as expressly provided for in this Agreement), the Seller shall have no obligation to indemnify the Purchaser from any direct and/or indirect damages, Losses, Taxes,
claims, liabilities, costs and expenses arising as a consequence of the failure by any Borrower to pay in whole or in part any relevant Receivables after the relevant
Cut-Off
Time (including, without
limitation, as a result of the insolvency of such Borrower). Without prejudice to the other provisions of this Clause 8, each of the Purchaser and the Security Agent further acknowledges to and agrees with the Seller, that the Seller shall have no
liability or responsibility (whether, in either case, contractual or tortious, express or implied) for any Loss or damage for or in respect of any breach of or any act or omission in respect of, any of its obligations hereunder other than Loss or
damage directly (and not indirectly or consequentially) suffered by the Purchaser and/or the Security Agent or the assets comprised in the Transaction Security by reason of such breach, act or omission.
8.23
Each of the Seller and the Purchaser shall notify in writing the applicable Party within seven Business Days
of becoming aware of the breach of any of its obligations under this Clause 8 (including whilst any relevant cure period is in effect) and each of the Seller, the Purchaser and the Security Agent shall, in the absence of receipt of any such written
notice, be entitled to assume that each Party is complying with such obligations.

) will apply) and in any event within seven
Business Days of becoming aware of its occurrence. Without prejudice to the other rights and remedies of the Parties to this Agreement set out herein, following such notification, to the extent that such breach is capable of remedy, the Purchaser
and the Seller agree to consult with each other and negotiate in good faith to agree a means to remedy and resolve such breach. Promptly upon a request by any party to this Agreement to the Purchaser or the Seller, the Purchaser or the Seller (as
