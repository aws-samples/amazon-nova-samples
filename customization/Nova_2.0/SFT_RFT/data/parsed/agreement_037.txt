Exhibit 4.6
DESCRIPTION OF SECURITIES
Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the meaning ascribed to them in the Annual Report on Form 10-K to which this Description of Securities is an exhibit.
(a)
Capital Stock
Common Stock, $0.001 par value per share
As of September 30, 2025, we had 22,593,069 shares of common stock outstanding. All shares of our common stock have equal rights as to earnings, assets, dividends and voting privileges and, when issued, will be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. Shares of our common stock have no preemptive, conversion or redemption rights and are freely transferable, except where their transfer is restricted by federal and state securities laws.
Distributions may be paid to the holders of our common stock if, as and when authorized by our Board of Directors and declared by us out of funds legally available therefor. In the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, each share of our common stock is entitled to share ratably in all of our assets that are legally available for distribution after we pay all debts and other liabilities and subject to any preferential rights of holders of our preferred stock, if any is outstanding at the time. Each share of our common stock is entitled to one vote and does not have cumulative voting rights, which means that holders of a majority of such shares, if they so choose, could elect all of the directors, and holders of less than a majority of such shares would, in that case, be unable to elect any director. Our common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Global Select Market (“Nasdaq”) under the ticker symbol “GLAD.”
6.25% Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share
(“Series A Preferred Stock”)
As of September 30, 2025, we had 865,452 shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding.
At the time of issuance, the Series A Preferred Stock will be fully paid and non‑assessable and will have no preemptive, conversion, or exchange rights or rights to cumulative voting. The Series A Preferred Stock will rank equally with shares of all other series of preferred stock (collectively, “Preferred Stock”) that we may issue in the future as to payment of dividends and the distribution of our assets upon dissolution, liquidation or winding up of our affairs. The Series A Preferred Stock is, and all other Preferred Stock that we may issue in the future will be, senior as to dividends and distributions to our common stock. We may issue additional series of Preferred Stock in the future. The Series A Preferred Stock will be effectively subordinated to our existing and future indebtedness, including the Notes and borrowings under the Credit Facility.
The following summary of the terms and provisions of the Series A Preferred Stock does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the pertinent sections of our charter including the articles supplementary (the “Articles Supplementary”), which supplement our charter by classifying the Series A Preferred Stock.
Dividends
Holders of shares of the Series A Preferred Stock (“Shares”) will be entitled to receive, when, as and if authorized by our Board of Directors (or a duly authorized committee of the board) and declared by us, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends, preferential cumulative cash dividends at the rate of 6.25% per annum of the Liquidation Preference (equivalent to a fixed annual amount of $1.5625 per share) (the “Dividend Rate”). Dividends on shares of the Series A Preferred Stock will accrue and be paid on the basis of a 360‑day year consisting of twelve 30‑day months. Dividends on outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock will accrue and be cumulative from the end of the most recent dividend period for which dividends have been paid or, if no dividends have been paid and except as otherwise provided in the following sentence, from the date of issuance. If a share of Series A Preferred Stock is issued after the record date for the dividend period in which such share is issued, dividends on such share will accrue and be cumulative from the beginning of the first dividend period commencing after its issuance. Dividends will be payable monthly in arrears, on or about the fifth day of each month for dividends accrued the previous month or such other date as our Board of Directors may designate, to holders of
record as they appear in our stock records at the close of business on the applicable record date. The record date for each dividend will be designated by our Board of Directors and will be a date that is prior to the dividend payment date. We currently anticipate the record date will be on or about the 25th of each month, but such date is subject to determination by our Board of Directors.
Ranking
The Series A Preferred Stock will rank, with respect to dividend rights and rights upon our liquidation, winding‑up or dissolution:
•
senior to our common stock in priority of payment of dividends and as to the distribution of assets upon dissolution, liquidation or the winding‑up of our affairs;
•
equal in priority with all other series of Preferred Stock we may issue in the future as to priority of payment of dividends and as to distributions of assets upon dissolution, liquidation or the winding‑up of our affairs; and
•
effectively subordinated to our existing and future indebtedness, including the Notes and borrowings under the Credit Facility.
Share Repurchase Program
General
Subject to certain restrictions and procedures, commencing on the date of original issuance (or, if after the date of original issuance our Board of Directors suspends the share repurchase program of the Series A Preferred Stock, on the date our Board of Directors reinstates such program) and terminating on the earlier to occur of (1) the date upon which our Board of Directors, by resolution, suspends or terminates the share repurchase program, and (2) the date on which shares of the Series A Preferred Stock are listed on a national securities exchange, holders of the Series A Preferred Stock may, at their option, require us to repurchase any or all of their shares of Series A Preferred Stock for a cash payment.
Quarterly Repurchase Limit
Repurchases made under the Share Repurchase Program will be subject to a quarterly repurchase limit of 5% of our then outstanding Series A Preferred Stock (by number of shares outstanding), calculated as of the end of the previous calendar quarter.
Applicable Repurchase Discounts
As a general matter, Shares repurchased under the Share Repurchase Program will be made at the liquidation preference of the Series A Preferred Stock (“Liquidation Preference”), or $25.00 per share. plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends to, but excluding, the “Stockholder Repurchase Date”, which is the tenth calendar day following delivery of such holder’s request that we repurchase shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, or if such tenth calendar day is not a business day, on the next succeeding business day; provided however, the share repurchase amount will be subject to the limitations set forth below:
(1.)
Shares that have not been outstanding for at least one year will be subject to an early repurchase discount of 10% (or at a price of $22.50 per Share);
(2.)
Shares that have been outstanding for at least one year but not more than two years will be subject to an early repurchase discount of 6% (or at a price of $23.50 per Share); and
(3.)
Shares that have been outstanding for at least two years but not more than three years will be subject to an early repurchase discount of 3% (or at a price of $24.25 per Share).
Additional Limitations
Our obligation to repurchase the Shares is limited to the extent that our Board of Directors determines, in its sole and absolute discretion, that it does not have sufficient funds available, it is restricted by applicable law from making such repurchases, or otherwise suspends or terminates the Share Repurchase Program in its sole and absolute discretion. In the event that our Board of Directors elects to terminate the Share Repurchase Program and subject to satisfaction of any applicable listing requirements, we intend to apply to list the Shares on Nasdaq or another national securities exchange within one calendar year of the termination, however, there can be no assurance that a listing will be achieved in such timeframe, or at all.
Repurchase Upon Death
Subject to certain conditions, including the limitations described above, commencing on the date of original issuance, Shares held by a natural person upon his or her death may be repurchased at the written request of the holder’s estate for a cash payment equal to the Liquidation Preference, or $25.00 per share, plus an amount equal to accrued and unpaid dividends to, but excluding, the “Death Repurchase Date”, which is the fifteenth calendar day of such estate’s request that we repurchase the Shares, or, if such fifteenth calendar day is not a business day, on the next succeeding business day.
Redemption
Mandatory Redemption for Asset Coverage
If we fail to maintain “Asset Coverage” (as defined below) of at least the minimum amount required by Sections 18 and 61 of the 1940 Act (which is currently 150%) as of the time of declaration of dividends or other distributions on our common stock (other than dividends payable in shares of common stock), after deducting the amount of such dividend or other distribution, as of the time of purchase of the Company’s common stock or issuance of any senior security as defined in the 1940 Act, and such failure is not cured as of the close of business on the “Asset Coverage Cure Date” (which is defined as the close of business on the date that is 90 calendar days following the date of such failure), the Series A Preferred Stock may become subject to mandatory redemption.
“Asset Coverage” means asset coverage of a class of senior security which is a stock, as defined for purposes of Sections 18(h) and 61 of the 1940 Act as in effect on the date of the Articles Supplementary, determined on the basis of values calculated as of a time within 48 hours (not including Sundays or holidays) next preceding the time of such determination.
Optional Redemption by the Company
Except in certain limited circumstances, we cannot redeem the Series A Preferred Stock prior to the earlier of (1) first anniversary of the Termination Date and (2) January 1, 2027.
The “Termination Date” is the date that is the earlier of (1) December 31, 2026 (unless earlier terminated or extended by our Board of Directors) or (2) the date on which all 6,000,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock are sold.
On and after the earlier of (1) first anniversary of the Termination Date and (2) January 1, 2027, at our sole option upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days’ written notice, we may redeem shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time, for cash at a redemption price of $25.00 per share, plus an amount equal to all accumulated and unpaid dividends on such shares to, but excluding, the date fixed for redemption, without interest. Holders of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed must then surrender such Series A Preferred Stock at the place designated in the notice. Upon surrender of the Series A Preferred Stock, the holders will be entitled to the redemption price. If notice of redemption of any shares of Series A Preferred Stock has been given and if we have deposited the funds necessary for such redemption with the paying agent for the benefit of the holders of any of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed, then from and after the redemption date, dividends will cease to accumulate on those shares of Series A Preferred Stock, those shares of Series A Preferred Stock will no longer be deemed outstanding and all rights of the holders of such shares will terminate, except the right to receive the redemption price. If less than all of the outstanding Series A Preferred Stock is to be redeemed,
the Series A Preferred Stock to be redeemed will be selected (1) pro rata, (2) by lot or (3) by any other fair and equitable method that our Board of Directors may choose.
1940 Act Restrictions on Dividends and Repurchases
For so long as any shares of Preferred Stock are outstanding, we will not: (x) declare any dividend or other distribution (other than a dividend or distribution paid in our common stock) in respect of our common stock, (y) call for redemption, redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire for consideration any such common stock, or (z) pay any proceeds of the liquidation of the Company in respect of such common stock, unless, in each case, (A) immediately thereafter, we will be in compliance with the Asset Coverage limitations applicable to us under the 1940 Act (currently 150%) after deducting the amount of such dividend or distribution or redemption or purchasing price or liquidation proceeds, (B) all cumulative dividends and distributions of shares of all series of Preferred Stock, if any, ranking on parity with the Series A Preferred Stock due on or prior to the date of the applicable dividend, distribution, redemption, purchase or acquisition shall have been declared and paid (or shall have been declared and sufficient funds or deposit securities as permitted by the terms of such Preferred Stock for the payment thereof shall have been deposited irrevocably with the applicable paying agent) and (C) we have deposited deposit securities with the redemption and paying agent in accordance with certain requirements with respect to outstanding Preferred Stock of any series to be redeemed pursuant an Asset Coverage mandatory redemption resulting from the failure to comply with the Asset Coverage for which a notice of redemption shall have been given or shall have been required to be given on or prior to the date of the applicable dividend, distribution, redemption, purchase or acquisition.
Liquidation Rights
In the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to be paid, out of our assets legally available for distribution to our stockholders, a liquidation distribution equal to the Liquidation Preference, plus an amount equal to any accumulated and unpaid dividends on such shares to, but excluding, the date of payment, but without interest, before any distribution of assets is made to holders of our common stock. If our assets legally available for distribution to stockholders are insufficient to pay in full the Liquidation Preference plus an amount equal to any accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock and the amounts due upon liquidation with respect to such other shares of Preferred Stock, then the available assets will be distributed among the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock and such other series of Preferred Stock ratably so that the amount of assets distributed per share of Series A Preferred Stock and such other series of Preferred Stock will in all cases bear to each other the same ratio that the Liquidation Preference per share on the Series A Preferred Stock and the liquidation preference on such other series of Preferred Stock bear to each other. Written notice of any such liquidation, dissolution or winding up of us, stating the payment date or dates when, and the place or places where, the amounts distributable in such circumstances will be payable, will be given by first class mail, postage pre‑paid, not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the payment date stated therein, to each record holder of the Series A Preferred Stock at the respective addresses of such holders as the same appear on the stock transfer records of the Company. After payment of the full amount of the liquidation preference, plus an amount equal to any accumulated and unpaid dividends to which they are entitled, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock will have no right or claim to any of our remaining assets. If we convert into or consolidate or merge with or into any other corporation, trust or entity, effect a statutory share exchange or sell, lease, transfer or convey all or substantially all of our property or business, we will not be deemed to have liquidated, dissolved or wound up.
Voting Rights
Except as otherwise provided in our charter, including the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock, each holder of a share of Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to one vote for each share of Series A Preferred Stock held by such holder on each matter submitted to a vote of our stockholders and the holders of outstanding shares of any Preferred Stock, including the Series A Preferred Stock, will vote together with holders of common stock as a single class. Under applicable rules of Nasdaq and Maryland law, we are currently required to hold annual meetings of stockholders.
In addition, the holders of outstanding shares of any Preferred Stock, including the Series A Preferred Stock, will be entitled, as a class, to the exclusion of the holders of all other securities and the common stock, to
elect two of our directors at all times (regardless of the total number of directors serving on the Board of Directors). We refer to these directors as the “Preferred Directors”. The holders of outstanding shares of common stock and Preferred Stock, including Series A Preferred Stock, voting together as a single class, will elect the balance of our directors. Under our bylaws, our directors are divided into three classes. At each annual meeting of our stockholders, the successors to the class of directors whose term expires at such meeting will be elected to hold office for a term expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders held in the third year following the year of their election. Our Preferred Directors will be up for election in 2026.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if: (1) at the close of business on any dividend payment date for dividends on any outstanding share of any Preferred Stock, including any outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, accumulated dividends (whether or not earned or declared) on the shares of Preferred Stock, including the Series A Preferred Stock, equal to at least two full years’ dividends shall be due and unpaid and sufficient cash or specified securities shall not have been deposited with the redemption and paying agent or other applicable paying agent for the payment of such accumulated dividends; or (2) at any time holders of any shares of Preferred Stock are entitled under the 1940 Act to elect a majority of our directors (a period when either of the foregoing conditions exists, a “Voting Period”), then the number of members constituting our Board of Directors will automatically be increased by the smallest number that, when added to the two directors elected exclusively by the holders of shares of any Preferred Stock, including the Series A Preferred Stock, as described above, would constitute a majority of our Board of Directors as so increased by such smallest number; and the holders of the shares of Preferred Stock, including the Series A Preferred Stock, will be entitled as a class on a one‑vote‑per‑share basis, to elect such additional directors. The terms of office of the individuals who are directors at the time of that election will not be affected by the election of the additional directors. If we thereafter shall pay, or declare and set apart for payment, in full all dividends payable on all outstanding shares of Preferred Stock, including Series A Preferred Stock, for all past dividend periods, or the Voting Period is otherwise terminated, (1) the voting rights stated above shall cease, subject always, however, to the revesting of such voting rights in the holders of shares of Preferred Stock upon the further occurrence of any of the events described herein, and (2) the terms of office of all of the additional directors so elected will terminate automatically. Any Preferred Stock, including Series A Preferred Stock, issued after the date hereof will vote with Series A Preferred Stock as a single class on the matters described above, and the issuance of any other Preferred Stock, including Series A Preferred Stock, by us may reduce the voting power of the holders of Series A Preferred Stock.
As soon as practicable after the accrual of any right of the holders of shares of Preferred Stock to elect additional directors as described above, we will call a special meeting of such holders and notify the Redemption and Paying Agent and/or such other person as is specified in the terms of such Preferred Stock to receive notice, (i) by mailing or delivery by electronic means or (ii) in such other manner and by such other means as are specified in the terms of such Preferred Stock, a notice of such special meeting to such holders, such meeting to be held not less than 10 nor more than 30 calendar days after the date of the delivery by electronic means or mailing of such notice. If we fail to call such a special meeting, it may be called at our expense by any such holder on like notice. The record date for determining the holders of shares of Preferred Stock entitled to notice of and to vote at such special meeting shall be the close of business on the fifth business day preceding the calendar day on which such notice is mailed. At any such special meeting and at each meeting of holders of shares of Preferred Stock held during a Voting Period at which directors are to be elected, such holders, voting together as a class (to the exclusion of the holders of all our other securities and classes of capital stock), will be entitled to elect the number of additional directors prescribed above on a one‑vote‑per‑share basis.
Except as otherwise permitted by the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock, so long as any shares of Series A Preferred Stock are outstanding, we will not, without the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least two‑thirds of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, voting as a separate class, amend, alter or repeal the provisions of the charter, including the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock, whether by merger, consolidation or otherwise, so as to materially and adversely affect any privilege, preference, right or power of the Series A Preferred Stock; provided, however, that (i) a change in our capitalization as described under the heading “—
Issuance of Additional Preferred Stock
” will not be considered to materially and adversely affect the privileges, preferences, rights or powers of Series A Preferred Stock, and (ii) a division of a share of Series A Preferred Stock will be deemed to affect such preferences, rights or powers only if the terms of such division materially and adversely affect the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock. For purposes of the foregoing, no matter shall be deemed to adversely affect any privilege, preference, right or power of a share of Series A Preferred Stock or the holder thereof unless such matter (i) alters or abolishes any preferential right of such share of Series A Preferred Stock, or (ii) creates,
alters or abolishes any right in respect of redemption of such Series A Preferred Stock (other than as a result of a division of such Series A Preferred Stock).
So long as any shares of Preferred Stock are outstanding, we will not, without the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least 66
2 / 3
% of the shares of Preferred Stock outstanding at the time, voting as a separate class, file a voluntary application for relief under federal bankruptcy law or any similar application under state law for so long as we are solvent and do not foresee becoming insolvent. No amendment, alteration or repeal of our obligation to redeem the Series A Preferred Stock or to accumulate dividends at the Dividend Rate will be effected without, in each case, the prior unanimous vote or consent of the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock.
The affirmative vote of the holders of at least a “majority of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock,” including the shares of Series A Preferred Stock outstanding at the time, voting as a separate class, will be required (i) to approve us ceasing to be, or to withdraw our election as, a BDC, or (ii) to approve any plan of “reorganization” (as such term is defined in Section 2(a)(33) of the 1940 Act) adversely affecting such shares of Preferred Stock.
For purposes of the foregoing, the vote of a “majority of the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock” means the vote at an annual or special meeting duly called of (a) 67% or more of such shares present at a meeting, if the holders of more than 50% of such outstanding shares are present or represented by proxy at such meeting, or (b) more than 50% of such outstanding shares, whichever is less.
For purposes of determining any rights of the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock to vote on any matter, whether such right is created by our charter, including the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock, by statute or otherwise, no holder of Series A Preferred Stock will be entitled to vote any shares of Series A Preferred Stock and no share of Series A Preferred Stock will be deemed to be “outstanding” for the purpose of voting or determining the number of shares required to constitute a quorum if, prior to or concurrently with the time of determination of shares entitled to vote or the time of the actual vote on the matter, as the case may be, the requisite Notice of Redemption with respect to such shares of Series A Preferred Stock will have been given in accordance with the terms of the Series A Preferred Stock, and the Redemption Price for the redemption of such shares of Series A Preferred Stock will have been irrevocably deposited with the Redemption and Paying Agent for that purpose. No shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by us will have any voting rights or be deemed to be outstanding for voting or for calculating the voting percentage required on any other matter or other purposes.
Unless otherwise required by law or our charter, holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock will not have any relative rights or preferences or other special rights with respect to voting other than those specifically set forth in the “
Voting Rights
” section of the Articles Supplementary. The holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock will have no rights to cumulative voting. In the event that we fail to declare or pay any dividends on Series A Preferred Stock, the exclusive remedy of the holders will be the right to vote for additional directors as discussed above.
Issuance of Additional Preferred Stock
So long as any shares of Series A Preferred Stock are outstanding, we may, without the vote or consent of the holders thereof, authorize, establish and create and issue and sell shares of one or more series of a class of our senior securities representing stock under Sections 18 and 61 of the 1940 Act, ranking on parity with the Series A Preferred Stock as to the payment of dividends and distribution of assets upon dissolution, liquidation or the winding up of our affairs, in addition to then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock, including additional series of Preferred Stock, and authorize, issue and sell additional shares of any such series of Preferred Stock then outstanding or so established and created, including additional shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, in each case in accordance with applicable law, provided that we will, immediately after giving effect to the issuance of such additional Preferred Stock and to our receipt and application of the proceeds thereof, including to the redemption of Preferred Stock with such proceeds, have Asset Coverage as required by Sections 18 and 61 of the 1940 Act (which is currently 150%).
Modification
The Board of Directors, without the vote of the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock, may interpret or correct the provisions of the Articles Supplementary to supply any omission, resolve any inconsistency or ambiguity or to cure or correct any defective or inconsistent provision, including any provision that becomes
defective after the date hereof because of impossibility of performance or any provision that is inconsistent with any provision of any other Preferred Stock or the common stock.
(b)
Provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws that may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control
Classified Board of Directors
In accordance with our bylaws, our Board of Directors is divided into three classes of directors serving staggered three-year terms, with the term of directors in each class expiring at the annual meeting of stockholders held in the third year following the year of their election. One class has three directors and two classes have two directors. A classified board may render more difficult a change in control of us or removal of our incumbent management. We believe, however, that the longer time required to elect a majority of a classified board of directors will help to ensure continuity and stability of our management and policies.
Our classified board could have the effect of making the replacement of incumbent directors more time consuming and difficult. Because our directors may only be removed for cause, at least two annual meetings of stockholders, instead of one, will generally be required to effect a change in a majority of our Board of Directors. Thus, our classified board could increase the likelihood that incumbent directors will retain their positions. The staggered terms of directors may delay, defer or prevent a tender offer or an attempt to change control of us or another transaction that might involve a premium price for our common stock that might be in the best interest of our stockholders.
Number of Directors; Removal; Vacancies
Our charter provides that the number of directors will be determined pursuant to our bylaws and our bylaws provide that a majority of our entire Board of Directors may at any time increase or decrease the number of directors. In addition, our bylaws provide that the number of directors shall not be increased by 50% or more in any 12-month period without the approval of two-thirds of the members of our Board of Directors then in office. Our bylaws provide that any vacancies may be filled only by the vote of a majority of the remaining directors, even if less than a quorum, and the directors so appointed shall hold office for the remainder of the full term of the class of directors in which the vacancy occurred and until their successors are elected and qualified.
Our directors may only be removed for cause and only by the affirmative vote of at least a majority of all the votes entitled to be cast by our stockholders generally in the election of directors. This provision, when coupled with the power of our Board of Directors to fill vacancies on our Board of Directors, precludes stockholders from removing incumbent directors except for cause and upon a substantial affirmative vote and could preclude stockholders from filling the vacancies created by such removal with their own nominees.
Advance Notice Provisions for Stockholder Nominations and Stockholder Proposals
Our bylaws establish an advance notice procedure for stockholders to make nominations of candidates for election as directors or to bring other business before an annual or special meeting of our stockholders, which we refer to as the stockholder notice procedure.
The stockholder notice procedure provides that with respect to an annual meeting of stockholders, nominations of individuals for election to our Board of Directors and the proposal of business to be considered by our stockholders at an annual meeting may be made only (1) pursuant to our notice of the meeting, (2) by or at the direction of our Board of Directors or (3) by a stockholder who was a stockholder of record at the time of giving of notice, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who has complied with the advance notice procedures set forth in our bylaws, including a requirement to provide certain information about the stockholder and the nominee or business proposal, as applicable. With respect to special meetings of stockholders, only the business specified in our notice of meeting may be brought before the meeting. Nominations of individuals for election to our Board of Directors may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected only (1) by or at the direction of our Board of Directors or (2) by a stockholder who was a stockholder of record at the time of giving of notice, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who has complied with the advance notice provisions set forth in our bylaws, including a requirement to provide certain information about the stockholder and the nominee.
The purpose of requiring stockholders to give us advance notice of nominations and other business is to afford our Board of Directors a meaningful opportunity to consider the qualifications of the proposed nominees and the advisability of the other proposed business and, to the extent deemed necessary or desirable by the Board of Directors, to inform stockholders and make recommendations about such qualifications or business, as well as to provide a more orderly procedure for conducting meetings of stockholders. Although our bylaws do not give our Board of Directors any power to disapprove stockholder nominations for the election of directors or proposals for action, they may have the effect of precluding a contest for the election of directors or the consideration of stockholder proposals if proper procedures are not followed and of discouraging or deterring a third party from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect its own slate of directors or to approve its own proposal without regard to whether consideration of such nominees or proposals might be harmful or beneficial to us and our stockholders.
Authority to Issue Preferred Stock without Stockholder Approval
As of September 30, 2024, our charter permits our Board of Directors to issue up to 50,000,000 shares of capital stock. Our Board of Directors may classify or reclassify any unissued common stock or preferred stock into other classes or series of stock and establish the preferences, conversion or other rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to distributions, qualifications and terms or conditions of redemption of any such stock. Thus, our Board of Directors could authorize the issuance of preferred stock with terms and conditions that could have a priority as to distributions and amounts payable upon liquidation over the rights of the holders of our common stock.
Amendment of Charter and Bylaws
Our charter may be amended, altered, changed or repealed, subject to the terms of any class or series of preferred stock, only if advised by our Board of Directors and approved by our stockholders by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of all the votes entitled to be cast on the matter.
Our charter also provides that the bylaws may be adopted, amended, altered, changed or repealed by our Board of Directors. Any action taken by our stockholders with respect to adopting, amending, altering, changing or repealing our bylaws may be taken only by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 75% of our capital stock, voting together as a single class.
These provisions are intended to make it more difficult for stockholders to circumvent certain other provisions contained in our charter and bylaws, such as those that provide for the classification of our Board of Directors. These provisions, however, also will make it more difficult for stockholders to amend the charter or bylaws without the approval of the Board of Directors, even if a majority of the stockholders deems such amendment to be in the best interests of all stockholders.
Indemnification and Limitation of Liability of Directors and Officers
Maryland law permits a Maryland corporation to include in its charter a provision limiting the liability of its directors and officers to the corporation and its stockholders for money damages, except for liability resulting from (a) actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money, property or services or (b) active and deliberate dishonesty that is established by a final judgment and is material to the cause of action. Our charter contains a provision that eliminates the liability of our directors and officers to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law.
The Maryland General Corporation Law (the “MGCL”) requires us (unless our charter provides otherwise, which our charter does not) to indemnify a director or officer who has been successful, on the merits or otherwise, in the defense of any proceeding to which he or she is made a party by reason of his or her service in that capacity. The MGCL permits us to indemnify our present and former directors and officers, among others, against judgments, penalties, fines, settlements and reasonable expenses actually incurred by them in connection with any proceeding to which they may be made or threatened to be made a party by reason of their service in those or other capacities unless it is established that:
•
the act or omission of the director or officer was material to the matter giving rise to the proceeding and (1) was committed in bad faith or (2) was the result of active and deliberate dishonesty;
•
the director or officer actually received an improper personal benefit in money, property or services; or
•
in the case of any criminal proceeding, the director or officer had reasonable cause to believe that the act or omission was unlawful.
Under the MGCL, we may not indemnify a director or officer in a suit by us or on our behalf in which the director or officer was adjudged liable to us or in a suit in which the director or officer was adjudged liable on the basis that personal benefit was improperly received. A court may order indemnification if it determines that the director or officer is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnification, even though the director or officer did not meet the prescribed standard of conduct or was adjudged liable on the basis that personal benefit was improperly received. However, indemnification for an adverse judgment in a suit by us or on our behalf, or for a judgment of liability on the basis that personal benefit was improperly received, is limited to expenses.
In addition, the MGCL permits us to advance reasonable expenses to a director or officer upon our receipt of:
•
a written affirmation by the director or officer of his or her good faith belief that he or she has met the standard of conduct necessary for indemnification by us; and
•
a written undertaking by or on behalf of the director or officer to repay the amount paid or reimbursed by us if it is ultimately determined that the director or officer did not meet the standard of conduct.
Our bylaws permit us to advance expenses so long as, in addition to the requirements above, we obtain security for the advance from the director or officer, we obtain insurance against losses arising by reason of lawful advances or we determine that there is reason to believe that the director or officer will be found entitled to indemnification.
Subject to the 1940 Act, or any valid rule, regulation or order of the SEC thereunder, our charter obligates us, to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law in effect from time to time, to indemnify and pay or reimburse reasonable expenses in advance of final disposition of a proceeding to any director or officer, whether serving our company or at our request any other entity. Our charter also permits us to indemnify and advance expenses to any employee or agent of our company to the extent authorized by our Board of Directors or the bylaws and permitted by law.
Our bylaws obligate us, to the maximum extent required by Maryland law or the charter, to indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, by reason of the fact that he is or was our director, officer, employee or agent, or is or was serving at our request as a director, officer, manager, partner, trustee, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise if our Board of Directors determines that such person acted in good faith and in a manner reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of our company, and, in the case of any criminal action or proceeding, that such person had no reasonable cause to believe that such person’s conduct was unlawful. However, our bylaws permit us to advance expenses only so long as, in addition to the requirements above, we obtain security for the advance from the director or officer, we obtain insurance against losses arising by reason of lawful advances or we determine that there is reason to believe that the director or officer will be found entitled to indemnification.
These provisions on indemnification and limitation of liability are subject to the limitations of the 1940 Act that prohibit us from protecting any director or officer against any liability to us or our stockholders arising from willful misfeasance, bad faith, gross negligence or reckless disregard of the duties involved in the conduct of such person’s office.
