Participant
”)
Address:
Participant has been granted an award of Restricted Stock Units (the “
Award
”) subject to the terms and conditions of this Stand-Alone Restricted Stock Unit Agreement, which includes this Notice of Restricted Stock Unit Grant (the “
Notice of Grant
”), the Terms and Conditions of Restricted Stock Unit Grant attached hereto as Exhibit A, and all other exhibits, appendices and addenda attached hereto (the “
Award Agreement
”).
Grant Number:	______________________________
Date of Grant:	______________________________
Vesting Commencement Date:	______________________________
Total Number of Restricted Stock Units:	______________________________
Event Deadline Date:	______________________________
Stockholder Approval
:
The Company intends to submit this Award to the Company’s stockholders for their approval at the next annual meeting of the stockholders of the Company, which is expected to occur in or around June of 2026 (the “
Annual Meeting
”) or at an earlier special meeting of stockholders called for the purpose of approving this Award. In the event that the stockholders of the Company do not approve this Award by the date of such Annual Meeting or the last adjournment thereof, the Award shall be null and void, and of no further effect, and Participant will have no further rights under the Award Agreement. In no event will any portion of this Award vest prior to stockholder approval of this Award. To the extent that any vesting condition with respect to this Award otherwise would be satisfied pursuant to the Vesting Schedule prior to the date of any such stockholder approval, the applicable vesting date for the portion of the Award will not occur before, and will be delayed until, the date of such stockholder approval.
Vesting Schedule
:
Subject to any acceleration provisions contained in this Award Agreement, or any other written agreement authorized by the Administrator between Participant and the Company (or any Parent or Subsidiary of the Company, as applicable) governing the terms of this Award entered into after the Date of Grant, the Restricted Stock Units will be scheduled to vest according to the following vesting schedule:
As detailed in the table below, the Restricted Stock Units are divided into ten (10) vesting tranches (each a “
Tranche
”), with each Tranche representing one tenth (1/10
th
) of the Total Number of Restricted Stock Units. The vesting of each Tranche is conditioned on the satisfaction of both the Service Requirement and attainment of the Tranche’s designated Stock Price Goal, and applies only to Restricted Stock Units that become Eligible RSUs, in each case as described below.
Vesting Tranche
Stock Price Threshold *
1
$20.00

$25.00

$50.00
8
$55.00
9
$60.00
10
$65.00
*	These Stock Price Threshold figures will be appropriately and proportionately adjusted by the Plan Administrator in the event of any Capitalization Adjustment.
The “
Stock Price Goal
” for a Tranche is achieved if the closing price per share of the Company’s Common Stock equals or exceeds the Stock Price Threshold set forth in the table above (taking into account any adjustment by the Plan Administrator in response to any Capitalization Adjustment) for each of a series of sixty (60) consecutive trading days that ends on or prior to the Event Deadline Date.
If the Stock Price Goal for a Tranche is achieved, the number of Restricted Stock Units eligible for vesting under that Tranche for a given vesting date (before application of the percentage of such Restricted Stock Units available for vesting on that date pursuant to the table below) will be equal to the product of (i) the total number of Restricted Stock Units allocated to that Tranche, mulitiplied by (ii) the VWAP Growth Factor for such vesting date (such Restricted Stock Units, the “
Eligible RSUs
”). For this purpose the “
VWAP Growth Factor
” for a vesting date equals the quotient of (x) the difference of (A) the 20-day VWAP for such vesting date, reduced (but not below zero) by (B) the 20-day VWAP as of the Vesting Commencement Date, divided by (y) the 20-day VWAP as of the Vesting Commencement Date. For this purpose, the “20-day VWAP” represents the volume-weighted average closing price per share of the Company’s Common Stock, measured with respect to a given date over the consecutive, trailing 20 trading days ending on and including such date.
Participant will have no right with respect to any Restricted Stock Units allocated to a Tranche for which the Stock Price Goal is not achieved on or prior to the Event Deadline Date, or
-
2
-
any Restricted Stock Units that do not become Eligible RSUs (regardless of the extent to which the Service-Based Requirement is satisfied).
If the Stock Price Goal for a Tranche is achieved:, the Service Requirement will be satisfied as to a portion of the Eligible RSUs for that Tranche on the first date on which that Stock Price Goal is achieved (the “
Stock Price Achievement Date
”), and as to an additional portion of the Eligible RSUs for that Tranche on the designated anniversaries of the Stock Price Achievement Date, in each case as set forth in the table below, subject in each case to Participant remaining an Employee through the Stock Price Achievement Date and remaining a Service Provider through the applicable vesting date.

Qualifying Termination of Employment:
In the event that Participant becomes eligible for severance payments in connection with a termination of Participant’s employment pursuant to an offer letter or employment agreement by and between Participant and the Company (or by and among Participant, the Company and a Company subsidiary) (Participant’s “
Employment Agreement
”) due to a termination by the Company or an affiliate without Cause (within the meaning of the Employment Agreement) or Participant’s resignation for Good Reason (within the meaning of the Employment Agreement) outside of the Change in Control Period or similar period of heighted protection designated therein, then, notwithstanding the Service Requirement as described above, subject to Participant’s satisfaction of all conditions of receipt of such severance payments under the Employment Agreement, including Participant’s entry into and non-revocation of a Separation Agreement and Release of Claims and Participant’s compliance with the Employee Intellectual Property and Non-Compete Agreement previously executed by Participant, Participant will become vested in each Tranche for which the Stock Price Goal has been achieved prior to the date of such termination, with respect to any portion of such Tranche for which the vesting date has not occurred on or prior to such termination.

[Qualifying Termination of Board Service:
In the event that Participant ceases to be an Employee, but continues to be a Director following such cessation of employment, and Participant subsequently ceases to be a Director because Participant is not nominated by the Company for reelection to the Board (and not because Participant declines to stand for reelection), or the stockholders of the Company fail to reelect Participant to the Board, then, notwithstanding the Service Requirement as described above, subject to Participant’s satisfaction of all conditions of receipt of severance payments under the Employment Agreement applicable to a termination of employment by the Company without Cause, including Participant’s entry into and non-revocation of a Separation Agreement and Release of Claims and Participant’s compliance with the Employee Intellectual Property and Non-Compete Agreement previously executed by Participant, Participant will become vested in each Tranche for which the Stock Price Goal has been achieved, with respect to any portion of such Tranche for which the vesting date has not occurred on or prior to such cessation of service on the Board.]
Termination of Employment due to Death or Disability:
In the event that Participant’s employment terminates due to Participant’s death or due to a termination by the Company or an affiliate based on Participant’s Disability (within the meaning of the Employment Agreement), then, notwithstanding the Service Requirement as described above, subject to Participant’s satisfaction of all conditions of receipt of severance payments under such Employment Agreement applicable to a termination of employment by the Company without Cause, including Participant’s entry into and non-revocation of a Separation Agreement and Release of Claims (which may be executed by Participant’s representative, guardian or executor, as applicable, in the case of Participant’s incapacity or death) and Participant’s compliance with the Employee Intellectual Property and Non-Compete Agreement previously executed by Participant, Participant will become vested in each Tranche for which the Stock Price Goal has been achieved, with respect to any portion of such Tranche for which the vesting date has not occurred on or prior to such termination.
Change in Control:
In the event of a Change in Control that occurs before achievement of the Stock Price Goal for any Tranche, (i) achievement of such Stock Price Goal will be measured using the closing price of the Common Stock for the last trading day prior to the date of consummation of such Change in Control in lieu of measurement of the closing price over a consecutive sixty (60) trading day period that would otherwise apply, (ii) any such Tranche for which the Stock Price Goal is not achieved based on this measurement will be forfeited in full, and (iii) any Tranche for which the Stock Price Goal is so met will vest in full upon Participant’s continued service through the the date of consummation of such Change in Control.

RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT
TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT GRANT
Unless otherwise defined herein, defined terms shall have the meanings set forth in the Notice of Restricted Stock Unit Grant of this Award Agreement (the “
Notice of Grant
”) or in Section 30 below.
1.
Grant of Restricted Stock Units
. The Company hereby grants to the individual (“
Participant
”) named in the Notice of Grant an award of Restricted Stock Units subject to the terms and conditions of this Award Agreement.
2.
Company’s Obligation to Pay
. Each Restricted Stock Unit represents the right to receive a Share on the date it vests. Unless and until the Restricted Stock Units will have vested in the manner set forth in Section 3 or 4, Participant will have no right to payment of any such Restricted Stock Units. Prior to actual payment of any vested Restricted Stock Units, such Restricted Stock Unit will represent an unsecured obligation of the Company, payable (if at all) only from the general assets of the Company.
3.
Vesting Schedule
. Except as provided in Section 4 and subject to Sections 5 and 11, the Restricted Stock Units awarded by this Award Agreement will vest in accordance with the vesting provisions set forth in the Notice of Grant. Unless specifically provided otherwise in this Award Agreement or other written agreement authorized by the Administrator between Participant and the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary of the Company, as applicable, governing the terms of this Award, Restricted Stock Units scheduled to vest on a certain date or upon the occurrence of a certain condition will not vest in accordance with any of the provisions of this Award Agreement, unless Participant will have been continuously a Service Provider from the Date of Grant until the date such vesting occurs.
4.
Payment after Vesting
.
(a)
General Rule
. Subject to Section [7], any Restricted Stock Units that vest will be paid to Participant (or in the event of Participant’s death, to his or her properly designated beneficiary or estate) in whole Shares. Subject to the provisions of Section 4(c), such vested Restricted Stock Units shall be paid in whole Shares as soon as practicable after vesting, but in each such case
within sixty (60) days following the vesting date. In no event will Participant be permitted, directly or indirectly, to specify the taxable year of payment of any Restricted Stock Units payable under this Award Agreement.
(b)
Discretionary Acceleration
. The Administrator, in its discretion, may accelerate the vesting of the balance, or some lesser portion of the balance, of the unvested Restricted Stock Units at any time, subject to the terms of this Award Agreement. If so accelerated, such Restricted Stock Units will be considered as having vested as of the date specified by the Administrator.
(c)
Section 409A
.
(i)
If Participant is a U.S. taxpayer, the payment of Shares vesting pursuant to this Award Agreement (including any discretionary acceleration under Section 4(b)) shall in all cases be paid at a time or in a manner that is exempt from, or complies with, Section 409A. The prior sentence may be superseded in a future agreement or amendment to this Award Agreement only by direct and specific reference to such sentence.
(ii)
Notwithstanding anything in the Plan or this Award Agreement or any other agreement (whether entered into before, on or after the Date of Grant), if the vesting of the balance, or some lesser portion of the balance, of the Restricted Stock Units is accelerated in connection with the termination of Participant’s status as a Service Provider (provided that such termination is a “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A, as determined by the Administrator), other than due to Participant’s death, and if (x) Participant is a U.S. taxpayer and a “specified employee” within the meaning of Section 409A at the time of such termination as a Service Provider and (y) the payment of such accelerated Restricted Stock Units will result in the imposition of additional tax under Section 409A if paid to Participant on or within the six (6) month period following the cessation of Participant’s status as a Service Provider, then the payment of such accelerated Restricted Stock Units will not be made until the date six (6) months and one (1) day following the date of cessation of Participant’s status as a Service Provider, unless Participant dies following his or her termination as a Service Provider, in which case, the Restricted Stock Units will be paid in Shares to Participant’s estate as soon as practicable following his or her death.
(iii)
It is the intent of this Award Agreement that it and all payments and benefits to U.S. taxpayers hereunder be exempt from, or comply with, the requirements of Section 409A so that none of the Restricted Stock Units provided under this Award Agreement or Shares issuable thereunder will be subject to the additional tax imposed under Section 409A, and any ambiguities or ambiguous terms herein will be interpreted to be so exempt or so comply. Each payment payable under this Award Agreement is intended to constitute a separate payment for purposes of Treasury Regulations Section 1.409A-2(b)(2). To the extent necessary to comply with Section 409A, references to termination of Participant’s status as a Service Provider, termination of employment, or similar phrases will be references to Participant’s “separation from service” within the meaning of Section 409A. In no event will the Company or any Parent or Subsidiary of the Company have any responsibility, liability, or obligation to reimburse, indemnify, or hold harmless Participant (or any other person) for any taxes, penalties and interest that may be imposed, or other costs that may be incurred, as a result of Section 409A.
5.
Forfeiture Upon Termination as a Service Provider
. Unless specifically provided otherwise in this Award Agreement or other written agreement authorized by the Administrator between Participant and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parents, as applicable, governing the terms of this Award, if Participant ceases to be a Service Provider for any or no reason, the then-unvested Restricted Stock Units awarded by this Award Agreement will thereupon be forfeited at no cost to the Company and Participant will have no further rights thereunder.
6.

. Any distribution or delivery to be made to Participant under this Award Agreement, if Participant is then deceased, will be made to Participant’s designated beneficiary, or if no beneficiary survives Participant, the administrator or executor of Participant’s
-
2
-
estate. Any such transferee must furnish the Company with (a) written notice of his or her status as transferee, and (b) evidence satisfactory to the Company to establish the validity of the transfer and compliance with any laws or regulations pertaining to said transfer.
7.
Tax Obligations
(a)
Responsibility for Taxes
. Participant acknowledges that, regardless of any action taken by the Company or, if different, Participant’s employer or any Parent or Subsidiary of the Company to which Participant is providing services (together, the “
Service Recipients
”), the ultimate liability for any tax and/or social insurance liability obligations and requirements in connection with the Restricted Stock Units, including, without limitation, (i) all federal, state, and local taxes (including Participant’s Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) obligations) that are required to be withheld by any Service Recipient or other payment of tax-related items related to the Award of Restricted Stock Unit and legally applicable to Participant, (ii) Participant’s and, to the extent required by any Service Recipient, the Service Recipient’s fringe benefit tax liability, if any, associated with the grant, vesting, or settlement of the Restricted Stock Units, or the sale of Shares, and (iii) any other Service Recipient taxes the responsibility for which Participant has, or has agreed to bear, with respect to the Restricted Stock Units (or settlement thereof or issuance of Shares thereunder) (collectively, the “
Tax Obligations
”), is and remains Participant’s sole responsibility and may exceed the amount actually withheld by the applicable Service Recipient(s). Participant further acknowledges that no Service Recipient (A) makes any representations or undertakings regarding the treatment of any Tax Obligations in connection with any aspect of the Restricted Stock Units, including, but not limited to, the grant, vesting or settlement of the Restricted Stock Units, the subsequent sale of Shares acquired pursuant to such settlement and the receipt of any dividends or other distributions, and (B) makes any commitment to and is under any obligation to structure the terms of the grant or any aspect of the Restricted Stock Units to reduce or eliminate Participant’s liability for Tax Obligations or achieve any particular tax result. Further, if Participant is subject to Tax Obligations in more than one jurisdiction between the Date of Grant and the date of any relevant taxable or tax withholding event, as applicable, Participant acknowledges that the applicable Service Recipient(s) (or former employer, as applicable) may be required to withhold or account for Withholding Obligations (as defined below) in more than one jurisdiction. If Participant fails to make satisfactory arrangements for the payment of any required Withholding Obligations hereunder at the time of the applicable taxable event, Participant acknowledges and agrees that the Company may refuse to issue or deliver the Shares.
(b)
Tax Withholding
. Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Award Agreement, no certificate representing the Shares to be settled hereunder may be issued, unless and until satisfactory arrangements (as determined by the Administrator) will have been made by Participant with respect to the payment of all Tax Obligations required to be withheld (the “
Withholding Obligations
”). When Restricted Stock Units are vested and settled, Participant generally will recognize immediate U.S. taxable income if Participant is a U.S. taxpayer. If Participant is a non-U.S. taxpayer, Participant will be subject to applicable taxes in his or her jurisdiction. Pursuant to such procedures as the Administrator may specify from time to time, the applicable Service Recipient(s) will withhold the amount required to be withheld for the payment of Withholding Obligations. The Administrator, in its sole discretion and pursuant to such procedures as it may specify from time to time, may permit Participant to satisfy such Withholding Obligations, in whole or in part (without limitation), if permissible by applicable local law, by: (i) paying cash in U.S. dollars, (ii) having the Company withhold otherwise deliverable Shares having a fair market value equal to the
-
3
-
minimum amount that is necessary to meet the withholding requirement for such Withholding Obligations (or such greater amount as Participant may elect if permitted by the Administrator, if such greater amount would not result in adverse financial accounting consequences) (“
Net Share Withholding
”), (iii) withholding the amount of such Withholding Obligations from Participant’s wages or other cash compensation paid to Participant by the applicable Service Recipient(s), (iv) delivering to the Company Shares that Participant owns and that already have vested with a fair market value equal to the Withholding Obligations (or such greater amount as Participant may elect if permitted by the Administrator, if such greater amount would not result in adverse financial accounting consequences), (v) selling a sufficient number of such Shares otherwise deliverable to Participant, through such means as the Company may determine in its sole discretion (whether through a broker or otherwise) equal to the minimum amount that is necessary to meet the withholding requirement for such Withholding Obligations (or such greater amount as Participant may elect if permitted by the Administrator, if such greater amount would not result in adverse financial accounting consequences) (“
Sell to Cover
”), or (vi) such other means as the Administrator deems appropriate. If the Withholding Obligations are satisfied by withholding in Shares, for tax purposes, Participant is deemed to have been issued the full number of Shares subject to the vested Restricted Stock Units, notwithstanding that a number of the Shares are held back solely for the purpose of paying the Withholding Obligations. To the extent determined appropriate by the Administrator in its discretion, the Administrator will have the right (but not the obligation) to satisfy any Withholding Obligations by Net Share Withholding. If Net Share Withholding is the method by which such Withholding Obligations are satisfied, the Company will not withhold on a fractional Share basis to satisfy any portion of the Withholding Obligations and, unless the Company determines otherwise, no refund will be made to Participant for the value of the portion of a Share, if any, withheld in excess of the Withholding Obligations. If a Sell to Cover is the method by which Withholding Obligations are satisfied, Participant agrees that as part of the Sell to Cover, additional Shares may be sold to satisfy any associated broker or other fees. Only whole Shares will be sold pursuant to a Sell to Cover. Any proceeds from the sale of Shares pursuant to a Sell to Cover that are in excess of the Withholding Obligations and any associated broker or other fees will be paid to Participant in accordance with procedures the Company may specify from time to time.
(c)
Tax Consequences
. Participant has reviewed with his or her own tax advisers the U.S. federal, state, local and non-U.S. tax consequences of this investment and the transactions contemplated by this Award Agreement. With respect to such matters, Participant relies solely on such advisers and not on any statements or representations of the Company or any of its agents, written or oral. Participant understands that Participant (and not the Company) shall be responsible for Participant’s own tax liability that may arise as a result of this investment or the transactions contemplated by this Award Agreement.
(d)
Company’s Obligation to Deliver Shares
. For clarification purposes, in no event will the Company issue Participant any Shares unless and until arrangements satisfactory to the Administrator have been made for the payment of Participant’s Withholding Obligations. If Participant fails to make satisfactory arrangements for the payment of such Withholding Obligations hereunder at the time any applicable Restricted Stock Units otherwise are scheduled to vest pursuant to Sections 3 or 4, or Participant’s Withholding Obligations otherwise become due, Participant permanently will forfeit such Restricted Stock Units to which Participant’s Withholding Obligation relates and any right to receive Shares thereunder and such Restricted Stock Units will be returned to the Company at no cost to the Company. Participant acknowledges and agrees that the Company may
-
4
-
permanently refuse to issue or deliver the Shares if such Withholding Obligations are not delivered at the time they are due.
8.
Rights as Stockholder
. Neither Participant nor any person claiming under or through Participant will have any of the rights or privileges of a stockholder of the Company in respect of any Shares deliverable hereunder unless and until certificates representing such Shares (which may be in book entry form) will have been issued, recorded on the records of the Company or its transfer agents or registrars, and delivered to Participant (including through electronic delivery to a brokerage account). After such issuance, recordation and delivery, Participant will have all the rights of a stockholder of the Company with respect to voting such Shares and receipt of dividends and distributions on such Shares.
9.
Administration
. Subject to the provisions of this Award Agreement, the Administrator will have the authority, in its discretion: (i) to construe and interpret the terms of this Award Agreement; (ii) to prescribe, amend and rescind rules and regulations relating to the Award as the Administrator may deem necessary or advisable; (iii) to amend or terminate this Award Agreement (provided that no amendment or termination of the Award Agreement will materially impair the rights of Participant unless mutually agreed otherwise between the Participant and the Administrator, which agreement must be in writing and signed by the Participant and the Company); (iv) to allow Participant to satisfy withholding tax obligations with respect to the Award in a manner prescribed in Section 6; (v) to authorize any person to execute on behalf of the Company any instrument required to effect the grant of the Award; and (vi) to make all other determinations deemed necessary or advisable for administering the Award. The Administrator’s decisions, determinations and interpretations will be final and binding on Participant and any other holder of the Award and will be given the maximum deference permitted by Applicable Laws.
10.
Leaves of Absence/Transfer Between Locations
. Unless the Administrator provides otherwise or as otherwise required by Applicable Laws, vesting of the Award of Restricted Stock Units will be suspended during any unpaid leave of absence of Participant. Participant will not cease to be an Employee in the case of (a) any leave of absence approved by the Company or (b) transfers between locations of the Company or between the Company, its Parent, or any of its Subsidiaries.
11.
Adjustments; Dissolution or Liquidation; Merger or Change in Control
.
(a)
Adjustments
. In the event that any dividend or other distribution (whether in the form of cash, Shares, other securities, or other property), recapitalization, stock split, reverse stock split, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off, combination, reclassification, repurchase, or exchange of Shares or other securities of the Company, or other change in the corporate structure of the Company affecting the Shares occurs (other than any ordinary dividends or other ordinary distributions), the Administrator, in order to prevent diminution or enlargement of the benefits or potential benefits intended to be made available under this Award Agreement, will adjust the number and class of shares of stock that may be delivered under the Award Agreement.
(b)
Dissolution or Liquidation
. In the event of the proposed dissolution or liquidation of the Company, the Administrator will notify Participant as soon as practicable prior to the effective date of such proposed transaction. To the extent it has not been previously vested, the
-
5
-
Restricted Stock Award will terminate immediately prior to the consummation of such proposed action.
(c)
Merger or Change in Control
. Subject to any relevant provisions in the Notice of Grant, in the event of a merger of the Company with or into another corporation or other entity or a Change in Control, the Award will be treated as the Administrator determines (subject to the provisions of the following paragraph) without Participant’s consent, including, without limitation, that (i) the Award will be assumed, or a substantially equivalent award will be substituted, by the acquiring or succeeding corporation (or an affiliate thereof) with appropriate adjustments as to the number and kind of shares; (ii) upon written notice to Participant, that the Award of Restricted Stock Units will terminate upon or immediately prior to the consummation of such merger or Change in Control; (iii) restrictions applicable to the Award of Restricted Stock Units will lapse, in whole or in part prior to or upon consummation of such merger or Change in Control, and, to the extent the Administrator determines, terminate upon or immediately prior to the effectiveness of such merger or Change in Control; (iv) the termination of the Award of Restricted Stock Units in exchange for an amount of cash and/or property, if any, equal to the amount that would have been attained upon realization of the Participant’s rights under the Award of Restricted Stock Units as of the date of the occurrence of the transaction (and, for the avoidance of doubt, if as of the date of the occurrence of the transaction the Administrator determines in good faith that no amount would have been attained upon the realization of the Participant’s rights, then such Award may be terminated by the Company without payment). In taking any of the actions permitted under this Section 10(c), the Administrator will not be obligated to treat all awards, all awards held by Participant, all awards of the same type, or all portions of awards, similarly.
In the event that the successor corporation does not assume or substitute for the Award of Restricted Stock Units (or portion thereof) in such a merger or Change in Control, all restrictions on the Award of Restricted Stock Units (or portion thereof) not assumed or substituted for will lapse, in each case unless specifically provided otherwise under this Award Agreement or other written agreement authorized by the Administrator between Participant and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Parents, as applicable.
For the purposes of this Section 10(c), the Award of Restricted Stock Units will be considered assumed if, following the merger or Change in Control, the Award of Restricted Stock Units confers the right to purchase or receive, for each Share subject to the Award immediately prior to the merger or Change in Control, the consideration (whether stock, cash, or other securities or property) received in the merger or Change in Control by holders of Common Stock for each Share held on the effective date of the transaction (and if holders were offered a choice of consideration, the type of consideration chosen by the holders of a majority of the outstanding Shares).
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 10(c) to the contrary, and unless otherwise provided in this Award Agreement, if the Award of Restricted Stock Units is subject to Section 409A and if the change in control definition contained in the Award Agreement (or other agreement related to the Award, as applicable) does not comply with the definition of “change in control” for purposes of a distribution under Section 409A, then any payment of an amount that is otherwise accelerated under this Section will be delayed until the earliest time that such payment would be permissible under Section 409A without triggering any penalties applicable under Section 409A.

13.

Participant acknowledges and agrees that no Service Recipient shall be liable for any foreign exchange rate fluctuation between Participant’s local currency and the United States Dollar that may affect the value of the Restricted Stock Units or of any amounts due to Participant pursuant to the settlement of the Restricted Stock Units or the subsequent sale of any Shares acquired upon settlement; and
(iii)
no claim or entitlement to compensation or damages shall arise from forfeiture of the Restricted Stock Units resulting from the termination of Participant’s status as a Service Provider (for any reason whatsoever whether or not later found to be invalid or in breach of employment laws in the jurisdiction where Participant is a Service Provider or the terms of Participant’s employment or service agreement, if any), and in consideration of the grant of the Restricted Stock Units to which Participant is otherwise not entitled, Participant irrevocably agrees never to institute any claim against any Service Recipient, waives his or her ability, if any, to bring any such claim, and releases each Service Recipient from any such claim; if, notwithstanding the foregoing, any such claim is allowed by a court of competent jurisdiction, then, by participating in the Restricted Stock Unit Award, Participant shall be deemed irrevocably to have agreed not to pursue such claim and agrees to execute any and all documents necessary to request dismissal or withdrawal of such claim.

Participant understands that the Company and the Service Recipient may hold certain personal information about Participant, including, but not limited to, Participant’s name, home address and telephone number, date of birth, social insurance number or other identification number, salary, nationality, job title, any Shares or directorships held in the Company, details of all Restricted Stock Units or any other entitlement to Shares awarded, canceled, exercised, vested, unvested or outstanding in Participant’s favor (“Data”), for the exclusive purpose of implementing, administering and managing the Award of Restricted Stock Units.
Participant understands that Data may be transferred to a stock plan service provider, as may be selected by the Company in the future, assisting the Company with the implementation, administration and management of the Award of Restricted Stock Units. Participant understands that the recipients of the Data may be located in the United States or elsewhere, and that the recipients’ country of operation (e.g., the United States) may have different data privacy laws and protections than Participant’s country. Participant understands that if he or she resides outside the United States, he or she may request a list with the names and addresses of any potential recipients of the Data by contacting his or her local human resources representative.

The only adverse consequence of refusing or withdrawing Participant’s consent is that the Company would not be able to grant Participant Restricted Stock Units or other equity awards or administer or maintain such awards. Therefore, Participant understands that refusing or withdrawing his or her consent may affect Participant’s ability to participate in the Award of

APPENDIX A
PALLADYNE AI CORP.
COUNTRY ADDENDUM TO RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AGREEMENT
Unless otherwise defined herein, capitalized terms used in this Country Addendum to Restricted Stock Unit Agreement (the “
Country Addendum
”) will be ascribed the same defined meanings as set forth in the Restricted Stock Unit Agreement of which this Country Addendum forms a part (or other written agreement as specified in the Restricted Stock Unit Agreement).
Terms and Conditions
This Country Addendum includes additional terms and conditions that govern the Award of Restricted Stock Units granted to a Participant to the extent Participant resides and/or works in one of the countries listed below. If Participant is a citizen or resident (or is considered as such for local law purposes) of a country other than the country in which Participant is currently residing and/or working, or if Participant relocates to another country after the Award of Restricted Stock Units is granted, the Company, in its discretion, will determine to what extent the terms and conditions contained herein will apply to Participant.
Notifications
This Country Addendum also may include information regarding exchange controls and certain other issues of which Participant should be aware with respect to Participant’s participation in the Award of Restricted Stock Units. The information is based on the securities, exchange control and other Applicable Laws in effect in the respective countries as of [DATE]. Such Applicable Laws often are complex and change frequently. As a result, the Company strongly recommends that Participant not rely on the information in this Country Addendum as the only source of information relating to the consequences of Participant’s participation in the Award of Restricted Stock Units because the information may be out of date at the time Participant vests in or receives or sells the Shares covered by the Restricted Stock Units.
In addition, the information contained in this Country Addendum is general in nature and may not apply to Participant’s particular situation, and the Company is not in a position to assure Participant of any particular result. Participant should seek appropriate professional advice as to how the Applicable Laws in Participant’s country may apply to his or her situation.
Finally, if Participant is a citizen or resident of a country other than the one in which Participant currently is residing and/or working, transfers residence and/or employment to another country after the grant of the Restricted Stock Units, or is considered a resident of another country for local law purposes, the information in this Country Addendum may not apply to Participant in the same manner.
