“THE ISSUANCE AND SALE OF THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS. THE SECURITIES MAY NOT BE OFFERED FOR SALE, SOLD, TRANSFERRED OR ASSIGNED IN THE ABSENCE OF (A) AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR THE SECURITIES UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED, OR (B) AN OPINION OF COUNSEL ACCEPTABLE TO THE COMPANY THAT REGISTRATION IS NOT REQUIRED UNDER SAID ACT.”
(c)
Reservation of Shares Issuable Upon Conversion
. The Company shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its authorized but unissued Common Stock, solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of this Note such number of Conversion Shares as shall from time to time be sufficient to effect the conversion of the Note; and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of the entire outstanding Principal Amount of this Note, without limitation of such other remedies as shall be available to the Payee, the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of counsel, be necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes.
(d)
Fractional Shares
. No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of this Note. As to any fraction of a share that the Payee would otherwise be entitled to purchase upon such conversion, the Company shall, at its election, either pay a cash adjustment in respect of such final fraction in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by the Conversion Price or round up to the next whole share.

. The Maker hereby waives all notices in connection with the delivery, acceptance, performance, default, or enforcement of the payment of this Note, and agrees that its liability shall be unconditional, without regard to the liability of any other party, and shall not be affected in any manner by any indulgence, extension of time, renewal, waiver or modification granted or consented to by the Payee, and consents to any and all extensions of time, renewals, waivers, or modifications that may be granted by the Payee with respect to the payment or other provisions of this Note, and agrees that additional makers, endorsers, guarantors, or sureties may become parties hereto without notice to the Maker or affecting the Maker’s liability hereunder.

Upon receiving such written notice and reasonably satisfactory opinion and/or certificate (unless waived by the Maker), or other evidence, and such written acknowledgement, the Maker, as promptly as practicable, shall notify the Payee that the Payee may sell or otherwise dispose of this Note or Conversion Securities, all in accordance with the terms of the note delivered to the Maker. If a determination has been made pursuant to this
Section 17
that the opinion of counsel for the Payee or other evidence is not reasonably satisfactory to the Maker, the Maker shall so notify the Payee promptly after such determination has been made. Any Note thus transferred shall bear a legend as to the applicable restrictions on transferability in order to ensure compliance with the Securities Act, unless in the opinion of counsel for the Maker such legend is not required in order to ensure compliance with the Securities Act. The Maker may issue stop transfer instructions to its transfer agent in connection with such restrictions. Subject to the foregoing, transfers of this Note shall be registered upon registration on the books maintained for such purpose by or on behalf of the Maker. Prior to presentation of this Note for registration of transfer, the Maker shall treat the registered holder hereof as the owner and holder of this Note for the purpose of receiving all payments of principal hereon and for all other purposes whatsoever, whether or not this Note shall be overdue and the Maker shall not be affected by notice to the contrary.
17.
