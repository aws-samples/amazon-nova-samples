Case: State v. Hasbrouck
Date: 2022-03-04T00:00:00-08:00
Summary:      When the Legislature amends a statute, Kansas courts presume that it intended to
change the law that existed prior to the amendment.


2.
       With the enactment of K.S.A. 2019 Supp. 21-6811(e)(3)(B), the Legislature
replaced all the prior <mark>rules</mark> concerning how out-of-state criminal felony convictions are to
be treated as person or nonperson crimes when a sentencing court is setting the offender&#x27;s
criminal history score.

Case: Salatino v. Chase
Date: 2007-08-31T00:00:00-07:00
Summary: class predominated over individual questions. A year later, the court denied certification, finding that the CFA claim principally raised issues needing individualized proof. Consequently, the court found that common issues did not predominate, as the <mark>rule</mark> requires, and that allowing the action to proceed as a class action would not achieve judicial economy. Plaintiffs did not appeal that denial and did not move to notify putative class members of it.

Case: In re Pers. Restraint of Fletcher
Date: 2024-07-18T00:00:00-07:00
Summary: reimpose the original sentence, with the original, erroneous, calculations. It agreed

with the trial court that the J&amp;S was invalid on its face and hence exempt from the

one-year time bar. It reversed the trial court for a different reason: it <mark>ruled</mark> that

Fletcher’s postconviction motion violated a different procedural rule (the bar on

filing second or successor postconviction motions in certain circumstances). We

denied review.

Date: 2015-09-22T00:00:00-07:00
Summary: Commitment Order did not mention any reporting requirements applicable to Stockert following the completion of his sentence. The presen-tence investigation report (“PSI”) noted that Stockert was not an offender against children, was not a credit <mark>restricted</mark> felon, and would be required to register as a sex offender or violent offender for ten years following his release from incarceration. On the day of sentencing, the probation department provided Stockert with a form titled “Special Conditions for

Summary: material issue of fact is resolved against granting summary judgment, the trial court erred in granting summary judgment. However, the legislature amended La.Code Civ. P. art. 966 in 1996, to provide that, “summary judgment procedure is designed to <mark>secure</mark> the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of every action, except those disallowed by Article 969.

the minimum), which is determined by a statutory formula under R.C. 2929.<mark>144</mark>.

Summary: Gamble appeals from his indefinite, non-life felony sentence

imposed under R.C. 2929.<mark>144</mark>.1 For the following reasons, we affirm.

               Gamble was indicted on seven counts, including trafficking, drug

possession, having weapons while under a disability, and possessing criminal tools.

He ultimately pleaded guilty to one count of trafficking, a second-degree felony

qualifying offense under R.C. 2929.<mark>144</mark>(A), with a one-year firearm specification,

and one count of having weapons while under

Case: State v. Long
Date: 2021-08-04T00:00:00-07:00
Summary: sentences for first and second degree qualifying felonies violates the
       Constitutions of the United States and the State of Ohio, and constitutes
       plain error.

       II. The trial court failed to substantially comply with Ohio Criminal <mark>Rule</mark> 11

       III. Appellant’s sentence under The Reagan Tokes Act is contrary to law,

Summary: New Jersey. We also hold, however, that the district court lacked jurisdiction to determine the government’s rights to the res versus the rest of the world. On the merits, we hold that the district court, on the evidence before it, did not err in <mark>ruling</mark> that Friko is nothing more than a straw man, or alter ego, for Johnny Daccarett (Daccarett), the true owner of the accounts. Thus, the district court was correct in concluding that Friko did not have standing to object to the forfeiture. Accordingly

Summary: market purchasers, and the court will address those challenges separately. Both E & Y and UBS Defendants challenge class certification of the Section 10(b) claims on numerous grounds, but their strongest attack aims at the predominance requirement of <mark>Rule</mark> 23(b)(3). They argue that the bondholders are not entitled to a presumption of reliance under any theory, and that individual issues of reliance thereby would defeat class certification. None of the Defendants5 make any specific challenges based strictly

Summary: securities at issue were issued by two non-party Soloso entities, and the securities are trust-preferred collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) (collectively, the "Soloso securities"). According to the Bank, it learned that it allegedly was not <mark>qualified</mark> to purchase the Soloso securities based on a December 2014 email from SSW. However, despite the purported ineligibility, the record reflects that the Bank continues to hold the securities at issue. The Bank, nonetheless, sued SSW in March 2016 for

Case: Regal Entertainment Group v. AMARANTH LLC
Date: 2006-04-12T00:00:00-07:00
Summary: in transactions in which it would take short- or long-positions regarding the Notes, Amaranth says it should not suffer the burden of serving as the class representative. As of November 2005, Amaranth was the beneficial owner, within the meaning of <mark>Rule</mark> 13d-3 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, of approximately $80,443,000 principal amount of the Notes at issue.[1]
In this opinion, I find that Amaranth's objections are makeweight. Amaranth is the Noteholder that publicly disputed Regal's interpretation

Date: 2010-05-14T00:00:00-07:00
Summary: therefore grant the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment.

I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND
The parties have cross-moved for summary judgment. Neither side points to a disputed issue of fact material to either motion. Accordingly, pursuant to Court of Chancery <mark>Rule</mark> 56(h), the case is deemed submitted for decision on the written record. I find the facts to be as follows.

Summary: executor. The district court held that Virginia’s
claims are barred by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of

“no person may rely upon any conduct that would have been
actionable as <mark>fraud</mark> in the purchase or sale of securities to establish a
violation of [RICO].” 18 U.S.C. § 1964(c). We conclude that Virginia’s
claims are not barred by the RICO Amendment because the fraud she
alleges is not “in the purchase or sale of securities.” Accordingly

       BOGGS, Circuit Judge. In this interlocutory appeal from a district-court order granting
class certification under Federal <mark>Rule</mark> of Civil Procedure 23(b)(3), we are required to grapple
with two major issues of securities-<mark>fraud</mark> law. First, when may a plaintiff class be accorded a
presumption of reliance under the Supreme Court’s decision in Affiliated Ute Citizens of Utah v.
United States, 406 U.S. 128 (1972), in a case that

Case: Lorenzo v. Securities & Exchange Commission
Date: 2017-09-29T00:00:00-07:00
Summary: securities offering. The Commission determined that Lorenzo’s conduct violated various securities-<mark>fraud</mark> provisions. We uphold the Commission’s findings that the statements in Lorenzo’s emails were false or misleading and that he possessed the requisite intent.
We cannot sustain, however, the Commission’s determination that Lorenzo’s conduct violated one of the provisions he was found to have infringed: <mark>Rule</mark> <mark>10b-5</mark>(b). That rule bars the making of materially false statements in connection with the purchase

Date: 2024-10-28T00:00:00-07:00
Summary:            Zhou appeals,

contending the court made two mistakes.                       First, she argues that

defendants&#x27;       motion      to      dismiss        targeted     only     her     material

misrepresentations         and     <mark>omissions</mark>          claim      and,    therefore,      the

district court erred in dismissing her entirely separate &quot;scheme

Summary: District of New York (Torres, J.), we consider whether Lentell v. Merrill

hold that misstatements and omissions alone do not suffice for scheme liability

under <mark>Rule</mark> <mark>10b-5</mark>(a) and (c), has retained its vitality after the Supreme Court’s

Summary: cannot sustain, however, the Commission’s determination that Lorenzo’s conduct violated one of the provisions he was found to have infringed: <mark>Rule</mark> <mark>10b-5</mark>(b). That rule bars the making of <mark>materially</mark> false statements in connection with the purchase or sale of securities. We conclude that Lorenzo did not “make” the false statements at issue for purposes of Rule <mark>10b-5</mark>(b) because Lorenzo’s boss, and not Lorenzo himself, retained “ultimate authority” over the statements.

Summary: pleaded (Jonas v National Life Ins. Co., 147 AD3d 610, 612 [1st Dept 2017]; MP Cool <mark>Invs</mark>. Ltd. v Forkosh, 142 AD3d 286, 291 [1st Dept 2016], lv denied 28 NY3d 911 [2016]).
Initially, the facts alleged in the SAC do not support a claim of fraud against Colbeck Capital Management, LLC (Colbeck) or David Aho (Pludeman v Northern Leasing Sys., Inc., 10 NY3d 486, 492 [2008]). Aho's alleged statement that plaintiff's <mark>investment</mark> was "low risk," was a non-actionable expression of hope (see Zaref v Berk & Michaels

  In May 2007, plaintiff Aozora Bank, Ltd., a <mark>sophisticated investor</mark> in the subprime market, purchased $40 million of notes issued by the Jupiter V CDO, an <mark>investment</mark> vehicle col-lateralized by residential mortgage backed securities and

Date: 2005-01-12T00:00:00-08:00
Summary: 
CONCURRING OPINION BY
Judge PELLEGRINI.
While I join with the majority, I find that the controlling fact in finding that the trial court abused its discretion by refusing to approve the proposed settlement is that the named Claimants, <mark>sophisticated investors</mark> who desire to settle, represent 71% of the limited partnership interests in Keystone Venture. All of the other limited partners declined to participate in the action, some in part because their interests were protected by the named Claimants

Case: Invest Vegas, LLC v. 21st Mortgage Corp. (In re Residential Capital, LLC)
Date: 2016-08-30T00:00:00-07:00
Summary: extinguishes a first priority deed of trust. See SFR <mark>Invs</mark>. Pool 1, LLC v. U.S. Bank, N.A., 334 P.3d 408 (Nev.2014). In this case, the chapter 11 Debtors owned, and then sold in a section 363 free and clear sale, the note and first priority deed of trust on Nevada property that was already subject to an HOA lien. The HOA acquired the property in a nonjudicial foreclosure sale after the Debtors filed their chapter 11 cases.

Case: Coby Group, LLC v. Kriss
Date: 2009-06-23T00:00:00-07:00
Summary: support a reasonable belief by plaintiff that it was ever represented by Kriss separate and apart from his representation of Adjmi (see Jane St. Co. v Rosenberg & Estis, 192 AD2d 451 [1993], lv denied 82 NY2d 654 [1993]). Plaintiff, a <mark>sophisticated real estate investment</mark> company, was introduced to Kriss by Adjmi when plaintiff and Adjmi were contemplating a joint venture. While it appears that Kriss purported to represent plaintiff while Adjmi and plaintiff had coinciding interests in obtaining financing

Case: YS Catering Holdings, Inc. v. Attollo Partners LLC
Date: 2019-06-19T00:00:00-07:00
Summary: fiduciary duty; fraud in the inducement; civil conspiracy to commit fraud; declaratory judgment; injunctive relief; breach of contract; and breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.1
The parties on both sides were experienced, <mark>sophisticated investors</mark> and entrepreneurs. Duchman founded a company, YS Catering, Inc., which provided ready-to-eat meals to customers under the trade name of "The Fresh Diet, Inc." That company, referred to here as "Fresh Diet," entered into a series of bank loans

Case: MP Cool Investments Ltd. v. Forkosh
Date: 2016-09-01T00:00:00-07:00
Summary: scrutinize every required element of a claim of fraud with specific emphasis on the effect of the plaintiff’s status as a so-called <mark>sophisticated investor</mark>. Plaintiff alleges, among other things, that defendants, formerly controlling shareholders in DuCool, Ltd., intentionally provided plaintiff with false information over an extended period of time, inducing it to repeatedly <mark>invest</mark> in DuCool, by claiming the company possessed new technology for innovative heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems

Case: Alan Schmidt v. John Skolas
Date: 2014-10-17T00:00:00-07:00
Summary: passing reference to a weaker burden that Schmidt could actually satisfy, i.e., that he didn’t know the prices until later. But that is not the test or the burden. Schmidt has never come close to setting forth any facts as to why he, a very <mark>sophisticated investor</mark>, who kept himself aware of the value of these assets, could not have known, after the proxy statement revealed the dissolution plan in May 2009, that the sale prices — presumably available through some investigation — were inadequate.2
Indeed

Case: Celle v. Barclays Bank P.L.C.
Date: 2008-02-19T00:00:00-08:00
Summary: plaintiff, a <mark>sophisticated investor</mark>, failed to establish that defendants’ acts or omissions proximately caused a loss of equity in the accounts, liability for which loss was specifically disclaimed in the agreement.
The breach of fiduciary duty claim was properly dismissed as the agreement ‘‘cover[s] the precise subject matter of the alleged fiduciary duty” (id. at 279). Indeed, brokers for nondiscretionary accounts do not owe clients a fiduciary duty (see Fesseha v TD Waterhouse <mark>Inv</mark>. Servs., 305

Case: Zanett Lombardier, Ltd. v. Maslow
Date: 2006-05-30T00:00:00-07:00
Summary: June 30, 2005, which granted defendants’ motion to dismiss the amended complaint, unanimously affirmed, with one bill of costs.
In this action alleging fraud, constructive fraud, misrepresentation and breach of fiduciary duty in connection with an <mark>investment</mark> loss, the court was not required to accept factual allegations that are contradicted by documentary evidence, or legal conclusions that are unsupportable in the face of undisputed facts (Robinson v Robinson, 303 AD2d 234, 235 [2003]). Dismissal

Case: IKB International S.A. v. Stanley
Date: 2016-08-11T00:00:00-07:00

   (Dembeck v 220 Cent. Park S., LLC,
  
  33 AD3d 491, 492 [1st Dept 2006]). Defendants argue that plaintiffs are <mark>sophisticated investors</mark> and have not adequately alleged the justifiable reliance element of their claims, because they made a substantial <mark>investment</mark> without conducting any due diligence of their own to independently appraise the risks attendant to the RMBS in which they invested.

And, although the majority seems to acknowledge this, it nonetheless affirms the dismissal of the complaint notwithstanding that the issue is raised in the context of a CPLR 3211 motion, where the court must accept each and every allegation as true and liberally construe the allegations in the light most favorable to the pleading party, and “determine only

Case: New York City Educational Construction Fund v. Verizon New York Inc.
Date: 2014-02-18T00:00:00-08:00
Summary: 278-279 [2011]; 1537 Assoc. v Kaprielian Enters., 259 AD2d 447 [1st Dept 1999]). This rule is not limited to parties that are contracting for the first time (see Centro, 17 NY3d at 272-274, 278-279). Assuming, arguendo, that plaintiff is not a <mark>sophisticated investor</mark>, it cites no precedential authority for the proposition that only sophisticated investors have a duty to investigate.

Summary: Arlen Realty & Dev. Corp., 112 AD2d 93, 96 [1985]; Bailey Ford v Bailey, 55 AD2d 729, 730 [1976]). There is no indication in the record that Wachovia, a <mark>sophisticated investor</mark>, undertook further investigation to ascertain why the stock symbol it initially entered into its computer system was rejected prior to *271the subject transaction (see G & G <mark>Invs</mark>. v Revlon Consumer Prods. Corp., 283 AD2d 253 [2001]).

Summary: concurring in part and dissenting in part:
  

   Like many large employers, the University of Pennsylvania maintains a retirement plan for its employees. Between 2009 and 2014, the plan's assets increased in value by $ 1.6 billion, a 73% return on <mark>investment</mark>. Despite this increase, plaintiffs have filed a putative class action, claiming that the plan's fiduciaries have imprudently managed it and seeking tens of millions of dollars of damages.

Summary: general public are not covered by the CFA. Cetel v. Kirwan Fin. Grp., *376Inc., 460 F.3d 494, 514 (3d Cir.2006). While the insurance products in question in Cetel were very complex financial instruments, which were marketed only to highly <mark>sophisticated investors</mark> and not to the general public, the rationale for the Cetel court’s decision that the products were not covered by the CFA was not the complexity of the product. This complexity was merely the reason the insurance was not available or marketed

Summary: the signing of this particular loan, “there was no way to know what the damage is [or] what the defaults would have been at that time.”
Stephen Hoyt, the chief manager for Debtors, also testified. Hoyt said he was a knowledgeable and <mark>sophisticated real estate investor</mark> with 33 years of experience in *901commercial real estate.

Date: 2016-09-30T00:00:00-07:00
Summary:  They make other arguments that the court does not believe are necessary to address.


 Of course, Dutchess Ltd. is not a Massachusetts corporation nor a corporation organized under the law of any other of the United States. When <mark>sophisticated investors</mark> elect to <mark>invest</mark> in offshore funds, for their own strategic reasons, they must understand that they are doing so without the protections afforded to investors by the state and federal laws applicable to domestic companies.

Summary: foreclose a mechanic’s lien because: (a) the notice of lien did not substantially comply with the requirements of Idaho Code § 45-507, and (b) the construction contract was void because the contractor had not registered under the Idaho Contractor <mark>Registration</mark> Act before it negotiated and signed the contract. We hold that the claim of lien substantially complied with Idaho Code § 45-507 and that the lien was valid for labor and materials supplied after the contractor registered. We therefore vacate the

Case: Arnold v. Mortgage Electronic Registration Systems, Inc.
Date: 2006-01-26T00:00:00-08:00
Summary: 28 U.S.C. § 1915(a)(1). The court, however, may deny an IFP motion if it finds that the action is not taken in good faith. See 28 U.S.C. § 1915(a)(3).
Both the bankruptcy court and the district court determined that Arnold’s claim to a homestead <mark>exemption</mark> not only was without merit but also was frivolous, meaning that it was not being pursued in good faith. And they were right. The Florida constitutional provision setting out the homestead exemption for that state, says this:
Homestead; exemptions

Before addressing Walker’s points on appeal, we will examine the statutory procedure for determining general medical incompetency.

Summary: “actively engaged as a speech-language pathologist ... on January 6, 1983.” 260 CMR 3.06(4)(5). The Board maintains, as it did initially (AR 22, 73), that the plaintiffs work role on January 6, 1983, was not at the professional level meant by that <mark>exemption</mark>. Those regulations were intended to protect practicing pathologists who were employed in their jobs on that date. The plaintiff, says the Board (AR 22), was “a supervised non-salaried service provider” on January 6 and thus ineligible for the exemption

Against this, the Secretary <mark>offered</mark> a single witness: Robert Harrison, a Clinical Professor of Medicine at the University of California at San Francisco.

 posed code 771 for sour transport plate, and that its pro-
 posed code 759 was justified based on many of the same
 reasons as code 771. J.A. 3088.
      Shortly thereafter, Commerce issued its <mark>preliminary</mark>
 margin calculation for Dillinger, rejecting Dillinger’s pro-
 posed codes 759 and 771. J.A. 4852–53. Commerce issued
 its final determination on March 29, 2017, and, consistent

required the State to allege a flagrant violation where “the reimbursable damage assessment from
the second list [is] to be used in charging a violation under section 1401(c)(3).” Id. Thus, the court
rejected the State’s <mark>circular</mark> reasoning that the charged felony was the required flagrant violation
to charge Hughes with a felony violation. Id. at 832, 392 P.3d at 10. The court then affirmed the
district court’s dismissal of the felony charges for jurisdictional deficiencies

Case: In Re The People of the State of Colorado v. Ashton Michael Whittington.

Summary: District Attorney's Office based on
 violations of Crim. P. 16(I)(b)(1), both in Whittington's
 prosecution and as an alleged pattern in other cases. We
 conclude that the court abused its discretion when it
 excluded evidence as a sanction during the <mark>preliminary</mark>
 hearing without making any of the requisite findings to
 justify imposing that sanction. Based on our conclusion, we
 need not decide whether the county court had jurisdiction to
 impose the sanction. Accordingly, we reverse the county

Summary: general rule should

   other than requiring Midship to participate in proceedings before the ALJ.
           But the FERC overstates the applicability of the authority it <mark>offers</mark>.

       At the plea colloquy on May 22, 1989, defense counsel

See ante, at 1531 - 1536. I dissent, however, from the Court's holding on international exhaustion. A foreign sale, I would hold, does not exhaust a U.S. inventor's

Summary: other, its interest in equal treatment is to inject a substantive component into the analysis that is inconsistent with the Supreme Court’s jurisprudence. This Court respectfully disagrees. To acknowledge that there are limits to the Hunter/Seattle <mark>doctrine</mark> based on the nature of the legislative agenda that is burdened is not to tear the doctrine from its moorings; in fact, the Supreme Court’s decisions placed substantial weight on this variable.
In Hunter, the Court not only stressed that the challenged
