Shares purchased and the date of such purchases. The Company shall deliver to the Holder any objection to any Notice of Exercise within

d)
Mechanics of
Exercise
.
i.
Delivery of Warrant Shares Upon Exercise
. The Company shall cause the Warrant Shares purchased
hereunder to be transmitted by the Transfer Agent to the Holder by crediting the account of the Holder’s or its designee’s
balance account with The Depository Trust Company through its Deposit or Withdrawal at Custodian system (“
DWAC
”) if
the Company is then a participant in such system and either (A) there is an effective registration statement permitting the issuance
of the Warrant Shares to or resale of the Warrant Shares by the Holder or (B) the Warrant Shares are eligible for resale by the Holder
without volume or manner-of-sale limitations pursuant to Rule 144 (assuming cashless exercise of the Warrants), and otherwise by physical
delivery of a certificate, registered in the Company’s share register in the name of the Holder or its designee, for the number
of Warrant Shares to which the Holder is entitled pursuant to such exercise to the address specified by the Holder in the Notice of Exercise
by the date that is the earliest of (i) two (2) Trading Days after the delivery to the Company of the Notice of Exercise, provided that
payment of the aggregate Exercise Price (other than in the instance of a cashless exercise) is received by and (ii) the number of Trading
Days comprising the Standard Settlement Period after the delivery to the Company of the Notice of Exercise, provided that payment of
the aggregate Exercise Price (other than in the instance of a cashless exercise) is received by the Company two (2) Trading Days prior
to such number of Trading Days comprising the Standard Settlement Period after the delivery, (such date, the “
Warrant Share
Delivery Date
”). Upon delivery of the Notice of Exercise, the Holder shall be deemed for all corporate purposes to have become
the holder of record of the Warrant Shares with respect to which this Warrant has been exercised, irrespective of the date of delivery
of the Warrant Shares, provided that payment of the aggregate Exercise Price (other than in the case of a cashless exercise) is received
within the earlier of (i) two (2) Trading Day and (ii) the number of Trading Days comprising the Standard Settlement Period following
delivery of the Notice of Exercise. If the Company fails for any reason (other than failure of the Holder to timely deliver the aggregate
Exercise Price, unless the Warrant is validly exercised by means of a cashless exercise) to deliver or cause the delivery to the Holder
the Warrant Shares subject to a Notice of Exercise by the Warrant Share Delivery Date, the Company shall pay to the Holder, in cash,
as liquidated damages and not as a penalty, for each $1,000 of Warrant Shares subject to such exercise (based on the VWAP of the Common
Stock on the date of the applicable Notice of Exercise), $10 per Trading Day (increasing to $20 per Trading Day on the third Trading
Day after the Warrant Share Delivery Date) for each Trading Day after such Warrant Share Delivery Date until such Warrant Shares are
delivered or Holder rescinds such exercise. The Company agrees to maintain a transfer agent that is a participant in the FAST program
so long as this Warrant remains outstanding and exercisable. As used herein, “Standard Settlement Period” means the standard
settlement period, expressed in a number of Trading Days, on the Company’s primary Trading Market with respect to the Common Stock
as in effect on the date of delivery of the Notice of Exercise
ii.
Delivery of New Warrants Upon Exercise
. If this Warrant shall have been exercised in part,
the Company shall, at the request of a Holder and upon surrender of this Warrant certificate, at the time of delivery of the Warrant Shares,
deliver to the Holder a new Warrant evidencing the rights of the Holder to purchase the unpurchased Warrant Shares called for by this
Warrant, which new Warrant shall in all other respects be identical with this Warrant.
iii.
Rescission Rights
. If the Company fails to cause the Transfer Agent to transmit to the Holder
the Warrant Shares pursuant to Section 2(d)(i) by the Warrant Share Delivery Date, then the Holder will have the right to rescind such
exercise.
3
iv.
Compensation for Buy-In on Failure to Timely Deliver Warrant Shares Upon Exercise
. In addition
to any other rights available to the Holder, if the Company fails to cause the Transfer Agent to transmit to the Holder the Warrant Shares
in accordance with the provisions of Section 2(d)(i) above pursuant to an exercise on or before the Warrant Share Delivery Date (other
than any such failure that is solely due to any action or inaction by the Holder with respect to such exercise), and if after such date
the Holder is required by its broker to purchase (in an open market transaction or otherwise) or the Holder’s brokerage firm otherwise
purchases, shares of Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by the Holder of the Warrant Shares which the Holder anticipated
receiving upon such exercise (a “
Buy-In
”), then the Company shall (A) pay in cash to the Holder the amount, if any,
by which (x) the Holder’s total purchase price (including brokerage commissions, if any) for the shares of Common Stock so purchased
exceeds (y) the amount obtained by multiplying (1) the number of Warrant Shares that the Company was required to deliver to the Holder
in connection with the exercise at issue times (2) the price at which the sell order giving rise to such purchase obligation was executed,
and (B) at the option of the Holder, either reinstate the portion of the Warrant and equivalent number of Warrant Shares for which such
exercise was not honored (in which case such exercise shall be deemed rescinded) or deliver to the Holder the number of shares of Common
Stock that would have been issued had the Company timely complied with its exercise and delivery obligations hereunder. For example, if
the Holder purchases Common Stock having a total purchase price of $11,000 to cover a Buy-In with respect to an attempted exercise of
this Warrant to purchase shares of Common Stock with an aggregate sale price giving rise to such purchase obligation of $10,000, under
clause (A) of the immediately preceding sentence the Company shall be required to pay the Holder $1,000. The Holder shall provide the
Company written notice indicating the amounts payable to the Holder in respect of the Buy-In and, upon request of the Company, evidence
of the amount of such loss. Nothing herein shall limit a Holder’s right to pursue any other remedies available to it hereunder,
at law or in equity including, without limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief with respect to the Company’s
failure to timely deliver shares of Common Stock upon exercise of the Warrant as required pursuant to the terms hereof.
v.
No Fractional Shares or Scrip
. No fractional shares or scrip representing fractional shares
shall be issued upon the exercise of this Warrant. As to any fraction of a share which the Holder would otherwise be entitled to purchase
upon such exercise, the Company shall, at its election, either pay a cash adjustment in respect of such final fraction in an amount equal
to such fraction multiplied by the Exercise Price or round up to the next whole share.
vi.
Charges, Taxes and Expenses
. Issuance of Warrant Shares shall be made without charge to the
Holder for any issue or transfer tax or other incidental expense in respect of the issuance of such Warrant Shares, all of which taxes
and expenses shall be paid by the Company, and such Warrant Shares shall be issued in the name of the Holder or in such name or names
as may be directed by the Holder;
provided
,
however
, that, in the event that Warrant Shares are to be issued in a name other
than the name of the Holder, this Warrant when surrendered for exercise shall be accompanied by the Assignment Form attached hereto duly
executed by the Holder and the Company may require, as a condition thereto, the payment of a sum sufficient to reimburse it for any transfer
tax incidental thereto. The Company shall pay all Transfer Agent fees required for same-day processing of any Notice of Exercise and all
fees to the Depository Trust Company (or another established clearing corporation performing similar functions) required for same-day
electronic delivery of the Warrant Shares.
vii.
Closing of Books
. The Company will not close its shareholder books or records in any manner
which prevents the timely exercise of this Warrant, pursuant to the terms hereof.
4
e)
Holder’s Exercise Limitations
. The Company shall not effect any exercise of this Warrant,
and a Holder shall not have the right to exercise any portion of this Warrant, pursuant to Section 2 or otherwise, to the extent that
after giving effect to such issuance after exercise as set forth on the applicable Notice of Exercise, the Holder would beneficially own
in excess of the Beneficial Ownership Limitation (as defined below). For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the number of Common Stock
beneficially owned by the Holder and its Affiliates and Attribution Parties shall include the number of Common Stock issuable upon exercise
of this Warrant with respect to which such determination is being made, but shall exclude the number of Common Stock which would be issuable
upon (i) exercise of the remaining, nonexercised portion of this Warrant beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its Affiliates or
Attribution Parties and (ii) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or nonconverted portion of any other securities of the Company
(including, without limitation, any other Common Stock Equivalents) subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise analogous to the
limitation contained herein beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its Affiliates or Attribution Parties. For purposes of this Section
2(e), beneficial ownership shall be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, it being acknowledged by the Holder that the Company is not representing to the Holder that such calculation is in compliance
with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the Holder is solely responsible for any schedules required to be filed in accordance therewith.
To the extent that the limitation contained in this Section 2(e) applies, the determination of whether this Warrant is exercisable (in
relation to other securities owned by the Holder together with any Affiliates and Attribution Parties) and of which portion of this Warrant
is exercisable shall be in the sole discretion of the Holder, and the submission of a Notice of Exercise shall be deemed to be the Holder’s
determination of whether this Warrant is exercisable (in relation to other securities owned by the Holder together with any Affiliates
and Attribution Parties) and of which portion of this Warrant is exercisable, in each case subject to the Beneficial Ownership Limitation,
and the Company shall have no obligation to verify or confirm the accuracy of such determination and a submission of a Notice of Exercise
shall be deemed a representation and warranty by the Holder of the foregoing determination. In addition, a determination as to any group
status as contemplated above shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder. For purposes of this Section 2(e), in determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, a Holder may rely on the
number of outstanding shares of Common Stock as reflected in (A) the Company’s most recent periodic or annual report filed with
the Commission, as the case may be, (B) a more recent public announcement by the Company or (C) a more recent written notice by the Company
or the Transfer Agent setting forth the number of Common Stock outstanding. Upon the written or oral request of a Holder, the Company
shall within one Trading Day confirm orally and in writing to the Holder the number of Common Stock then outstanding. In any case, the
number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of securities of the
Company, including this Warrant, by the Holder or its Affiliates or Attribution Parties since the date as of which such number of outstanding
shares of Common Stock was reported. The “
Beneficial Ownership Limitation
” shall be 4.99% of the number of shares of
the Common Stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to the issuance of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this
Warrant. The Holder, upon notice to the Company, may increase or decrease the Beneficial Ownership Limitation provisions of this Section
2(e), provided that the Beneficial Ownership Limitation in no event exceeds 9.99% of the number of Common Stock outstanding immediately
after giving effect to the issuance of Common Stock upon exercise of this Warrant held by the Holder and the provisions of this Section
2(e) shall continue to apply. Any increase in the Beneficial Ownership Limitation will not be effective until the 61
st
day after such notice is delivered to the Company. The provisions of this paragraph shall be construed
and implemented in a manner otherwise than in strict conformity with the terms of this Section 2(e) to correct this paragraph (or any
portion hereof) which may be defective or inconsistent with the intended Beneficial Ownership Limitation herein contained or to make changes
or supplements necessary or desirable to properly give effect to such limitation. The limitations contained in this paragraph shall apply
to a successor holder of this Warrant.
Section 3
.
Certain
Adjustments
.
a)
Stock Dividends and Splits
. If the Company, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding:
(i) pays a stock dividend or otherwise makes a distribution or distributions on shares of its Common Stock or any other equity or equity
equivalent securities payable in Common Stock (which, for avoidance of doubt, shall not include any Common Stock issued by the Company
upon exercise of this Warrant), (ii) subdivides
5
outstanding
Common Stock into a larger number of shares, (iii) combines (including by way of reverse stock split) outstanding Common Stock into a
smaller number of shares, or (iv) issues by reclassification of Common Stock or any other shares of capital stock of the Company, then
in each case the Exercise Price shall be multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of Common Stock (excluding
treasury shares, if any) outstanding immediately before such event and of which the denominator shall be the number of Common Stock outstanding
immediately after such event, and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant shall be proportionately adjusted such that
the aggregate Exercise Price of this Warrant shall remain unchanged. Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 3(a) shall become effective
immediately after the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution and shall become
effective immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or re-classification.
b)
[Intentionally
Omitted.]
c)
Subsequent Rights Offerings
. In addition to any adjustments pursuant to Section 3(a) above,
if at any time the Company grants, issues or sells any Common Stock Equivalents or rights to purchase stock, warrants, securities or other
property pro rata to all of the record holders of any class of Common Stock (the “
Purchase Rights
”), then the Holder
will be entitled to acquire, upon the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights which the Holder could have
acquired if the Holder had held the number of Common Stock acquirable upon complete exercise of this Warrant (without regard to any limitations
on exercise hereof, including without limitation, the Beneficial Ownership Limitation) immediately before the date on which a record is
taken for the grant, issuance or sale of such Purchase Rights, or, if no such record is taken, the date as of which the record holders
of Common Stock are to be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such Purchase Rights (
provided
,
however
, that, to the
extent that the Holder’s right to participate in any such Purchase Right would result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership
Limitation, then the Holder shall not be entitled to participate in such Purchase Right to such extent (or beneficial ownership of such
Common Stock as a result of such Purchase Right to such extent) and such Purchase Right to such extent shall be held in abeyance for the
Holder until such time, if ever, as its right thereto would not result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership Limitation).
d)
Pro Rata Distributions
. During such time as this Warrant is outstanding, if the Company shall
declare or make any dividend or other distribution of its assets (or rights to acquire its assets) to shareholders, by way of return of
capital or otherwise (including, without limitation, any distribution of cash, stock or other securities, property or options by way of
a dividend, spin off, reclassification, corporate rearrangement, scheme of arrangement or other similar transaction) (a “
Distribution
”),
at any time after the issuance of this Warrant, then, in each such case, the Holder shall be entitled to participate in such Distribution
to the same extent that the Holder would have participated therein if the Holder had held the number of Common Stock acquirable upon complete
exercise of this Warrant (without regard to any limitations on exercise hereof, including without limitation, the Beneficial Ownership
Limitation) immediately before the date of which a record is taken for such Distribution, or, if no such record is taken, the date as
of which the record holders of Common Stock are to be determined for the participation in such Distribution (
provided
,
however
,
that, to the extent that the Holder’s right to participate in any such Distribution would result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial
Ownership Limitation, then the Holder shall not be entitled to participate in such Distribution to such extent (or in the beneficial ownership
of any Common Stock as a result of such Distribution to such extent) and the portion of such Distribution shall be held in abeyance for
the benefit of the Holder until such time, if ever, as its right thereto would not result in the Holder exceeding the Beneficial Ownership
Limitation).
e)
Fundamental Transaction
. If, at any time while this Warrant is outstanding, (i) the Company,
directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions effects any merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another Person,
after giving effect to such transaction, the shareholders of the Company immediately prior to such transaction own less than 50% of the
aggregate voting power of the Company or the successor entity of such transaction, (ii) the Company (all of its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole) directly or indirectly, effects any sale, lease, license, assignment, transfer, conveyance or other disposition of all or substantially
all of its assets in one or a series of related transactions, (iii) any, direct or indirect, purchase offer, tender offer or exchange
offer (whether by the Company or another Person) is completed pursuant to
6
which holders of Common Stock
are permitted to sell, tender or exchange their shares for other securities, cash or property and has been accepted by the holders
of 50% or more of the outstanding Common Stock or 50% or more of the voting power of the equity of the Company, (iv) the Company,
directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions effects any reclassification, reorganization or recapitalization of the
Common Stock or any compulsory share exchange pursuant to which the Common Stock are effectively converted into or exchanged for
other securities, cash or property, after giving effect to such transaction, the shareholders of the Company immediately prior to
such transaction own less than 50% of the aggregate voting power of the Company or the successor entity of such transaction, or (v)
the Company, directly or indirectly, in one or more related transactions consummates a share purchase agreement or other business
combination (including, without limitation, a reorganization, recapitalization, spin-off, merger or scheme of arrangement) with
another Person or group of Persons whereby such other Person or group acquires more than 50% of the outstanding Common Stock (not
including any Common Stock held by the other Person or other Persons making or party to, or associated or affiliated with the other
Persons making or party to, such stock or share purchase agreement or other business combination) (each a “
Fundamental
Transaction
”), then, upon any subsequent exercise of this Warrant, the Holder shall have the right to receive, for each
Warrant Share that would have been issuable upon such exercise immediately prior to the occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction,
at the option of the Holder (without regard to any limitation in Section 2(e) on the exercise of this Warrant), the number of Common
Stock of the successor or acquiring corporation or of the Company, if it is the surviving corporation, and any additional
consideration (the “
Alternate Consideration
”) receivable as a result of such Fundamental Transaction by a holder
of the number of Common Stock for which this Warrant is exercisable immediately prior to such Fundamental Transaction (without
regard to any limitation in Section 2(e) on the exercise of this Warrant). For purposes of any such exercise, the determination of
the Exercise Price shall be appropriately adjusted to apply to such Alternate Consideration based on the amount of Alternate
Consideration issuable in respect of one share of Common Stock in such Fundamental Transaction, and the Company shall apportion the
Exercise Price among the Alternate Consideration in a reasonable manner reflecting the relative value of any different components of
the Alternate Consideration. If holders of Common Stock are given any choice as to the securities, cash, or property to be received
in a Fundamental Transaction, then the Holder shall be given the same choice as to the Alternate Consideration it receives upon any
exercise of this Warrant following such Fundamental Transaction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in the event of a
Fundamental Transaction, the Company or any Successor Entity (as defined below) shall, at the Holder’s option, exercisable at
any time concurrently with, or within 30 days after, the consummation of the Fundamental Transaction (or, if later, the date of the
public announcement of the applicable Fundamental Transaction), purchase this Warrant from the Holder by paying to the Holder an
amount of cash equal to the Black Scholes Value (as defined below) of the remaining unexercised portion of this Warrant on the date
of the consummation of such Fundamental Transaction;
provided
,
however
, that, if the Fundamental Transaction is not
within the Company’s control, including not approved by the Company’s Board of Directors, the Holder shall only be
entitled to receive from the Company or any Successor Entity, as of the date of consummation of such Fundamental Transaction, the
same type or form of consideration (and in the same proportion), at the Black Scholes Value of the unexercised portion of this
Warrant, that is being offered and paid to the holders of Common Stock of the Company in connection with the Fundamental
Transaction, whether that consideration be in the form of cash, stock or any combination thereof, or whether the holders of Common
Stock are given the choice to receive from among alternative forms of consideration in connection with the Fundamental Transaction;
provided
,
further
,
that if holders of Common Stock of the Company are not offered or paid any consideration in such Fundamental Transaction, such
holders of Common Stock will be deemed to have received the equivalent equity of the Successor Entity (which Entity may be the
Company following such Fundamental Transaction) in such Fundamental Transaction. “
Black Scholes Value
” means the
value of this Warrant based on the Black- Scholes Option Pricing Model obtained from the “OV” function on Bloomberg
determined as of the day of consummation of the applicable Fundamental Transaction for pricing purposes and reflecting (A) a
risk-free interest rate corresponding to the U.S. Treasury rate for a period equal to the time between the date of the public
announcement of the applicable contemplated Fundamental Transaction and the Termination Date, (B) an expected volatility equal to
the greater of (1) the 30 day volatility, (2) the 100 day volatility or (3) the 365 day volatility, each of clauses (1)-(3) as
obtained from the HVT function on Bloomberg (determined utilizing a 365 day annualization factor) as of the Trading Day immediately
following the public announcement of the applicable contemplated Fundamental Transaction, (C) the underlying price per share used in
such calculation shall be the highest VWAP during the period beginning on the Trading Day
7
immediately preceding the public
announcement of the applicable contemplated Fundamental Transaction (or the consummation of the applicable Fundamental Transaction, if
earlier) and ending on the Trading Day of the Holder’s request pursuant to this Section 3(e) and (D) a remaining option time equal
to the time between the date of the public announcement of the applicable contemplated Fundamental Transaction and the Termination Date
and (E) a zero cost of borrow. The payment of the Black Scholes Value will be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds (or
such other consideration) within the later of (i) five Business Days of the Holder’s election and (ii) the date of consummation
of the Fundamental Transaction. The Company shall cause any successor entity in a Fundamental Transaction in which the Company is not
the survivor (the “
Successor Entity
”) to assume in writing all of the obligations of the Company under this Warrant
in accordance with the provisions of this Section 3(e) pursuant to written agreements in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
the Holder and approved by the Holder (without unreasonable delay) prior to such Fundamental Transaction and shall, at the option of the
Holder, deliver to the Holder in exchange for this Warrant a security of the Successor Entity evidenced by a written instrument substantially
similar in form and substance to this Warrant which is exercisable for a corresponding number of shares of capital stock of such Successor
Entity (or its parent entity) equivalent to the Common Stock acquirable and receivable upon exercise of this Warrant (without regard to
any limitations on the exercise of this Warrant) prior to such Fundamental Transaction, and with an exercise price which applies the exercise
price hereunder to such shares of capital stock (but taking into account the relative value of the Common Stock pursuant to such Fundamental
Transaction and the value of such shares of capital stock, such number of shares of capital stock and such exercise price being for the
purpose of protecting the economic value of this Warrant immediately prior to the consummation of such Fundamental Transaction), and which
is reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Holder. Upon the occurrence of any such Fundamental Transaction, the Successor
Entity shall succeed to, and be substituted for (so that from and after the date of such Fundamental Transaction, the provisions of this
Warrant referring to the “Company” shall refer instead to the Successor Entity), and may exercise every right and power of
the Company and shall assume all of the obligations of the Company under this Warrant with the same effect as if such Successor Entity
had been named as the Company herein. For the avoidance of doubt, the Holder shall be entitled to the benefits of the provisions of this
Section 3(e) regardless of whether the Company has sufficient authorized Common Stock for the issuance of Warrant
Shares.
For the avoidance
of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the offering and other transactions contemplated by the Securities Purchase Agreement
shall not be deemed to constitute a Fundamental Transaction for purposes hereof.
f)
Calculations
. All calculations under this Section 3 shall be made to the nearest cent or the
nearest 1/100th of a share, as the case may be. For purposes of this Section 3, the number of Common Stock deemed to be issued and outstanding
as of a given date shall be the sum of the number of Common Stock (excluding treasury shares, if any) issued and outstanding.
g)
Notice to
Holder.
i.
Exercise Price. Whenever the Exercise Price is adjusted pursuant to any provision of this Section 3, the Company shall promptly deliver
to the Holder by email a notice setting forth the Exercise Price after such adjustment and any resulting adjustment to the number of Warrant
Shares and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such adjustment.
ii.
Notice to Allow Exercise by Holder
. If (A) the Company shall declare a Distribution on the
Common Stock, (B) the Company shall declare a special nonrecurring cash dividend on or a redemption of the Common Stock, (C) the Company
shall authorize the granting to all holders of the Common Stock rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any shares of capital
stock of any class or of any rights, (D) the approval of any shareholders of the Company shall be required in connection with any reclassification
of the Common Stock, any consolidation or merger to which the Company (and of its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole) is a party, any sale
or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, or any compulsory share exchange whereby the Common Stock
8
are converted into other securities,
cash or property, or (E) the Company shall authorize the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs
of the Company, then, in each case, the Company shall cause to be delivered by email to the Holder at its latest email address as it shall
appear upon the Warrant Register of the Company, at least 20 Business Days prior to the applicable record or effective date hereinafter
specified, a notice stating (x) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution, redemption,
rights or warrants, or if a record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of the Common Stock of record to be entitled to
such dividend, distributions, redemption, rights or warrants are to be determined or (y) the date on which such reclassification, consolidation,
merger, sale, transfer or share exchange is expected to become effective or close, and the date as of which it is expected that holders
of the Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange their shares of the Common Stock for securities, cash or other property deliverable
upon such reclassification, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer or share exchange; provided that the failure to deliver such notice
or any defect therein or in the delivery thereof shall not affect the validity of the corporate action required to be specified in such
notice. To the extent that any notice provided in this Warrant constitutes, or contains, material, non-public information regarding the
Company or any of the Subsidiaries, the Company shall simultaneously file such notice with the Commission pursuant to a Report of Foreign
Private Issuer on Form 6-K. The Holder shall remain entitled to exercise this Warrant during the period commencing on the date of such
notice to the effective date of the event triggering such notice except as may otherwise be expressly set forth herein.
Section 4
.
Transfer of
Warrant
.
a)
Transferability
. This Warrant and all rights hereunder are transferable, in whole or in part,
upon surrender of this Warrant at the principal office of the Company or its designated agent, together with a written assignment of this
Warrant substantially in the form attached hereto duly executed by the Holder or its agent or attorney and funds sufficient to pay any
transfer taxes payable upon the making of such transfer. Upon such surrender and, if required, such payment, the Company shall execute
and deliver a new Warrant or Warrants in the name of the assignee or assignees, as applicable, and in the denomination or denominations
specified in such instrument of assignment and shall issue to the assignor a new Warrant evidencing the portion of this Warrant not so
assigned, and this Warrant shall promptly be cancelled. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Holder shall not be required
to physically surrender this Warrant to the Company unless the Holder has assigned this Warrant in full, in which case, the Holder shall
surrender this Warrant to the Company within three (3) Trading Days of the date on which the Holder delivers an assignment form to the
Company assigning this Warrant in full. The Warrant, if properly assigned in accordance herewith, may be exercised by a new holder for
the purchase of Warrant Shares without having a new Warrant issued.
b)
New Warrants
. This Warrant may be divided or combined with other Warrants upon presentation
hereof at the aforesaid office of the Company, together with a written notice specifying the names and denominations in which new Warrants
are to be issued, signed by the Holder or its agent or attorney. Subject to compliance with Section 4(a), as to any transfer which may
be involved in such division or combination, the Company shall execute and deliver a new Warrant or Warrants in exchange for the Warrant
or Warrants to be divided or combined in accordance with such notice. All Warrants issued on transfers or exchanges shall be dated the
initial issuance date of this Warrant and shall be identical with this Warrant except as to the number of Warrant Shares issuable pursuant
thereto.
c)
Warrant Register
. The Company shall register this Warrant, upon records to be maintained by
the Company for that purpose (the “
Warrant Register
”), in the name of the record Holder hereof from time to time. The
Company may deem and treat the registered Holder of this Warrant as the absolute owner hereof for the purpose of any exercise hereof or
any distribution to the Holder, and for all other purposes, absent actual notice to the contrary.
d)
[Intentionally
Omitted]
9
e)
Representation by the Holder
. The Holder, by the acceptance hereof, represents and warrants
that it is acquiring this Warrant and, upon any exercise hereof, will acquire the Warrant Shares issuable upon such exercise, for its
own account and not with a view to or for distributing or reselling such Warrant Shares or any part thereof in violation of the Securities
Act or any applicable state securities law, except pursuant to sales registered or exempted under the Securities Act.
Section 5
.
Miscellaneous
.
a)
No Rights as Shareholder Until Exercise; No Settlement in Cash
. This Warrant does not entitle
the Holder to any voting rights, dividends or other rights as a shareholder of the Company prior to the exercise hereof as set forth in
Section 2(d)(i), except as expressly set forth in Section 3. Without limiting any rights of a Holder to receive Warrant Shares on a “cashless
exercise” upon Company approval pursuant to Section 2(c) or to receive cash payments pursuant to Section 2(d)(i) and Section 2(d)(iv)
herein, in no event shall the Company be required to net cash settle an exercise of this Warrant.
b)
Loss, Theft, Destruction or Mutilation of Warrant
. The Company covenants that upon receipt
by the Company of evidence reasonably satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Warrant or any stock certificate
relating to the Warrant Shares, and in case of loss, theft or destruction, of indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to it (which,
in the case of the Warrant, shall not include the posting of any bond), and upon surrender and cancellation of such Warrant or stock certificate,
if mutilated, the Company will make and deliver a new Warrant or stock certificate of like tenor and dated as of such cancellation, in
lieu of such Warrant or stock certificate.
c)
Saturdays, Sundays, Holidays, etc
. If the last or appointed day for the taking of any action
or the expiration of any right required or granted herein shall not be a Business Day, then such action may be taken or such right may
be exercised on the next succeeding Business Day.
d)
Authorized Shares
. The Company covenants that, during the period the Warrant is outstanding,
it will reserve from its authorized and unissued Common Stock a sufficient number of shares to provide for the issuance of the Warrant
Shares upon the exercise of any purchase rights under this Warrant. The Company further covenants that its issuance of this Warrant shall
constitute full authority to its officers who are charged with the duty of issuing the necessary Warrant Shares upon the exercise of the
purchase rights under this Warrant. The Company will take all such reasonable action as may be necessary to assure that such Warrant Shares
may be issued as provided herein without violation of any applicable law or regulation, or of any requirements of the Trading Market upon
which the Common Stock may be listed. The Company covenants that all Warrant Shares which may be issued upon the exercise of the purchase
rights represented by this Warrant will, upon exercise of the purchase rights represented by this Warrant and payment for such Warrant
Shares in accordance herewith, be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free from all taxes, liens and charges
created by the Company in respect of the issue thereof (other than taxes in respect of any transfer occurring contemporaneously with such
issue). Except and to the extent as waived or consented to by the Holder, the Company shall not by any action, including, without limitation,
amending its certificate of incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue
or sale of securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the terms of this
Warrant, but will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all such terms and in the taking of all such actions as may
be necessary or appropriate to protect the rights of Holder as set forth in this Warrant against impairment. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the Company will (i) not increase the par value of any Warrant Shares above the amount payable therefor upon such exercise
immediately prior to such increase in par value, (ii) take all such action as may be necessary or appropriate in order that the Company
may validly and legally issue fully paid and nonassessable Warrant Shares upon the exercise of this Warrant and (iii) use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain all such authorizations, exemptions or consents from any public regulatory body having jurisdiction thereof,
as may be, necessary to enable the Company to perform its obligations under this Warrant. Before taking any action, which would result
in an adjustment in the number of Warrant Shares for which this Warrant is exercisable or in the Exercise Price, the Company shall obtain
all such authorizations or exemptions thereof, or consents thereto, as may be necessary from any public regulatory
body or bodies having jurisdiction
thereof.
10
e)
Jurisdiction
. All questions concerning the construction, validity, enforcement and interpretation
of this Warrant shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Securities Purchase Agreement.
f)
[Intentionally
Omitted.]
g)
Nonwaiver and Expenses
. No course of dealing or any delay or failure to exercise any right
hereunder on the part of Holder shall operate as a waiver of such right or otherwise prejudice the Holder’s rights, powers or remedies.
Without limiting any other provision of this Warrant or the Underwriting Agreement, if the Company willfully and knowingly fails to comply
with any provision of this Warrant, which results in any material damages to the Holder, the Company shall pay to the Holder such amounts
as shall be sufficient to cover any costs and expenses including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys’ fees, including those
of appellate proceedings, incurred by the Holder in collecting any amounts due pursuant hereto or in otherwise enforcing any of its rights,
powers or remedies hereunder.
h)
Notices
. Any notice, request or other document required or permitted to be given or delivered
to the Holder by the Company shall be delivered in accordance with the notice provisions of the Underwriting
Agreement.
i)
Limitation of Liability
. No provision hereof, in the absence of any affirmative action by the Holder to exercise this Warrant to
purchase Warrant Shares, and no enumeration herein of the rights or privileges of the Holder, shall give rise to any liability of the
Holder for the purchase price of any Common Stock or as a shareholder of the Company, whether such liability is asserted by the Company
or by creditors of the
Company.
j)
Remedies
. The Holder, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights granted by law,
including recovery of damages, will be entitled to specific performance of its rights under this Warrant. The Company agrees that monetary
damages would not be adequate compensation for any loss incurred by reason of a breach by it of the provisions of this Warrant and hereby
agrees to waive and not to assert the defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at law would be adequate.
k)
Successors and Assigns
. Subject to applicable securities laws, this Warrant and the rights
and obligations evidenced hereby shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors and permitted assigns of the Company
and the successors and permitted assigns of Holder. The provisions of this Warrant are intended to be for the benefit of any Holder from
time to time of this Warrant and shall be enforceable by the Holder or holder of Warrant Shares.
l)
Amendment
. This Warrant may be modified or amended or the provisions hereof waived with the
written consent of the Company, on the one hand, and the Holder or the beneficial owner of this Warrant, on the other hand.
m)
Severability
. Wherever possible, each provision of this Warrant shall be interpreted in such
manner as to be effective and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this Warrant shall be prohibited by or invalid under
applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder
of such provisions or the remaining provisions of this Warrant.
n)
Headings
. The headings used in this Warrant are for the convenience of reference only and
shall not, for any purpose, be deemed a part of this Warrant.
