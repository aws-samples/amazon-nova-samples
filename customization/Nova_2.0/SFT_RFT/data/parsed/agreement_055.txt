Provisions for Payment
.
The Securities shall be issuable
as registered Securities and in the denominations of one thousand U.S. dollars ($1,000) or any integral multiple thereof, subject to Section 2.01(a)(10).
The Securities of a particular
series shall bear interest payable on the dates and at the rate specified with respect to that series. Subject to Section 2.01(a)(16),
the principal of and the interest on the Securities of any series, as well as any premium thereon in case of redemption thereof prior
to maturity, shall be payable in the coin or currency of the United States of America that at the time is legal tender for public and
private debt, at the office or agency of the Company maintained for that purpose. Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication.
Interest on the Securities shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year composed of twelve 30-day months.
The interest installment
on any Security that is payable, and is punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date for Securities of that series
shall be paid to the Person in whose name said Security (or one or more Predecessor Securities) is registered at the close of business
on the regular record date for such interest installment. In the event that any Security of a particular series or portion thereof is
called for redemption and the redemption date is subsequent to a regular record date with respect to any Interest Payment Date and prior
to such Interest Payment Date, interest on such Security will be paid upon presentation and surrender of such Security as provided in
Section 3.03.
Any interest on any Security
that is payable, but is not punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date for Securities of the same series (herein
called “Defaulted Interest”) shall forthwith cease to be payable to the registered holder on the relevant regular record date
by virtue of having been such holder; and such Defaulted Interest shall be paid by the Company, at its election, as provided in clause
(1) or clause (2) below:
(i) The Company may
make payment of any Defaulted Interest on Securities to the Persons in whose names such Securities (or their respective Predecessor Securities)
are registered at the close of business on a special record date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which shall be fixed in the
following manner: the Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid on each such
Security and the date of the proposed payment, and at the same time the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal
to the aggregate amount proposed to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee
for such deposit prior to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held in trust for the benefit of the Persons
entitled to such Defaulted Interest as in this clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a special record date for the payment
of such Defaulted Interest which shall not be more than fifteen (15) nor less than ten (10) days prior to the date of the proposed payment
and not less than ten (10) days after the receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly notify
the Company of such special record date and, in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment
of such Defaulted Interest and the special record date therefor to be mailed, first class postage prepaid, to each Securityholder at his
or her address as it appears in the Security Register (as hereinafter defined), not less than ten (10) days prior to such special record
date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the special record date therefor having been mailed as aforesaid,
such Defaulted Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names such Securities (or their respective Predecessor Securities) are registered
on such special record date.
(ii) The Company may
make payment of any Defaulted Interest on any Securities in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any securities
exchange on which such Securities may be listed, and upon such notice as may be required by such exchange, if, after notice given by the
Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to this clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the Trustee.
Unless otherwise set forth
in a Board Resolution or one or more indentures supplemental hereto establishing the terms of any series of Securities pursuant to Section 2.01
hereof, the term “regular record date” as used in this Section with respect to a series of Securities and any Interest
Payment Date for such series shall mean either the fifteenth day of the month immediately preceding the month in which an Interest Payment
Date established for such series pursuant to Section 2.01 hereof shall occur, if such Interest Payment Date is the first day of a
month, or the first day of the month in which an Interest Payment Date established for such series pursuant to Section 2.01 hereof
shall occur, if such Interest Payment Date is the fifteenth (15
th
) day of a month, whether or not such date is a Business Day.
Subject to the foregoing
provisions of this Section, each Security of a series delivered under this Indenture upon transfer of or in exchange for or in lieu of
any other Security of such series shall carry the rights to interest accrued and unpaid, and to accrue, that were carried by such other
Security.

Section 2.4 Execution
and Authentications
.
The Securities shall be signed
on behalf of the Company by one of its Officers. Signatures may be in the form of a manual or facsimile signature.
The Company may use the facsimile
signature of any Person who shall have been an Officer, notwithstanding the fact that at the time the Securities shall be authenticated
and delivered or disposed of such Person shall have ceased to be such an officer of the Company. The Securities may contain such notations,
legends or endorsements required by law, stock exchange rule or usage. Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication
by the Trustee.
A Security shall not be valid
until authenticated manually by an authorized signatory of the Trustee, or by an Authenticating Agent. Such signature shall be conclusive
evidence that the Security so authenticated has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder and that the holder is entitled to the
benefits of this Indenture. At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Indenture, the Company may deliver
Securities of any series executed by the Company to the Trustee for authentication, together with a written order of the Company for the
authentication and delivery of such Securities, signed by an Officer, and the Trustee in accordance with such written order shall authenticate
and deliver such Securities.
In authenticating such Securities
and accepting the additional responsibilities under this Indenture in relation to such Securities, the Trustee shall be entitled to receive,
if requested, and (subject to Section 7.01) shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel stating that the form
and terms thereof have been established in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture.
The Trustee shall not be
required to authenticate such Securities if the issue of such Securities pursuant to this Indenture will affect the Trustee’s own
rights, duties or immunities under the Securities and this Indenture or otherwise in a manner that is not reasonably acceptable to the
Trustee.
Section 2.5 Registration of
Transfer and Exchange.
(a) Securities of any
series may be exchanged upon presentation thereof at the office or agency of the Company designated for such purpose, for other Securities
of such series of authorized denominations, and for a like aggregate principal amount, upon payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax
or other governmental charge in relation thereto, all as provided in this Section. In respect of any Securities so surrendered for exchange,
the Company shall execute, the Trustee shall authenticate and such office or agency shall deliver in exchange therefor the Security or
Securities of the same series that the Securityholder making the exchange shall be entitled to receive, bearing numbers not contemporaneously
outstanding.
(b) The Company shall
keep, or cause to be kept, at its office or agency designated for such purpose a register or registers (herein referred to as the “Security
Register”) in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company shall register the Securities and the
transfers of Securities as in this Article provided and which at all reasonable times shall be open for inspection by the Trustee.
The registrar for the purpose of registering Securities and transfer of Securities as herein provided shall be appointed as authorized
by Board Resolution (the “Security Registrar”).
Upon surrender for transfer
of any Security at the office or agency of the Company designated for such purpose, the Company shall execute, the Trustee shall authenticate
and such office or agency shall deliver in the name of the transferee or transferees a new Security or Securities of the same series as
the Security presented for a like aggregate principal amount.

All Securities presented
or surrendered for exchange or registration of transfer, as provided in this Section, shall be accompanied (if so required by the Company
or the Security Registrar) by a written instrument or instruments of transfer, in form satisfactory to the Company or the Security Registrar,
duly executed by the registered holder or by such holder’s duly authorized attorney in writing.
(c) Except as provided
pursuant to Section 2.01 pursuant to a Board Resolution, and set forth in an Officer’s Certificate, or established in one or
more indentures supplemental to this Indenture, no service charge shall be made for any exchange or registration of transfer of Securities,
or issue of new Securities in case of partial redemption of any series, but the Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover
any tax or other governmental charge in relation thereto, other than exchanges pursuant to Section 2.06, Section 3.03(b) and
Section 9.04 not involving any transfer.
(d) The Company shall
not be required (i) to issue, exchange or register the transfer of any Securities during a period beginning at the opening of business
fifteen (15) days before the day of the mailing of a notice of redemption of less than all the Outstanding Securities of the same series
and ending at the close of business on the day of such mailing, nor (ii) to register the transfer of or exchange any Securities of
any series or portions thereof called for redemption, other than the unredeemed portion of any such Securities being redeemed in part.
The provisions of this Section 2.05 are, with respect to any Global Security, subject to Section 2.11 hereof.
Section 2.6 Temporary Securities.
Pending the preparation of
definitive Securities of any series, the Company may execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, temporary Securities (printed,
lithographed or typewritten) of any authorized denomination. Such temporary Securities shall be substantially in the form of the definitive
Securities in lieu of which they are issued, but with such omissions, insertions and variations as may be appropriate for temporary Securities,
all as may be determined by the Company. Every temporary Security of any series shall be executed by the Company and be authenticated
by the Trustee upon the same conditions and in substantially the same manner, and with like effect, as the definitive Securities of such
series. Without unnecessary delay the Company will execute and will furnish definitive Securities of such series and thereupon any or
all temporary Securities of such series may be surrendered in exchange therefor (without charge to the holders), at the office or agency
of the Company designated for the purpose, and the Trustee shall authenticate and such office or agency shall deliver in exchange for
such temporary Securities an equal aggregate principal amount of definitive Securities of such series, unless the Company advises the
Trustee to the effect that definitive Securities need not be executed and furnished until further notice from the Company. Until so exchanged,
the temporary Securities of such series shall be entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as definitive Securities of such series
authenticated and delivered hereunder.
Section 2.7 Mutilated,
Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Securities
.
In case any temporary or
definitive Security shall become mutilated or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Company (subject to the next succeeding sentence) shall
execute, and upon the Company’s request the Trustee (subject as aforesaid) shall authenticate and deliver, a new Security of the
same series, bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding, in exchange and substitution for the mutilated Security, or in lieu of
and in substitution for the Security so destroyed, lost or stolen. In every case the applicant for a substituted Security shall furnish
to the Company and the Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless, and, in every case
of destruction, loss or theft, the applicant shall also furnish to the Company and the Trustee evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction,
loss or theft of the applicant’s Security and of the ownership thereof. The Trustee may authenticate any such substituted Security
and deliver the same upon the written request or authorization of any officer of the Company. Upon the issuance of any substituted Security,
the Company may require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed in relation
thereto and any other expenses (including the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.
In case any Security that
has matured or is about to mature shall become mutilated or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the Company may, instead of issuing a substitute
Security, pay or authorize the payment of the same (without surrender thereof except in the case of a mutilated Security) if the applicant
for such payment shall furnish to the Company and the Trustee such security or indemnity as they may require to save them harmless, and,
in case of destruction, loss or theft, evidence to the satisfaction of the Company and the Trustee of the destruction, loss or theft of
such Security and of the ownership thereof.
Every replacement Security
issued pursuant to the provisions of this Section shall constitute an additional contractual obligation of the Company whether or
not the mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall be found at any time, or be enforceable by anyone, and shall be entitled to
all the benefits of this Indenture equally and proportionately with any and all other Securities of the same series duly issued hereunder.
All Securities shall be held and owned upon the express condition that the foregoing provisions are exclusive with respect to the replacement
or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities, and shall preclude (to the extent lawful) any and all other rights or remedies,
notwithstanding any law or statute existing or hereafter enacted to the contrary with respect to the replacement or payment of negotiable
instruments or other securities without their surrender.

Section 2.8 Cancellation.
All Securities surrendered
for the purpose of payment, redemption, exchange or registration of transfer shall, if surrendered to the Company or any paying agent,
be delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, or, if surrendered to the Trustee, shall be cancelled by it, and no Securities shall be
issued in lieu thereof except as expressly required or permitted by any of the provisions of this Indenture. On request of the Company
at the time of such surrender, the Trustee shall deliver to the Company canceled Securities held by the Trustee. In the absence of such
request the Trustee may dispose of canceled Securities in accordance with its standard procedures and deliver a certificate of disposition
to the Company. If the Company shall otherwise acquire any of the Securities, however, such acquisition shall not operate as a redemption
or satisfaction of the indebtedness represented by such Securities unless and until the same are delivered to the Trustee for cancellation.
Section 2.9 Benefits of Indenture.
Nothing in this Indenture
or in the Securities, express or implied, shall give or be construed to give to any Person, other than the parties hereto and the holders
of the Securities any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Indenture, or under any covenant, condition
or provision herein contained; all such covenants, conditions and provisions being for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and of the
holders of the Securities.
Section 2.10 Authenticating
Agent.
So long as any of the Securities
of any series remain Outstanding there may be an Authenticating Agent for any or all such series of Securities which the Trustee shall
have the right to appoint. Said Authenticating Agent shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee to authenticate Securities of
such series issued upon exchange, transfer or partial redemption thereof, and Securities so authenticated shall be entitled to the benefits
of this Indenture and shall be valid and obligatory for all purposes as if authenticated by the Trustee hereunder. All references in this
Indenture to the authentication of Securities by the Trustee shall be deemed to include authentication by an Authenticating Agent for
such series. Each Authenticating Agent shall be acceptable to the Company and shall be a corporation that has a combined capital and surplus,
as most recently reported or determined by it, sufficient under the laws of any jurisdiction under which it is organized or in which it
is doing business to conduct a trust business, and that is otherwise authorized under such laws to conduct such business and is subject
to supervision or examination by federal or state authorities. If at any time any Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in accordance
with these provisions, it shall resign immediately.
Any Authenticating Agent
may at any time resign by giving written notice of resignation to the Trustee and to the Company. The Trustee may at any time (and upon
request by the Company shall) terminate the agency of any Authenticating Agent by giving written notice of termination to such Authenticating
Agent and to the Company. Upon resignation, termination or cessation of eligibility of any Authenticating Agent, the Trustee may appoint
an eligible successor Authenticating Agent acceptable to the Company. Any successor Authenticating Agent, upon acceptance of its appointment
hereunder, shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of its predecessor hereunder as if originally named as an Authenticating
Agent pursuant hereto.
Section 2.11 Global Securities.
(a) If the Company shall
establish pursuant to Section 2.01 that the Securities of a particular series are to be issued as a Global Security, then the Company
shall execute and the Trustee shall, in accordance with Section 2.04, authenticate and deliver, a Global Security that (i) shall
represent, and shall be denominated in an amount equal to the aggregate principal amount of, all of the Outstanding Securities of such
series, (ii) shall be registered in the name of the Depositary or its nominee, (iii) shall be delivered by the Trustee to the
Depositary or pursuant to the Depositary’s instruction and (iv) shall bear a legend substantially to the following effect:
“Except as otherwise provided in Section 2.11 of the Indenture, this Security may be transferred, in whole but not in part,
only to another nominee of the Depositary or to a successor Depositary or to a nominee of such successor Depositary.”
(b) Notwithstanding
the provisions of Section 2.05, the Global Security of a series may be transferred, in whole but not in part and in the manner provided
in Section 2.05, only to another nominee of the Depositary for such series, or to a successor Depositary for such series selected
or approved by the Company or to a nominee of such successor Depositary.
(c) If at any time the
Depositary for a series of the Securities notifies the Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such series
or if at any time the Depositary for such series shall no longer be registered or in good standing under the Exchange Act, or other applicable
statute or regulation, and a successor Depositary for such series is not appointed by the Company within 90 days after the Company receives
such notice or becomes aware of such condition, as the case may be, or if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Company
has received a request from the Depositary or from the Trustee, this Section 2.11 shall no longer be applicable to the Securities
of such series and the Company will execute, and subject to Section 2.04, the Trustee will authenticate and deliver the Securities
of such series in definitive registered form without coupons, in authorized denominations, and in an aggregate principal amount equal
to the principal amount of the Global Security of such series in exchange for such Global Security. In addition, the Company may at any
time determine that the Securities of any series shall no longer be represented by a Global Security and that the provisions of this Section 2.11
shall no longer apply to the Securities of such series. In such event the Company will execute and, subject to Section 2.04, the
Trustee, upon receipt of an Officer’s Certificate evidencing such determination by the Company, will authenticate and deliver the
Securities of such series in definitive registered form without coupons, in authorized denominations, and in an aggregate principal amount
equal to the principal amount of the Global Security of such series in exchange for such Global Security. Upon the exchange of the Global
Security for such Securities in definitive registered form without coupons, in authorized denominations, the Global Security shall be
canceled by the Trustee. Such Securities in definitive registered form issued in exchange for the Global Security pursuant to this Section 2.11(c) shall
be registered in such names and in such authorized denominations as the Depositary, pursuant to instructions from its direct or indirect
participants or otherwise, shall instruct the Trustee. The Trustee shall deliver such Securities to the Depositary for delivery to the
Persons in whose names such Securities are so registered.

ARTICLE III
REDEMPTION OF SECURITIES AND SINKING FUND PROVISIONS
Section 3.1 Redemption.
The Company may redeem the
Securities of any series issued hereunder on and after the dates and in accordance with the terms established for such series pursuant
to Section 2.01 hereof.
Section 3.2 Notice of Redemption
.
(a) In case the Company
shall desire to exercise such right to redeem all or, as the case may be, a portion of the Securities of any series in accordance with
any right the Company reserved for itself to do so pursuant to Section 2.01 hereof, the Company shall, or shall cause the Trustee
to, give notice of such redemption to holders of the Securities of such series to be redeemed by mailing, first class postage prepaid,
a notice of such redemption not less than 30 days and not more than 90 days before the date fixed for redemption of that series to such
holders at their last addresses as they shall appear upon the Security Register, unless a shorter period is specified in the Securities
to be redeemed. Any notice that is mailed in the manner herein provided shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether
or not the registered holder receives the notice. In any case, failure duly to give such notice to the holder of any Security of any series
designated for redemption in whole or in part, or any defect in the notice, shall not affect the validity of the proceedings for the redemption
of any other Securities of such series or any other series. In the case of any redemption of Securities prior to the expiration of any
restriction on such redemption provided in the terms of such Securities or elsewhere in this Indenture, the Company shall furnish the
Trustee with an Officer’s Certificate evidencing compliance with any such restriction.
Each such notice of redemption
shall specify the date fixed for redemption and the redemption price at which Securities of that series are to be redeemed, and shall
state that payment of the redemption price of such Securities to be redeemed will be made at the office or agency of the Company, upon
presentation and surrender of such Securities, that interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption will be paid as specified in said
notice, that from and after said date interest will cease to accrue and that the redemption is from a sinking fund, if such is the case.
If less than all the Securities of a series are to be redeemed, the notice to the holders of Securities of that series to be redeemed
in part shall specify the particular Securities to be so redeemed.
In case any Security is to
be redeemed in part only, the notice that relates to such Security shall state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed,
and shall state that on and after the redemption date, upon surrender of such Security, a new Security or Securities of such series in
principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion thereof will be issued.
(b) If less than all
the Securities of a series are to be redeemed, the Company shall give the Trustee at least 45 days’ notice (unless a shorter notice
shall be satisfactory to the Trustee) in advance of the date fixed for redemption as to the aggregate principal amount of Securities of
the series to be redeemed, and thereupon the Trustee shall select, by lot or in such other manner as it shall deem appropriate and fair
in its discretion and that may provide for the selection of a portion or portions (equal to one thousand U.S. dollars ($1,000) or any
integral multiple thereof) of the principal amount of such Securities of a denomination larger than $1,000, the Securities to be redeemed
and shall thereafter promptly notify the Company in writing of the numbers of the Securities to be redeemed, in whole or in part. The
Company may, if and whenever it shall so elect, by delivery of instructions signed on its behalf by an Officer, instruct the Trustee or
any paying agent to call all or any part of the Securities of a particular series for redemption and to give notice of redemption in the
manner set forth in this Section, such notice to be in the name of the Company or its own name as the Trustee or such paying agent may
deem advisable. In any case in which notice of redemption is to be given by the Trustee or any such paying agent, the Company shall deliver
or cause to be delivered to, or permit to remain with, the Trustee or such paying agent, as the case may be, such Security Register, transfer
books or other records, or suitable copies or extracts therefrom, sufficient to enable the Trustee or such paying agent to give any notice
by mail that may be required under the provisions of this Section.
Section 3.3
Payment Upon Redemption.
(a) If the giving of
notice of redemption shall have been completed as above provided, the Securities or portions of Securities of the series to be redeemed
specified in such notice shall become due and payable on the date and at the place stated in such notice at the applicable redemption
price, together with interest accrued to the date fixed for redemption and interest on such Securities or portions of Securities shall
cease to accrue on and after the date fixed for redemption, unless the Company shall default in the payment of such redemption price and
accrued interest with respect to any such Security or portion thereof. On presentation and surrender of such Securities on or after the
date fixed for redemption at the place of payment specified in the notice, said Securities shall be paid and redeemed at the applicable
redemption price for such series, together with interest accrued thereon to the date fixed for redemption (but if the date fixed for redemption
is an interest payment date, the interest installment payable on such date shall be payable to the registered holder at the close of business
on the applicable record date pursuant to Section 2.03).
(b) Upon presentation
of any Security of such series that is to be redeemed in part only, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and the
office or agency where the Security is presented shall deliver to the holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a new Security of
the same series of authorized denominations in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the Security so presented.

Sinking Fund.
The provisions of Sections
3.04, 3.05 and 3.06 shall be applicable to any sinking fund for the retirement of Securities of a series, except as otherwise specified

The minimum amount of any
sinking fund payment provided for by the terms of Securities of any series is herein referred to as a “mandatory sinking fund payment,”
and any payment in excess of such minimum amount provided for by the terms of Securities of any series is herein referred to as an “optional
sinking fund payment”. If provided for by the terms of Securities of any series, the cash amount of any sinking fund payment may
be subject to reduction as provided in Section 3.05. Each sinking fund payment shall be applied to the redemption of Securities of
any series as provided for by the terms of Securities of such series.
Section 3.5 Satisfaction of
Sinking Fund Payments with Securities.
The Company (i) may
deliver Outstanding Securities of a series and (ii) may apply as a credit Securities of a series that have been redeemed either at
the election of the Company pursuant to the terms of such Securities or through the application of permitted optional sinking fund payments
pursuant to the terms of such Securities, in each case in satisfaction of all or any part of any sinking fund payment with respect to
the Securities of such series required to be made pursuant to the terms of such Securities as provided for by the terms of such series,
provided that such Securities have not been previously so credited. Such Securities shall be received and credited for such purpose by
the Trustee at the redemption price specified in such Securities for redemption through operation of the sinking fund and the amount of
such sinking fund payment shall be reduced accordingly.
Section 3.6 Redemption of Securities
for Sinking Fund.
Not less than 45 days prior
to each sinking fund payment date for any series of Securities (unless a shorter period shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), the Company
will deliver to the Trustee an Officer’s Certificate specifying the amount of the next ensuing sinking fund payment for that series
pursuant to the terms of the series, the portion thereof, if any, that is to be satisfied by delivering and crediting Securities of that
series pursuant to Section 3.05 and the basis for such credit and will, together with such Officer’s Certificate, deliver to
the Trustee any Securities to be so delivered. Not less than 30 days before each such sinking fund payment date the Trustee shall select
the Securities to be redeemed upon such sinking fund payment date in the manner specified in Section 3.02 and cause notice of the
redemption thereof to be given in the name of and at the expense of the Company in the manner provided in Section 3.02. Such notice
having been duly given, the redemption of such Securities shall be made upon the terms and in the manner stated in Section 3.03.

Section 4.2 Maintenance of Office or Agency.
So long as any series of
the Securities remain Outstanding, the Company agrees to maintain an office or agency with respect to each such series and at such other

for payment, (ii) Securities of that series may be presented as herein above authorized for registration of transfer and exchange,
and (iii) notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Securities of that series and this Indenture may be given

agent to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions
of this Section:
(i) that it will hold
all sums held by it as such agent for the payment of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on the Securities of that series
(whether such sums have been paid to it by the Company or by any other obligor of such Securities) in trust for the benefit of the Persons
entitled thereto;
(ii) that it will give
the Trustee notice of any failure by the Company (or by any other obligor of such Securities) to make any payment of the principal of
(and premium, if any) or interest on the Securities of that series when the same shall be due and payable;
(iii) that it will, at
any time during the continuance of any failure referred to in the preceding paragraph (a)(2) above, upon the written request of the
Trustee, forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums so held in trust by such paying agent; and
(iv) that it will perform
all other duties of paying agent as set forth in this Indenture.
(b) If the Company shall
act as its own paying agent with respect to any series of the Securities, it will on or before each due date of the principal of (and
premium, if any) or interest on Securities of that series, set aside, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled
thereto a sum sufficient to pay such principal (and premium, if any) or interest so becoming due on Securities of that series until such
sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as herein provided and will promptly notify the Trustee of such action, or
any failure (by it or any other obligor on such Securities) to take such action. Whenever the Company shall have one or more paying agents
for any series of Securities, it will, prior to each due date of the principal of (and premium, if any) or interest on any Securities
of that series, deposit with the paying agent a sum sufficient to pay the principal (and premium, if any) or interest so becoming due,

to the provisions of Section 11.05, and (ii) the Company may at any time, for the purpose of obtaining the satisfaction and
discharge of this Indenture or for any other purpose, pay, or direct any paying agent to pay, to the Trustee all sums held in trust by
the Company or such paying agent, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the same terms and conditions as those upon which such sums
were held by the Company or such paying agent; and, upon such payment by the Company or any paying agent to the Trustee, the Company or
such paying agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such money.

Vacancy in Office of Trustee.

with respect to Securities of a particular series, “Event of Default” means any one or more of the following events that has
occurred and is continuing:
(i) the Company defaults
in the payment of any installment of interest upon any of the Securities of that series, as and when the same shall become due and payable,
and such default continues for a period of ninety (90) days; provided, however, that a valid extension of an interest payment period by
the Company in accordance with the terms of any indenture supplemental hereto shall not constitute a default in the payment of interest

and payable whether at maturity, upon redemption, by declaration or otherwise, or in any payment required by any sinking or analogous
fund established with respect to that series; provided, however, that a valid extension of the maturity of such Securities in accordance
with the terms of any indenture supplemental hereto shall not constitute a default in the payment of principal or premium, if any;

to observe or perform any other of its covenants or agreements with respect to that series contained in this Indenture or otherwise established
with respect to that series of Securities pursuant to Section 2.01 hereof (other than a covenant or agreement that has been expressly
included in this Indenture solely for the benefit of one or more series of Securities other than such series) for a period of ninety (90)
days after the date on which written notice of such failure, requiring the same to be remedied and stating that such notice is a “Notice
of Default” hereunder, shall have been given to the Company by the Trustee, by registered or certified mail, or to the Company and
the Trustee by the holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the Securities of that series at the time Outstanding;

(b) In each and every
such case (other than an Event of Default specified in clause (4) or clause (5) above), unless the principal of all the Securities
of that series shall have already become due and payable, either the Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal
amount of the Securities of that series then Outstanding hereunder, by notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by
such Securityholders), may declare the principal of (and premium, if any, on) and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Securities of

to such series, other than the nonpayment of principal on (and premium, if any, on) and accrued and unpaid interest on Securities of that
series that shall not have become due by their terms, shall have been remedied or waived as provided in Section 6.06.

No such rescission and annulment
shall extend to or shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.
(d) In case the Trustee
shall have proceeded to enforce any right with respect to Securities of that series under this Indenture and such proceedings shall have
been discontinued or abandoned because of such rescission or annulment or for any other reason or shall have been determined adversely
to the Trustee, then and in every such case, subject to any determination in such proceedings, the Company and the Trustee shall be restored
respectively to their former positions and rights hereunder, and all rights, remedies and powers of the Company and the Trustee shall
continue as though no such proceedings had been taken.

required by any sinking or analogous fund established with respect to that series as and when the same shall have become due and payable,
and such default shall have continued for a period of ninety (90) days, or (ii) in case it shall default in the payment of the principal
of (or premium, if any, on) any of the Securities of a series when the same shall have become due and payable, whether upon maturity of
the Securities of a series or upon redemption or upon declaration or otherwise then, upon demand of the Trustee, the Company will pay
to the Trustee, for the benefit of the holders of the Securities of that series, the whole amount that then shall have been become due
and payable on all such Securities for principal (and premium, if any) or interest, or both, as the case may be, with interest upon the
overdue principal (and premium, if any) and (to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under applicable law) upon overdue
installments of interest at the rate per annum expressed in the Securities of that series; and, in addition thereto, such further amount
as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, and the amount payable to the Trustee under Section 7.06.
(b) If the Company shall
fail to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, shall be entitled
and empowered to institute any action or proceedings at law or in equity for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, and may prosecute
any such action or proceeding to judgment or final decree, and may enforce any such judgment or final decree against the Company or other
obligor upon the Securities of that series and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in the manner provided by law or equity
out of the property of the Company or other obligor upon the Securities of that series, wherever situated.
(c) In case of any receivership,

as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee and of the holders of Securities of such series allowed for
the entire amount due and payable by the Company under the Indenture at the date of institution of such proceedings and for any additional
amount that may become due and payable by the Company after such date, and to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable
or deliverable on any such claim, and to distribute the same after the deduction of the amount payable to the Trustee under Section 7.06;
and any receiver, assignee or trustee in bankruptcy or reorganization is hereby authorized by each of the holders of Securities of such
series to make such payments to the Trustee, and, in the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly
to such Securityholders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it under Section 7.06.
(d) All rights of action
and of asserting claims under this Indenture, or under any of the terms established with respect to Securities of that series, may be
enforced by the Trustee without the possession of any of such Securities, or the production thereof at any trial or other proceeding relative
thereto, and any such suit or proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and
any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for payment to the Trustee of any amounts due under Section 7.06, be for the ratable
benefit of the holders of the Securities of such series.
In case of an Event of Default
hereunder, the Trustee may in its discretion proceed to protect and enforce the rights vested in it by this Indenture by such appropriate
judicial proceedings as the Trustee shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any of such rights, either at law or in equity or
in bankruptcy or otherwise, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement contained in the Indenture or in aid of
the exercise of any power granted in this Indenture, or to enforce any other legal or equitable right vested in the Trustee by this Indenture

shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Securityholder any plan of reorganization,
arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities of that series or the rights of any holder thereof or to authorize the
Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Securityholder in any such proceeding.

the continuance thereof with respect to the Securities of such series specifying such Event of Default, as hereinbefore provided; (ii) the
holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of such series then Outstanding shall have made written request
upon the Trustee to institute such action, suit or proceeding in its own name as Trustee hereunder; (iii) such holder or holders

therein or thereby; (iv) the Trustee for ninety (90) days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity, shall
have failed to institute any such action, suit or proceeding and (v) during such ninety (90) day period, the holders of a majority

(b) No delay or omission
of the Trustee or of any holder of any of the Securities to exercise any right or power accruing upon any Event of Default occurring and

Section 6.6
Control by Securityholders.
The holders of a majority
in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any series at the time Outstanding, determined in accordance with Section 8.04,
shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising
any trust or power conferred on the Trustee with respect to such series; provided, however, that such direction shall not be in conflict
with any rule of law or with this Indenture. Subject to the provisions of Section 7.01, the Trustee shall have the right to
decline to follow any such direction if the Trustee in good faith shall, by a Responsible Officer or officers of the Trustee, determine
that the proceeding so directed, subject to the Trustee’s duties under the Trust Indenture Act, would involve the Trustee in personal
liability or might be unduly prejudicial to the Securityholders not involved in the proceeding. The holders of a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Securities of any series at the time Outstanding affected thereby, determined in accordance with Section 8.04,
may on behalf of the holders of all of the Securities of such series waive any past default in the performance of any of the covenants
contained herein or established pursuant to Section 2.01 with respect to such series and its consequences, except a default in the
payment of the principal of, or premium, if any, or interest on, any of the Securities of that series as and when the same shall become
due by the terms of such Securities otherwise than by acceleration (unless such default has been cured and a sum sufficient to pay all
matured installments of interest and principal and any premium has been deposited with the Trustee (in accordance with Section 6.01(c)).
Upon any such waiver, the default covered thereby shall be deemed to be cured for all purposes of this Indenture and the Company, the
Trustee and the holders of the Securities of such series shall be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder, respectively;
but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon.
Section 6.7 Undertaking to Pay
Costs.
All parties to this Indenture
agree, and each holder of any Securities by such holder’s acceptance thereof shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may
in its discretion require, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit against the Trustee
for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of
such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys’ fees, against any
party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; but
the provisions of this Section shall not apply to any suit instituted by the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Securityholder,
or group of Securityholders, holding more than 10% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities of any series, or to any
suit instituted by any Securityholder for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of (or premium, if any) or interest on any Security
of such series, on or after the respective due dates expressed in such Security or established pursuant to this Indenture.

use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent man would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct
of his own affairs.

this Indenture shall be construed to relieve the Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act,
or its own willful misconduct, except that:
(1) prior to the occurrence
of an Event of Default with respect to the Securities of a series and after the curing or waiving of all such Events of Default with respect
to that series that may have occurred: (A) the duties and obligations of the Trustee shall with respect to the Securities of such
series be determined solely by the express provisions of this Indenture, and the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to the Securities

covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee; and (B) in the absence of bad faith on the part of
the Trustee, the Trustee may with respect to the Securities of such series conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the
correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon any certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements
of this Indenture; but in the case of any such certificates or opinions that by any provision hereof are specifically required to be furnished
to the Trustee, the Trustee shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of
this Indenture;
(2) the Trustee shall
not be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer or Responsible Officers of the Trustee, unless it

of not less than a majority in principal amount of the Securities of any series at the time Outstanding relating to the time, method and
place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee
under this Indenture with respect to the Securities of that series; and
(4) none of the provisions
contained in this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur personal financial liability
in the performance of any of its duties or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers if there is reasonable ground for believing
that the repayment of such funds or liability is not reasonably assured to it under the terms of this Indenture or adequate indemnity
against such risk is not reasonably assured to it.

In addition, the Trustee
shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any Default or Event of Default except (1) any Event of Default occurring pursuant to Sections
6.01(a)(1) and 6.01(a)(2) or (2) any Default or Event of Default of which the Trustee shall have received written notification
in the manner set forth in this Indenture or a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have obtained actual knowledge. Delivery of reports,
information and documents to the Trustee under Section 5.03 is for informational purposes only and the information and the Trustee’s

Subject to the provisions
of Section 11.05, all moneys received by the Trustee shall, until used or applied as herein provided, be held in trust for the purposes

no liability for interest on any moneys received by it hereunder except such as it may agree with the Company to pay thereon.
Section 7.6 Compensation and Reimbursement.

and agrees to pay to the Trustee, and the Trustee shall be entitled to, such reasonable compensation (which shall not be limited by any

of such series, or any Securityholder of that series who has been a bona fide holder of a Security or Securities for at least six (6)
months may on behalf of himself and all others similarly situated, petition any such court for the appointment of a successor trustee.
Such court may thereupon after such notice, if any, as it may deem proper and prescribe, appoint a successor trustee.

become incapable of acting, or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent, or commence a voluntary bankruptcy proceeding, or a receiver
of the Trustee or of its property shall be appointed or consented to, or any public officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee
or of its property or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation; then, in any such case, the Company may
remove the Trustee with respect to all Securities and appoint a successor trustee by written instrument, in duplicate, executed by order
of the Board of Directors, one copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the Trustee so removed and one copy to the successor trustee,
or any Securityholder who has been a bona fide holder of a Security or Securities for at least six (6) months may, on behalf of that holder
and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of
a successor trustee. Such court may thereupon after such notice, if any, as it may deem proper and prescribe, remove the Trustee and appoint
a successor trustee.
(c) The holders of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of any series at the time Outstanding may at any time remove the Trustee with
respect to such series by so notifying the Trustee and the Company and may appoint a successor Trustee for such series with the consent

ARTICLE VIII
CONCERNING THE SECURITYHOLDERS
Section 8.1 Evidence
of Action by Securityholders
.
Whenever in this Indenture
it is provided that the holders of a majority or specified percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of a particular
series may take any action (including the making of any demand or request, the giving of any notice, consent or waiver or the taking of
any other action), the fact that at the time of taking any such action the holders of such majority or specified percentage of that series
have joined therein may be evidenced by any instrument or any number of instruments of similar tenor executed by such holders of Securities
of that series in person or by agent or proxy appointed in writing.
If the Company shall solicit
from the Securityholders of any series any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action, the Company
may, at its option, as evidenced by an Officer’s Certificate, fix in advance a record date for such series for the determination
of Securityholders entitled to give such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action, but the Company
shall have no obligation to do so. If such a record date is fixed, such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver
or other action may be given before or after the record date, but only the Securityholders of record at the close of business on the record
date shall be deemed to be Securityholders for the purposes of determining whether Securityholders of the requisite proportion of Outstanding
Securities of that series have authorized or agreed or consented to such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver
or other action, and for that purpose the Outstanding Securities of that series shall be computed as of the record date; provided, however,
that no such authorization, agreement or consent by such Securityholders on the record date shall be deemed effective unless it shall
become effective pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture not later than six months after the record date.
Section 8.2 Proof of Execution
by Securityholders.
Subject to the provisions
of Section 7.01, proof of the execution of any instrument by a Securityholder (such proof will not require notarization) or his agent
or proxy and proof of the holding by any Person of any of the Securities shall be sufficient if made in the following manner:
(a) The fact and date
of the execution by any such Person of any instrument may be proved in any reasonable manner acceptable to the Trustee.
(b) The ownership of
Securities shall be proved by the Security Register of such Securities or by a certificate of the Security Registrar thereof.
The Trustee may require such
additional proof of any matter referred to in this Section as it shall deem necessary.
-
22
-
Section 8.3 Who May be
Deemed Owners.
Prior to the due presentment
for registration of transfer of any Security, the Company, the Trustee, any paying agent and any Security Registrar may deem and treat
the Person in whose name such Security shall be registered upon the books of the Company as the absolute owner of such Security (whether
or not such Security shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notice of ownership or writing thereon made by anyone other than the Security
Registrar) for the purpose of receiving payment of or on account of the principal of, premium, if any, and (subject to Section 2.03)
interest on such Security and for all other purposes; and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any paying agent nor any Security Registrar
shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.
Section 8.4 Certain Securities
Owned by Company Disregarded.
In determining whether the
holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of Securities of a particular series have concurred in any direction, consent or waiver
under this Indenture, the Securities of that series that are owned by the Company or any other obligor on the Securities of that series
or by any Person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by or under common control with the Company or any other obligor on
the Securities of that series shall be disregarded and deemed not to be Outstanding for the purpose of any such determination, except
that for the purpose of determining whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such direction, consent or waiver, only Securities
of such series that the Trustee actually knows are so owned shall be so disregarded. The Securities so owned that have been pledged in
good faith may be regarded as Outstanding for the purposes of this Section, if the pledgee shall establish to the satisfaction of the
Trustee the pledgee’s right so to act with respect to such Securities and that the pledgee is not a Person directly or indirectly
controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the Company or any such other obligor. In case of a dispute
as to such right, any decision by the Trustee taken upon the advice of counsel shall be full protection to the Trustee.
Section 8.5 Actions Binding on Future Securityholders.
At any time prior to (but
not after) the evidencing to the Trustee, as provided in Section 8.01, of the taking of any action by the holders of the majority
or percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of a particular series specified in this Indenture in connection with such
action, any holder of a Security of that series that is shown by the evidence to be included in the Securities the holders of which have
consented to such action may, by filing written notice with the Trustee, and upon proof of holding as provided in Section 8.02, revoke
such action so far as concerns such Security. Except as aforesaid any such action taken by the holder of any Security shall be conclusive
and binding upon such holder and upon all future holders and owners of such Security, and of any Security issued in exchange therefor,
on registration of transfer thereof or in place thereof, irrespective of whether or not any notation in regard thereto is made upon such
Security. Any action taken by the holders of the majority or percentage in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of a particular
series specified in this Indenture in connection with such action shall be conclusively binding upon the Company, the Trustee and the
holders of all the Securities of that series.

provisions of the Trust Indenture Act as then in effect) for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating
any of the provisions of this Indenture or of any supplemental indenture or of modifying in any manner not covered by Section 9.01
the rights of the holders of the Securities of such series under this Indenture; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture
shall, without the consent of the holders of each Security then Outstanding and affected thereby, (a) extend the fixed maturity of
any Securities of any series, or reduce the principal amount thereof, or reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest thereon,
or reduce any premium payable upon the redemption thereof or (b) reduce the aforesaid percentage of Securities, the holders of which
are required to consent to any such supplemental indenture.
It shall not be necessary
for the consent of the Securityholders of any series affected thereby under this Section to approve the particular form of any proposed
supplemental indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve the substance thereof.
Section 9.3 Effect of Supplemental
Indentures.

accompanied by its Board Resolutions authorizing the execution of any such supplemental indenture, and upon the filing with the Trustee

execution of such supplemental indenture unless such supplemental indenture affects the Trustee’s own rights, duties or immunities
under this Indenture or otherwise, in which case the Trustee may in its discretion but shall not be obligated to enter into such supplemental
indenture. The Trustee, subject to the provisions of Section 7.01, may receive an Officer’s Certificate or, if requested, an
Opinion of Counsel as conclusive evidence that any supplemental indenture executed pursuant to this Article is authorized or permitted

same effect as if it had been named as the Company herein, and thereupon the predecessor corporation shall be relieved of all obligations
and covenants under this Indenture and the Securities.

consolidation, merger, sale, conveyance, transfer or other disposition, such changes in phraseology and form (but not in substance) may

property of any other Person (whether or not affiliated with the Company).
