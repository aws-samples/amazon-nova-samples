domestic or foreign branch or Affiliate of such Lender to make such Loan;

Letter of Credit
”), at any time and from time to time from the Effective Date until the
date that is one
25
Business Day prior to the Maturity Date. The Issuing Bank shall not be under any obligation to issue the Letter of Credit if any order, judgment or decree of any Governmental Authority or
arbitrator binding upon the Issuing Bank shall by its terms purport to enjoin or restrain the Issuing Bank from issuing the Letter of Credit, or any law, rule, regulation or orders of any Governmental Authority applicable to the Issuing Bank or any

issuance, amendment, renewal or extension (i) the aggregate LC Exposure shall not exceed the aggregate Commitments, and (ii) the Total Exposures shall not exceed the total Commitments. The Issuing Bank shall promptly (and in any event
within one Business Day) notify the Administrative Agent of each issuance, amendment, renewal, extension or expiry of the Letter of Credit, and shall provide to the Administrative Agent such other information as the Administrative Agent shall
reasonably request as to the Letter of Credit.

grants to each Lender, and each Lender hereby acquires from the Issuing Bank, a participation in the Letter of Credit equal to such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of the aggregate amount available to be drawn under the Letter of Credit. In
consideration and in furtherance of the foregoing, each Lender hereby absolutely and unconditionally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent, for the account of the Issuing Bank, such Lender’s Applicable Percentage of each LC Disbursement
made by the Issuing Bank and not reimbursed by the Company on the date due as provided in subsection (e) of this Section, or of any reimbursement payment required to be refunded to the Company for any reason. Each Lender
26
acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to acquire participations pursuant to this subsection in respect of the Letter of Credit is absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected by any
circumstance whatsoever, including any amendment, renewal or extension of the Letter of Credit or the occurrence and continuance of a Default or reduction or termination of the Commitments, and that each such payment shall be made without any
offset, abatement, withholding or reduction whatsoever.
(e)
Reimbursement
. If the
Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, the Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Company by telephone, facsimile or other telecommunication of the date and amount of such LC Disbursement. The Company shall be deemed to reimburse such LC
Disbursement, whether drawn before, on or, to the extent in accordance with applicable law, after the expiration date of the Letter of Credit, by the automatic making of an ABR Borrowing. The Administrative Agent shall notify each Lender of the
applicable LC Disbursement, the payment then due from the Company in respect thereof and such Lender’s Applicable Percentage thereof. Promptly following receipt of such notice, each Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent its Applicable
Percentage of the payment then due from the Company, and the Administrative Agent shall promptly pay to the Issuing Bank the amounts so received by it from the Lenders. Each Lender agrees to fund its Applicable Percentage of such payment due from
the Company on (i) the Business Day on which demand therefore is made by the Issuing Bank;
provided
, that notice of such demand is given not later than 11:00 a.m. (New York time) on such Business Day, or (ii) the first Business Day
next succeeding such demand if notice of such demand is given after such time. If and to the extent that any Lender shall not have made such amount available to the Administrative Agent, such Lender agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent
forthwith on demand such amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date of demand by the Issuing Bank until the date such amount is paid to the Administrative Agent, at the Federal Funds Effective Rate for its account or the
account of the Issuing Bank, as applicable. If such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent such amount for the account of the Issuing Bank on any Business Day, such amount so paid in respect of principal shall constitute an ABR Loan made by
such Lender on such Business Day for purposes of this Agreement.
(f)
Certain Liabilities
Relating to the Letter of Credit.
None of the Administrative Agent, the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, nor any of their respective Related Parties, shall have any liability or responsibility by reason of or in connection with the issuance or
transfer of the Letter of Credit or any payment or failure to make any payment thereunder (irrespective of any of the circumstances referred to in Section 2.08(f)), or any error, omission, interruption, loss or delay in transmission or delivery
of any draft, notice or other communication under or relating to the Letter of Credit (including any document required to make a drawing thereunder), any error in interpretation of technical terms or any consequence arising from causes beyond the
control of the Issuing Bank;
provided
that, without limiting Section 2.08(f), the foregoing shall not be construed to excuse the Issuing Bank from liability to the Company to the extent of any direct damages (as opposed to consequential
damages, claims in respect of which are hereby waived by the Company to the extent permitted by applicable law) suffered by the Company that are caused by the Issuing Bank’s failure to exercise care when determining whether drafts and other
documents presented under the Letter of Credit comply with the terms thereof. The parties hereto expressly agree that, in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Issuing Bank (as finally determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction), the Issuing Bank shall
27
be deemed to have exercised care in each such determination. In furtherance of the foregoing and without limiting the generality thereof, the parties agree that, with respect to documents
presented that appear on their face to be in substantial compliance with the terms of the Letter of Credit, the Issuing Bank may, in its sole discretion, either accept and make payment upon such documents without responsibility for further
investigation, regardless of any notice or information to the contrary (other than a valid injunction issued by a court of competent jurisdiction), or refuse to accept and make payment upon such documents if such documents are not in strict
compliance with the terms of the Letter of Credit.
(g)
Disbursement Procedures
. The
Issuing Bank shall, promptly following its receipt thereof, examine all documents purporting to represent a demand for payment under the Letter of Credit. The Issuing Bank shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent and the Company by telephone
(confirmed by telecopy) of such demand for payment and whether the Issuing Bank has made or will make an LC Disbursement thereunder;
provided
that any failure to give or delay in giving such notice shall not relieve the Company of its
obligation to reimburse the Issuing Bank and the Lenders with respect to any such LC Disbursement.
(h)
Interim Interest
. If the Issuing Bank shall make any LC Disbursement, then, unless the
Company shall reimburse (including the financing thereof by an ABR Borrowing) such LC Disbursement in full on the date such LC Disbursement is made, the unpaid amount thereof shall bear interest, for each day from and including the date such LC
Disbursement is made to but excluding the date that the Company reimburses (including the financing thereof by an ABR Borrowing) such LC Disbursement, at the rate per annum then applicable to ABR Loans;
provided
that, if the Company fails to
reimburse (including the financing thereof by an ABR Borrowing) such LC Disbursement when due pursuant to subsection (e) of this Section, then Section 2.11 shall apply. Interest accrued pursuant to this subsection shall be for the account
of the Issuing Bank, except that interest accrued on and after the date of payment by any Lender pursuant to subsection (e) of this Section to reimburse the Issuing Bank shall be for the account of such Lender to the extent of such payment.

Section 2.04(e), such transfers shall be made by (x) 12:00 Noon, New York City time in the case of Borrowings other than ABR Borrowings and (y) 2:00 p.m., New York City time in the case of ABR Borrowings on the date such Loan is

provided
that ABR Loans made to refinance the reimbursement of an LC Disbursement as provided in Section 2.04(e) shall be remitted by the Administrative Agent to the Issuing Bank.
(b)    Unless the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from a Lender prior to the proposed time of
any Borrowing that such Lender will not make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender’s share of such Borrowing, the Administrative Agent may
28
assume that such Lender has made such share available on such date in accordance with subsection (a) of this Section and may, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Company
a corresponding amount. In such event, if a Lender has not in fact made its share of the applicable Borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, then the applicable Lender and the Company severally agree to pay to the Administrative Agent
forthwith on demand such corresponding amount with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is made available to the Company to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at (i) in the case of
such Lender, the Federal Funds Effective Rate or (ii) in the case of the Company, the interest rate applicable to such Loan. If such Lender pays such amount to the Administrative Agent, then such amount shall constitute such Lender’s Loan
included in such Borrowing.
SECTION 2.06
Interest Elections
.
(a)    Each Borrowing initially shall be of the Type specified in the applicable Borrowing Request and, in
the case of a SOFR Borrowing, shall have an initial Interest Period as specified in such Borrowing Request. Thereafter, the Company may elect to convert such Borrowing to a different Type or to continue such Borrowing and, in the case of a SOFR

the Lenders holding the Loans comprising such Borrowing, and the Loans comprising each such portion shall be considered a separate Borrowing.
(b)    To make an election pursuant to this Section, the Company shall notify the Administrative Agent of
such election by telephone or email by the time that a Borrowing Request would be required under Section 2.03 if the Company were requesting a Borrowing of the Type resulting from such election to be made on the effective date of such election.
Each such telephonic or email Interest Election Request shall be irrevocable and shall be confirmed promptly by delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Interest Election Request in a form approved by the Administrative Agent
and signed by the Company.
(c)    Each telephonic and written Interest Election Request shall specify
the following information in compliance with Section 2.02:
(i)    the Borrowing to
which such Interest Election Request applies and, if different options are being elected with respect to different portions thereof, the portions thereof to be allocated to each resulting Borrowing (in which case the information to be specified
pursuant to clauses (iii) and (iv) below shall be specified for each resulting Borrowing);
(ii)    the effective date of the election made pursuant to such Interest Election Request,
which shall be a Business Day;
(iii)    whether the resulting Borrowing is to be an ABR
Borrowing or a SOFR Borrowing; and
29
(iv)    if the resulting Borrowing is a
SOFR Borrowing, the Interest Period to be applicable thereto after giving effect to such election, which shall be a period contemplated by the definition of the term “Interest Period”.
If any such Interest Election Request requests a SOFR Borrowing but does not specify an Interest Period, then the Company shall be deemed to
have selected an Interest Period of one month’s duration.
(d)    Promptly following receipt of an
Interest Election Request, the Administrative Agent shall advise each Lender of the details thereof and of such Lender’s portion of each resulting Borrowing.
(e)    If the Company fails to deliver a timely Interest Election Request with respect to a SOFR Borrowing
prior to the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto, then, unless such Borrowing is repaid as provided herein, at the end of such Interest Period such Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing. Notwithstanding any contrary provision
hereof, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent, at the request of the Required Lenders, so notifies the Company, then, so long as an Event of Default is continuing (i) no outstanding Borrowing may be
converted to or continued as a SOFR Borrowing and (ii) unless repaid, each SOFR Borrowing shall be converted to an ABR Borrowing at the end of the Interest Period applicable thereto.
SECTION 2.07

amount of the Commitments;
provided
that (i) each reduction of the Commitments shall be in an amount that is an integral multiple of $1,000,000 and not less than $5,000,000, (ii) the Company shall not terminate or reduce the
Commitments if, after giving effect to any concurrent prepayment of the Loans in accordance with Section 2.09, the sum of the Total Exposures of all the Lenders would exceed the total Commitments and (iii) the Company shall satisfy all its
obligations, if any, under Sections 2.14 and 9.03(a) and 9.03(b) in respect of such termination or reduction and any concurrent repayment.
(c)    The Company shall notify the Administrative Agent of any election to terminate or reduce the
Commitments under subsection (b) of this Section at least three Business Days (or such shorter period as agreed to by the Administrative Agent) prior to the effective date of such termination or reduction, specifying such election and the
effective date thereof. Promptly following receipt of any notice, the Administrative Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each reduction of the Commitments shall be made ratably among the Lenders based on their respective
Commitments. Schedule 2.01 shall be deemed amended to take into account any termination or reduction of the Commitments in accordance with this Section 2.07.

any sum received by the Administrative Agent hereunder for the account of the Lenders and each Lender’s share thereof.
(d)    The entries made in the accounts maintained pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this
Section shall, absent manifest error, be evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations recorded therein;
provided
that the failure of any Lender or the Administrative Agent to maintain such accounts or any error therein shall not
in any manner affect the obligation of the Company to repay the Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.
(e)    Any Lender may request that Loans made by it be evidenced by a promissory note. In such event, the
Company shall prepare, execute and deliver to such Lender a promissory note substantially in the form attached as Exhibit B (a “

non-application
or misapplication by the beneficiary the Letter of Credit of the proceeds of any drawing under the Letter of Credit; (vii) the fact that a Default shall
have occurred and be continuing; or (viii) any other event or circumstance whatsoever, whether or not
31
similar to any of the foregoing, that might, but for the provisions of this Section, constitute a legal or equitable discharge of, or provide a right of setoff against, the Company’s
obligations hereunder.
SECTION 2.09

the contents thereof. Each partial prepayment of any Borrowing shall be in an amount that would be permitted in the case of an advance of a Borrowing of the same Type as provided in Section 2.02. Subject to Section 2.18, each prepayment of
a Borrowing shall be applied ratably to the Loans included in the prepaid Borrowing. Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by Section 2.11.
(c)    Upon the designation of one or more “Successors” (as defined in and in accordance with the
provisions set forth in the 2014 ISDA Credit Derivatives Definitions, with the Company being the “Reference Entity” referred to in such term) to the Company under any credit derivative transaction entered into by Citibank, CUSA and/or
any of its Affiliates in order to mitigate credit risk arising out of the financing contemplated by this Agreement and to the extent the Lenders are not be satisfied, in their reasonable discretion, with their credit position, giving effect to any
arrangements that shall be made to address any concerns that they may have in regard to such designation of one or more “Successors” (as defined in and in accordance with the provisions set forth in the 2014 ISDA Credit Derivatives
Definitions, with the Company being the “Reference Entity” referred to in such term), then, immediately upon notice to such effect from the Administrative Agent, (i) the Company shall prepay all Borrowings hereunder, together with

LC Exposure as of such time, and (iv) any obligation of Citibank to issue further Credits (as defined in the Reimbursement Agreement) shall terminate. Such cash collateral shall be deposited in an account designated by the Issuing Bank at
Citibank. The Company shall be deemed to grant to the Issuing Bank a security interest in all its right, title and interest in and to such account to secure the payment and performance of Company’s obligations hereunder to the Issuing Bank.

SOFR Borrowing shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to the Term SOFR for the Interest Period in effect for such Borrowing plus the Lender Funding Supplement.
(c)    Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest on any Loan or any fee or other amount
payable by the Company hereunder is not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise, such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a rate per annum equal to (i) in the case of
overdue principal of any Loan, 2% plus the rate otherwise applicable to such Loan as provided above or (ii) in the case of any other amount, 2% plus the rate applicable to ABR Loans as provided above.
(d)    Accrued interest on each Loan shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment Date for such Loan;
provided
that (i) interest accrued pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section shall be payable on demand, (ii) in the event of any repayment or prepayment of any Loan (other than a prepayment of an ABR Loan prior to the end of
the Availability Period), accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment, (iii) in the event of any conversion of any SOFR Loan prior to the end of the current Interest
Period therefor, accrued interest on such Loan shall be payable on the effective date of such conversion and (iv) all accrued interest shall be payable upon termination of the Commitments.

with the use or administration of Term SOFR, the Administrative Agent will have the right to make Conforming Changes from time to time and, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Loan Document, any amendments implementing
such Conforming Changes will become effective without any further action or consent of any other party to this Agreement or any other Loan Document. The Administrative Agent will promptly notify the Borrower and the Lenders of the effectiveness of
any Conforming Changes in connection with the use or administration of Term SOFR.
SECTION 2.12
Alternate Rate of Interest
.
Subject to Section 2.19, if prior to the commencement of any Interest Period for a SOFR Borrowing:
(a)    the Administrative Agent determines (which determination shall be conclusive absent manifest error)
that adequate and reasonable means do not exist for ascertaining the Term SOFR for such Interest Period; or
(b)    the Administrative Agent is advised by the Required Lenders that because of a change in circumstances
affecting the applicable interbank market generally the Term SOFR for such Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such Lenders of making or maintaining their Loans included in such Borrowing for such Interest Period;
then the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to the Company and the Lenders by telephone or telecopy as promptly as practicable
thereafter and, until the Administrative Agent notifies the Company and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice no longer exist, (i) any Interest Election Request that requests the conversion of any Borrowing to, or
continuation of any Borrowing as, a SOFR Borrowing shall be ineffective, and (ii) if any Borrowing Request requests a SOFR Borrowing, such Borrowing shall be made as an ABR Borrowing;
provided
that if the circumstances giving rise to
such notice affect only one Type of Borrowings, then the other Type of Borrowings shall be permitted.
SECTION 2.13
Increased Costs
. Subject to Section 2.17,
(a)    If any Change in Law shall:
(i)    impose, modify or deem applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement
against assets of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by, any Lender (except any such reserve requirement contemplated by Section 2.13(f)); or
(ii)    subject any Recipient to any Taxes (other than (A) Indemnified Taxes,
(B) Taxes described in clauses (b) through (d) of the definition of Excluded Taxes and (C) Connection Income Taxes) on its loans, loan principal, commitments, or other obligations, or its deposits, reserves, other liabilities or
capital attributable thereto; or
(iii)    impose on any Lender or the Issuing Bank or
the applicable interbank market any other condition, cost or expense affecting this Agreement or SOFR Loans made by such Lender or the Letter of Credit or any participation therein;
34
and the result of any of the foregoing shall be to increase the cost to such Lender or the
Issuing Bank in an amount that such Lender or the Issuing Bank deems to be material of making or maintaining any SOFR Loan or of maintaining its obligation to make any such Loan, or to increase the cost to such Lender or the Issuing Bank of
participating in, issuing or maintaining the Letter of Credit or reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by such Lender or the Issuing Bank hereunder (whether of principal, interest or any other amount), then, upon request of such Lender
or the Issuing Bank, the Company will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, for such additional costs incurred or
reduction suffered.
(b)    If any Lender or the Issuing Bank determines that any Change in Law regarding
capital requirements, has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender’s or the Issuing Bank’s capital or on the capital of such Lender’s or the Issuing Bank’s holding company, if any, as a
consequence of this Agreement, the Commitments of such Lender or the Loans made by, or participations in the Letter of Credit held by, such Lender, or the Letter of Credit issued by the Issuing Bank, to a level below that which such Lender or the
Issuing Bank or such Lender’s or the Issuing Bank’s holding company could have achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender’s or the Issuing Bank’s policies and the policies of such
Lender’s or the Issuing Bank’s holding company with respect to capital adequacy), then from time to time the Company will pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such additional amount or amounts as will compensate
such Lender or the Issuing Bank or such Lender’s or the Issuing Bank’s holding company for any such reduction suffered.
(c)    A certificate of a Lender or the Issuing Bank setting forth the amount or amounts necessary to
compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank or the holding company of such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, as specified in subsections (a) or (b) of this Section 2.13 and explaining in reasonable detail the method by which
such amount or amounts shall have been determined, shall be delivered to the Company, shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Company shall pay to such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, the amount shown as due on any such
certificate within ten (10) days after receipt thereof.
(d)    Failure or delay on the part of any
Lender or the Issuing Bank to demand compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such Lender’s or the Issuing Bank’s right to demand such compensation;
provided
that the Company shall not be required to
compensate a Lender or the Issuing Bank pursuant to this Section for any increased costs incurred or reductions suffered unless the Lender or the Issuing Bank gives notice to the Company to compensate such Lender or the Issuing Bank pursuant to this
Section within one hundred and eighty (180) days after the date that such Lender or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, knows an event has occurred pursuant to which such Lender or the Issuing Bank will seek such compensation.
(e)    Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section, neither any Lender nor the Issuing Bank
shall be entitled to compensation pursuant to this Section if it is not at the time the general policy or practice of such Lender or the Issuing Bank to demand compensation in similar circumstances in similar credit agreements.

other than on the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto (including as a result of an Event of Default), (b) the conversion of any SOFR Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto, (c) the failure
to borrow, convert, continue or prepay any SOFR Loan on the date specified in any notice delivered pursuant hereto, or (d) the assignment of any SOFR Loan other than on the last day of the Interest Period applicable thereto as a result of a
request by the Company pursuant to Section 2.17, then, in any such event, the Company shall compensate each Lender for the actual loss, cost and expense attributable to such event. In the case of a SOFR Loan, the loss to any Lender attributable
to any such event (other than lost profits) shall be deemed to include an amount determined by such Lender to be equal to the excess, if any, of (i) the amount of interest that such Lender would pay for a deposit equal to the principal amount
of such Loan for the period from the date of such payment, conversion, failure or assignment to the last day of the then current Interest Period for such Loan (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or continue, the duration of the Interest
Period that would have resulted from such borrowing, conversion or continuation) if the interest rate payable on such deposit were equal to the Term SOFR for such Interest Period, over (ii) the amount of interest that such Lender would earn on
such principal amount for such period if such Lender were to invest such principal amount for such period at the interest rate that would be bid by such Lender (or an Affiliate of such Lender) for dollar deposits from other banks in the applicable
market at the commencement of such period. A certificate of any Lender setting forth any amount or amounts that such Lender is entitled to receive pursuant to this Section and explaining in reasonable detail the method by which such amount or
amounts shall have been determined shall be delivered to the Company and shall be conclusive absent manifest error;
provided
that neither any Lender nor the Issuing Bank shall be required to deliver information pursuant to this Section
relating to its business, other than any such information that is available to the Company on a
non-confidential
basis prior to the date of such certificate. The Company shall pay the amount shown as due on
any such certificate to the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender in accordance with Section 2.16 within ten (10) days after receipt of such certificate.
SECTION 2.15
Taxes

(a)
Payments Free of Taxes; Obligation to Withhold; Payments on Account of Taxes

(i)    Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the Company under any Loan
Document shall be made without deduction or withholding for any Taxes, except as required by applicable laws. If any applicable laws (as determined in the good faith discretion of an applicable Withholding Agent) require the deduction or withholding
of any Tax from any such payment by a Withholding Agent, then such Withholding Agent shall be entitled to make such deduction or withholding, upon the basis of the information and documentation to be delivered pursuant to paragraph (e) below.
(ii)    Without limiting Section 2.15(a)(i), if the Company or the Administrative
Agent shall be required by the Code to withhold or deduct any Taxes, including both United States federal backup withholding and withholding taxes, from any payment, then (A) the Administrative Agent shall withhold or make such deductions as
are determined by the Administrative Agent to be required based upon the information and
36
documentation it has received pursuant to paragraph (e) below, (B) the Administrative Agent shall timely pay the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in
accordance with the Code and (C) to the extent that the withholding or deduction is made on account of Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the Company shall be increased as necessary so that after any required withholding or the making of all
required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.15) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholding or deduction been made.
(iii)    If any Withholding Agent shall be required by any applicable laws other than the
Code to withhold or deduct any Taxes from any payment, then (A) such Withholding Agent, as required by such laws, shall withhold or make such deductions as are determined by it to be required based upon the information and documentation it has
received pursuant to
paragraph (e)
below, (B) such Withholding Agent, to the extent required by such laws, shall timely pay the full amount withheld or deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with such laws and
(C) to the extent that the withholding or deduction is made on account of Indemnified Taxes, the sum payable by the Company shall be increased as necessary so that after any required withholding or the making of all required deductions
(including deductions applicable to additional sums payable under this Section 2.15) the applicable Recipient receives an amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such withholding or deduction been made.
(b)
Payment of Other Taxes by the Company
. Without limiting the provisions of paragraph
(a) above, the Company shall timely pay to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable laws, or at the option of the Administrative Agent timely reimburse it for the payment of, any Other Taxes.

within ten days after demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes (including Indemnified Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable under this Section 2.15) payable or paid by such Recipient or required to
be withheld or deducted from a payment to such Recipient, and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the
relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to the Company by a Lender (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), or by the Administrative Agent on its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender,
shall be conclusive absent manifest error. The Company shall, and does hereby, indemnify the Administrative Agent, and shall make payment in respect thereof within ten (10) days after demand therefor, for any amount which a Lender for any
reason fails to pay indefeasibly to the Administrative Agent as required pursuant to Section 2.15(c)(ii) below;
provided
that the Company shall not be required to indemnify the Administrative Agent for any amount attributable to the
Administrative Agent’s gross negligence or willful misconduct.
37
(ii)    Each Lender shall, and does hereby,
severally indemnify, and shall make payment in respect thereof within ten (10) days after demand therefor, (x) the Administrative Agent against any Indemnified Taxes attributable to such Lender (but only to the extent that the Company has
not already indemnified the Administrative Agent for such Indemnified Taxes and without limiting the obligation of the Company to do so), (y) the Administrative Agent and the Company, as applicable, against any Taxes attributable to such
Lender’s failure to comply with the provisions of Section 9.04(d) relating to the maintenance of a Register and (z) the Administrative Agent and the Company, as applicable, against any Excluded Taxes attributable to such Lender that
are payable or paid by the Administrative Agent or the Company in connection with any Loan Document, and any reasonable expenses arising therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by
the relevant Governmental Authority. A certificate as to the amount of such payment or liability delivered to any Lender by the Administrative Agent shall be conclusive absent manifest error. Each Lender hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to
set off and apply any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender under this Agreement or any other Loan Document against any amount due to the Administrative Agent under this clause (ii).
(d)
Evidence of Payments
. As soon as practicable after any payment of Taxes by the Company to a
Governmental Authority as provided in this Section 2.15, the Company shall deliver to the Administrative Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of any return
required by laws to report such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

Agent, shall deliver such other documentation prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Company or the Administrative Agent as will enable the Company or the Administrative Agent to determine whether or not such Lender is subject
to backup withholding or information reporting requirements. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the preceding two sentences, the completion, execution and submission of such documentation (other than such documentation set forth in Sections
2.15(e)(ii)(A), 2.15(e)(ii)(B) and 2.15(e)(ii)(D) below) shall not be required if in the Lender’s reasonable judgment such completion, execution or submission would subject such Lender to any material unreimbursed cost or expense or would
materially prejudice the legal or commercial position of such Lender.

C-4
on behalf of each such direct and indirect partner;
C.    any Foreign Lender shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to do so, deliver to the

(f)
Treatment of Certain Refunds
. Unless required by applicable laws, at no time shall the
Administrative Agent have any obligation to file for or otherwise pursue on behalf of a Lender, or have any obligation to pay to any Lender, any refund of Taxes withheld or deducted from funds paid for the account of such Lender. If any Recipient
determines, in its sole discretion exercised in good faith, that it has received a refund of any Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Company or with respect to which the Company has paid additional amounts pursuant to this
Section 2.15, it shall pay to the Company an amount equal to such refund (but only to the extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Company under this Section 2.15 with respect to the Taxes giving rise to such
refund), net of all
out-of-pocket
expenses (including Taxes) incurred by such Recipient, and without interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental
Authority with respect to such refund),
provided
that the Company, upon the request of the Recipient, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the Company (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by the relevant Governmental
Authority) to the Recipient in the event the Recipient is required to repay such refund to such Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this subsection, in no event will the applicable Recipient be required to pay any
amount to the Company pursuant to this subsection the payment of which would place the Recipient in a less favorable net
after-Tax
position than such Recipient would have been in if the Tax subject to
indemnification and giving rise to such refund had not been deducted, withheld or otherwise imposed and the indemnification payments or additional amounts with respect to such Tax had never been paid. This subsection shall not be
40
construed to require any Recipient to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating to its taxes that it deems confidential) to the Company or any other Person.

or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date may, in the discretion of the Administrative Agent, be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes of
calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Administrative Agent to be credited to the Administrative Agent’s Account. All payments made by the Company to the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank as provided herein
or in any Note shall be deemed received by the Lenders or the Issuing Bank for all purposes as between the Lenders or the Issuing Bank and the Company. With respect to payments to be made to the Issuing Bank, the Administrative Agent will promptly
thereafter cause to be distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal, interest or Facility Fees to the Issuing Bank. Promptly after any such payment, the Issuing Bank or the Administrative Agent (as the case may be) will cause to be
distributed like funds relating to the payment of principal or interest or Facility Fees (other than amounts payable pursuant to Sections 2.04(f), 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 or 9.03) (according to the Lenders’ respective Commitments) to the Lenders
for the account of their respective lending offices, and like funds relating to the payment of any other amount payable to any Lender to the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent then shall cause like funds to be distributed to such
Lender for the account of its applicable lending office, in each case to be applied in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or any Note. The Administrative Agent shall distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other
Person to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. If any payment hereunder shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case of any
payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the period of such extension;
provided
,
however
, that in the event that the Maturity Date shall be on a day that is not a Business Day, any payment due on the Maturity
Date shall be due on the immediately preceding Business Day. All payments hereunder shall be made in dollars.
(b)    If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available to the Administrative Agent to pay
fully all amounts of principal, unreimbursed LC Disbursements, interest and fees then due hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, to pay interest and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance
with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and (ii) second, to pay principal and unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal and
unreimbursed LC Disbursements then due to such parties.
41
(c)    If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of
set-off
or counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or interest on any of its Loans or participations in unreimbursed LC Disbursements resulting in such Lender receiving payment of a
greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Loans or participations in unreimbursed LC Disbursements and accrued interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the Lender receiving such greater proportion shall
purchase (for cash at face value) participations in the Loans or participations in unreimbursed LC Disbursements of other Lenders to the extent necessary so that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in accordance
with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on their respective Loans or participations in unreimbursed LC Disbursements;
provided
that (i) if any such participations are purchased and all or any portion of the payment
giving rise thereto is recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the provisions of this subsection shall not be construed to apply to any payment
made by the Company pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Loans to any assignee or participant,
other than to the Company or any Subsidiary or Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this subsection shall apply). The Company consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent it may effectively do so under applicable law, that any
Lender acquiring a participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the Company rights of
set-off
and counterclaim with respect to such participation as fully as if such Lender were a
direct creditor of the Company in the amount of such participation.
(d)    Unless the Administrative
Agent shall have received notice from the Company prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank that the Company will not make such payment, the Administrative Agent may
assume that the Company has made such payment on such date in accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the Administrative Agent, whereupon the Administrative Agent shall distribute to the Lenders or the Issuing
Bank, as the case may be, the amount due. In such event, if the Company has not in fact made such payment, then each of the Lenders or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, severally agrees to repay to the Administrative Agent forthwith on demand
the amount so distributed to such Lender or the Issuing Bank with interest thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to it to but excluding the date of payment to the Administrative Agent, at the greater of the
Federal Funds Effective Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation.
(e)    If any Lender or the Issuing Bank shall fail to make any payment required to be made by it pursuant to
Section 2.04(d), 2.05(b) or 2.16(d), then the Administrative Agent may, in its discretion (notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof), apply any amounts thereafter received by the Administrative Agent for the account of such Lender or the
Issuing Bank to satisfy such Lender or the Issuing Bank’s obligations under such Sections until all such unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.

Section 2.13, or if the Company is required to pay any additional amount to any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant to Section 2.15, then such Lender shall (at the request of the Company) use
reasonable efforts to designate a different lending office for funding or booking its Loans hereunder or to assign its rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or affiliates, if, in the judgment of such Lender, such
designation or assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section 2.13 or 2.15, as the case may be, in the future, and (ii) would not subject such Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not
otherwise be disadvantageous to such Lender. The Company hereby agrees to pay all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such designation or assignment.
(b)    If (i) any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.13, (ii) the Company is required to
pay any additional amount to any Lender, the Issuing Bank or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender or the Issuing Bank pursuant to Section 2.15 and, in each case, such Lender has declined or is unable to designate a different
lending office in accordance with Section 2.17(a), (iii) if any Lender is a Defaulting Lender, or (iv) if in connection with any proposed amendment, modification, waiver or consent, the consent of the Required Lenders has been obtained but
the consent of a Lender the consent of which is required shall not have been obtained, then the Company may, at its sole expense and effort, upon notice to such Lender and the Administrative Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate, without
recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained in, and consents required by, Section 9.04), all of its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement and the related Loan Documents to an assignee that shall
assume such obligations (which assignee may be another Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment);
provided
that (i) [reserved]; (ii) such Lender shall have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its Loans
and participations in LC Disbursements, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable to it hereunder and under the other Loan Documents (including any amounts under Section 2.14) from the assignee (to the extent of such
outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the Company (in the case of all other amounts); and (iii) in the case of any such assignment resulting from a claim for compensation under Section 2.13 or payments required to be made
pursuant to Section 2.15, such assignment will result in a reduction in such compensation or payments thereafter. A Lender shall not be required to make any such assignment or delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a waiver by such Lender
or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Company to require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.
SECTION 2.18
Defaulting Lender

(a)
Adjustments
. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, if
any Lender becomes a Defaulting Lender, then, until such time as that Lender is no longer a Defaulting Lender, to the extent permitted by applicable law:

Defaulting Lender pursuant to Section 9.09), shall be applied at such time or times as may be determined by the Administrative Agent as follows:
first
, to the payment of any amounts owing by that Defaulting Lender to the Administrative
Agent hereunder;
second

required by this Agreement, as determined by the Administrative Agent;
third
, if so determined by the Administrative Agent and the Company, to be held in a
non-interest
bearing deposit account and
released in order to satisfy obligations of that Defaulting Lender to fund Loans under this Agreement;
fourth
, to the payment of any amounts owing to the Lenders and the Issuing Bank as a result of any judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction obtained by any Lender against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under this Agreement;
fifth
, so long as no Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
to the payment of any amounts owing to the Company as a result of any judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction obtained by the Company against that Defaulting Lender as a result of that Defaulting Lender’s breach of its obligations under
this Agreement; and
sixth

non-Defaulting

are applied (or held) to pay amounts owed by a Defaulting Lender pursuant to this Section 2.18(a)(ii) shall be deemed paid to and redirected by that Defaulting Lender, and each Lender irrevocably consents hereto.

Defaulting Lender and its Affiliates shall not be entitled to receive any Facility Fee payable pursuant to Section 2.10 during any period during which such Lender is a Defaulting Lender.
(b)

their sole discretion that a Lender that is a Defaulting Lender should no longer be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender, the Administrative Agent will so notify the parties hereto, whereupon as of the effective date specified in such notice and subject
to any conditions set forth therein, that Lender will, to the extent applicable, purchase that portion of outstanding Loans of the other Lenders or take such other actions as the Administrative Agent may determine to be necessary to cause the Loans

pro rata
basis by the Lenders in accordance with their Applicable Percentages, whereupon that Lender will cease to be a Defaulting Lender;
provided
, that, no adjustments will be made retroactively with respect to fees
accrued or payments made by or on behalf of the Company while that Lender was a Defaulting Lender;
provided
,
further
, that, except to the extent otherwise expressly agreed by the affected parties, no change hereunder from
44
Defaulting Lender to Lender will constitute a waiver or release of any claim of any party hereunder arising from that Lender having been a Defaulting Lender.

THE
ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT
Each of the Lenders and the Issuing Bank hereby irrevocably appoints the Administrative Agent
as its agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents and authorizes the Administrative Agent to take such actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Administrative Agent by the terms hereof or thereof, together
with such actions and powers as are reasonably incidental thereto.
Any bank serving as the Administrative Agent
hereunder shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as a Lender or the Issuing Bank as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the Administrative Agent and such bank and its Affiliates may accept deposits from,
lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries thereof or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Administrative Agent hereunder.
54
The Administrative Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except
those expressly set forth for the Administrative Agent herein and in the other Loan Documents. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (a) the Administrative Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other implied duties,
regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is continuing, (b) the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and powers expressly
contemplated hereby or by the other Loan Documents that the Administrative Agent is required to exercise in writing as directed by the Required Lenders, and (c) except as expressly set forth herein and in other Loan Documents, the
Administrative Agent shall have no duty to disclose, and shall not be liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the bank serving as the
Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The Administrative Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or percentage of the
Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section 9.02) to the extent required by Section 9.02 or in the absence of its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Administrative Agent shall not be
responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in connection with this Agreement or any other Loan Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate, report or other
document delivered hereunder or thereunder or in connection herewith or therewith, (iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or other terms or conditions set forth herein or therewith, (iv) the validity,
enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of this Agreement, any other Loan Document or any other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere herein, other than, in
the case of the Administrative Agent, to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the Administrative Agent.
The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any liability for relying upon, any notice,
request, certificate, consent, statement, instrument, document or other writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the proper Person. The Administrative Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it orally or by
telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and shall not incur any liability for relying thereon provided such reliance is made in good faith. Administrative Agent may consult with legal counsel (who may be counsel for the
Company), independent accountants and other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants or experts.
The Administrative Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers hereunder or under any other
Loan Document by or through any one or more subagents appointed by the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent and any such subagent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and powers through their respective Related
Parties. The exculpatory provisions of the preceding subsections shall apply to any such subagent and to the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent and any such subagent, and shall apply to their respective activities in connection with the
syndication of the credit facilities provided for herein as well as activities as the Administrative Agent.
Subject to
the appointment and acceptance of an appropriate successor Administrative Agent as provided in this subsection, the Administrative Agent may resign at any time by notifying the Lenders, the Issuing Bank and the Company. Upon any such resignation,
55
the Required Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the Company (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), to appoint a successor, which shall be a bank with an office in
New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank. If no such successor shall have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such appointment within 30 days after the retiring Administrative Agent gives
notice of its resignation, then the retiring Administrative Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint with the consent of the Company (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), a successor Administrative Agent, which shall be a bank with an
office in New York, New York, or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the acceptance of its appointment as an Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers,
privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Company to a successor Administrative Agent shall be the same as
those, if any, payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed between the Company and such successor. After the Administrative Agent’s resignation hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.03 shall continue in effect for
its benefit in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was acting as Administrative Agent.
Each Lender acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or
any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without reliance upon
the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any other Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking action under or based upon this
Agreement, any other Loan Document, any other Loan Document, any related agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

SECTION 9.02
Waivers; Amendments
.
(a)    No failure or delay by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender in exercising any
right or power hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or power, preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No
waiver of any provision of this Agreement or consent to any departure by the Company therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be effective only in the
specific
57
instance and for the purpose for which given. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.
(b)    Except as otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement (including Section 2.19), neither this
Agreement nor any provision hereof may be waived, amended or modified except pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered into by the Company and the Required Lenders and, if a majority of the Commitments, Loans or LC Exposure is held
by Defaulting Lenders, the Administrative Agent or by the Company and the Administrative Agent with the consent of the Required Lenders;
provided
that no such agreement shall (i) increase the Commitment of any Lender without the written
consent of such Lender, (ii) reduce the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement or reduce the rate of interest thereon (other than with respect to default interest), or reduce any fees payable hereunder, without the written consent of
each Lender affected thereby and the Issuing Bank, (iii) postpone the scheduled date of payment of the principal amount of any Loan or LC Disbursement, or any interest thereon, or any fees or any other amount payable hereunder, or reduce the
amount of, waive or excuse any such payment, or postpone the scheduled date of expiration of any Commitment, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby, (iv) change Section 2.16(b) or (c) in a manner that would alter
the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby without the written consent of each Lender, or (v) change any of the provisions of this Section or the definition of “Required Lenders” or any other provision hereof specifying the
number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, amend or modify any rights hereunder or make any determination or grant any consent hereunder without the written consent of each Lender;
provided
,
however
, no Defaulting Lender shall
have any right to approve or disapprove any amendment, waiver or consent hereunder (and any amendment, waiver or consent which by its terms requires the consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender may be effected with the consent of the
applicable Lenders other than Defaulting Lenders), except that (x) the Commitment of any Defaulting Lender may not be increased or extended without the consent of such Lender and (y) any waiver, amendment or modification requiring the
consent of all Lenders or each affected Lender that by its terms affects any Defaulting Lender more adversely than other affected Lenders shall require the consent of such Defaulting Lender; and
provided further
that (A) no such
agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent and (B) no amendment, modification or waiver of this Agreement or any
provision hereof that would alter the rights or duties of the Issuing Bank hereunder shall be effective without the written consent of the Issuing Bank.
(c)    Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the Administrative Agent and the Company may
amend, modify or supplement this Agreement or any other Loan Document to cure or correct administrative errors or omissions, any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency or to effect administrative changes, and such amendment shall become
effective without any further consent of any other party to such Loan Document so long as (i) such amendment, modification or supplement does not adversely affect the rights of any Lender in any material respect and (ii) the Lenders shall
have received at least five (5) Business Days’ prior written notice thereof and the Administrative Agent shall not have received, within five (5) Business Days of the date of such notice to the Lenders, a written notice from the
Required Lenders stating that the Required Lenders object to such amendment.
58
SECTION 9.03
Expenses; Indemnity; Damage
Waiver
.
(a)    The Company agrees to pay (i) all reasonable and documented
out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent and its Affiliates, including the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel for the Administrative
Agent, in connection with the preparation and administration of this Agreement or any amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions hereof (whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated) and
(ii) all reasonable and documented
out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender, including the reasonable fees,
charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank or any Lender, in connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights in connection with this Agreement, including its rights under this Section, or in

(b)    The Company agrees to indemnify the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and each Lender, and each
Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an “
Indemnitee
”) against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including
the reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by or asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a result of (i) the execution or delivery of this Agreement or any
agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the performance by the parties hereto of their respective obligations hereunder or the consummation of the Transactions or any other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any Loan or the Letter of
Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof (including any refusal by the Issuing Bank to honor a demand for payment under the Letter of Credit if the documents presented in connection with such demand do not strictly comply with the terms of the
Letter of Credit), (iii) any actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any property owned or operated by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries giving rise to liability under any Environmental Law, or any
Environmental Liability related in any way to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iv) any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or proceeding relating to any of the foregoing, whether based on contract, tort or any
other theory and regardless of whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto;
provided
that such indemnity shall not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or related expenses are
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee or its Affiliates or from a breach of this Agreement by such
Indemnitee. This Section 9.03(b) shall not apply with respect to Taxes other than any Taxes that represent losses, claims, damages, etc. arising from any
non-Tax
claim.
(c)    To the extent that the Company fails to pay any amount required to be paid by it to the Administrative
Agent or the Issuing Bank under subsection (a) or (b) of this Section, each Lender severally agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank, as the case may be, such Lender’s Applicable Percentage (determined as of the
time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity payment is sought) of such unpaid amount;
provided
that the unreimbursed expense or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case may be, was incurred by
or asserted against the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank in its capacity as such.
59
(d)    To the extent permitted by applicable law, no party
hereto shall assert, and each party hereto hereby waives, any claim against any other party, on any theory of liability, for special, consequential or punitive damages (as opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or
as a result of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the Transactions, any Loan, the Letter of Credit or the use of the proceeds thereof.
(e)    All amounts due under this Section shall be payable promptly after written demand therefore
accompanied by the appropriate invoice or other detail supporting such amount.
SECTION 9.04
Successors and Assigns
.
(a)    The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby, except that (i) the Company may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of
each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by the Company without such consent shall be null and void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights or obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section.
Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, Participants and
the Related Parties of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.
(b)    Any Lender may assign all or a portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including
all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans and participations in LC Disbursements at the time owing to it) to one or more Eligible Assignees with the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent, the Company (except in the case of an
assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender) and, in the case of any assignment of a Commitment, the Issuing Bank (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld);
provided
,
however
, that (i) the Company’s consent
shall not be required if either (x) an Event of Default or an “Event of Default” under (and as defined in) the Reimbursement Agreement has occurred and is continuing or (y) an ISDA Credit Event has occurred and such assignment
is made in connection with a settlement or delivery to a counterparty in connection with a credit default swap, and (ii) any assignment made by a Lender in one of the circumstances contemplated by clause (i) of this proviso may be an
assignment by such Lender of all or a portion of its rights and/or obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and/or the Loans and/or participations in LC Disbursements at the time owing to it (it being understood
and agreed that any partial assignment may be made as an assignment of all or part of the assigning Lender’s rights and/or obligations under this Agreement)). Except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender or an
assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender’s Commitments, (i) the amount of the Commitments of the assigning Lender subject to each such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Acceptance with
respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent) shall not be less than $5,000,000 and (ii) other than an assignment made in connection with a settlement or delivery to a counterparty in connection with a credit default swap
due to the occurrence of an ISDA Credit Event, each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, in each case, unless each of the Company
and the Administrative Agent otherwise
60
consent. The parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the Administrative Agent an Assignment and Acceptance, together (except in the case of an assignment by a Lender to one of its
Affiliates or an assignment as a result of any of the events contemplated by Section 2.17) with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500 (which may be waived by the Administrative Agent in its sole discretion), and the assignee, if it shall
not be a Lender, shall deliver to the Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire. Upon acceptance and recording pursuant to subsection (d) of this Section 9.04, from and after the effective date specified in each Assignment and
Acceptance, the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall,
to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Acceptance covering all of the assigning Lender’s rights and obligations
under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 and 9.03). Any assignment or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this
Agreement that does not comply with this subsection shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in accordance with subsection (e) of this Section. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no assignment shall be made to (i) a Defaulting Lender or any of its Subsidiaries, or any Person who, upon becoming a Lender hereunder, would constitute a Defaulting Lender, (ii) a natural person or (iii) the Company
and its Affiliates.
(c)    The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Company,
shall maintain at one of its offices in New York City a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitments of, and principal amount of the
Loans and LC Disbursements owing to, each Lender pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the “
Register
”). The entries in the Register shall be conclusive absent manifest error, and the Company, the Administrative
Agent, the Lenders and the Issuing Bank may treat each Person whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. In addition, the
Administrative Agent shall maintain on the Register information regarding the designation, and revocation of designation, of any Lender as a Defaulting Lender. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Company, the Issuing Bank, and any
Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior notice.
(d)    Upon its
receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Acceptance executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee permitted under subsection (b) of this Section, the assignee’s completed Administrative Questionnaire (unless the assignee shall already
be a Lender hereunder), the processing and recordation fee referred to in subsection (b) of this Section and any written consent to such assignment required by subsection (b) of this Section, the Administrative Agent shall accept such
Assignment and Acceptance and record the information contained therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this subsection.
(e)    Any Lender may, without the consent of any of the Company, the Administrative Agent or the Issuing
Bank, sell participations to (i) so long as no Event of Default or an “Event of Default” under, and as defined in, the Reimbursement Agreement has occurred and is continuing, one or more Eligible Assignees and (ii) in the event
that an Event of Default or
61
an “Event of Default” under, and as defined in, the Reimbursement Agreement has occurred and is continuing, to one or more banks or other entities (in each case, other than a natural
person, a Defaulting Lender or the Company or its Affiliates) (each a “
Participant
”) in all or a portion of such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and
the Loans owing to it);
provided
that (i) such Lender’s obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such
obligations, (iii) the Company, the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Bank and the other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender’s rights and obligations under this Agreement, and
(iv) the Company is notified of each participation sold to a Participant. Any agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce this Agreement and
to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement;
provided
that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment,
modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section 9.02(b) that affects such Participant. Subject to subsection (f) of this Section 9.04, the Company agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of
Sections 2.13, 2.14 and 2.15 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to subsection (b) of this Section. To the extent permitted by applicable law and provided the requirements of
this Section 9.04(e) are satisfied, each Participant also shall be entitled to the benefits of Section 9.09 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 2.15(f) and (g) as though it were a
Lender.
(f)    A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater payment under
Section 2.13 or 2.15 than the applicable Lender would have been entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant, unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the Company’s prior
written consent. A Participant that would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of Section 2.15 unless the requirements of Section 9.04(e) are satisfied.
(g)    Any Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any portion of its rights
under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender, including any such pledge or assignment to a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment of a security interest;
provided
that no such
pledge or assignment of a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or substitute any such assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.
(h)    In connection with any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder, no
such assignment shall be effective unless and until, in addition to the other conditions thereto set forth herein, the parties to the assignment shall make such additional payments to the Administrative Agent in an aggregate amount sufficient, upon
distribution thereof as appropriate (which may be outright payment, purchases by the assignee of participations or subparticipations, or other compensating actions, including funding, with the consent of the Company and the Administrative Agent, the
applicable pro rata share of Loans previously requested but not funded by the Defaulting Lender, to each of which the applicable assignee and assignor hereby irrevocably consent), to (x) pay and satisfy in full all payment liabilities then owed
by such Defaulting Lender to the Administrative Agent or any Lender hereunder (and interest accrued thereon) and (y) acquire (and fund as appropriate) its full pro rata
62
share of all Loans in accordance with its Applicable Percentage. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any assignment of rights and obligations of any Defaulting Lender hereunder shall
become effective under applicable law without compliance with the provisions of this paragraph (h), then the assignee of such interest shall be deemed to be a Defaulting Lender for all purposes of this Agreement until such compliance occurs.
SECTION 9.05
Survival
.
All covenants, agreements, representations and warranties made by the Company herein and in the certificates or other
instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the occurrence of any Credit Event,
regardless of any investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Administrative Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at the time any
credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid and so long as the
Commitments have not expired or terminated. The provisions of Sections 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 and 9.03 shall survive and remain in full force and effect regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the repayment of the
Loans, the expiration or termination of the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision hereof.
SECTION 9.06
USA Patriot Act
.
Each Lender hereby notifies the Company that pursuant to the requirements of the USA Patriot Act, it is required to obtain,
verify and record information that identifies the Company, which information includes the name and address of the Company and other information that will allow such Lender to identify the Company in accordance with its requirements.
SECTION 9.07
Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness
.
This Agreement may be executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different counterparts), each of which
shall constitute an original, but all of which when taken together shall constitute a single contract. This Agreement, the Letter of Credit, the Reimbursement Agreement, the Fee Letter and any other separate letter agreements with respect to fees
payable to the Administrative Agent constitute the entire contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to the subject matter hereof.
Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become effective when it shall have been executed by the Administrative Agent and when the Administrative Agent shall have received counterparts hereof which, when taken together, bear
the signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page of this
Agreement by telecopy or other electronic transmission shall be effective as delivery of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement. The words “execution,” “signed,” “signature,” and words of like import in
this Agreement shall be deemed to include electronic signatures or the keeping of records in electronic form, each of which shall be of the same legal effect, validity or enforceability as a manually
63
executed signature or the use of a paper-based recordkeeping system, as the case may be, to the extent and as provided for in any applicable law, including the Federal Electronic Signatures in
Global and National Commerce Act, the New York State Electronic Signatures and Records Act, or any other similar state laws based on the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act.
SECTION 9.08
Severability
.
Any provision of this Agreement held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in a
particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other jurisdiction. Without limiting the foregoing provisions of this Section 9.08, if and to the extent that the enforceability of any provisions in this Agreement relating to
Defaulting Lenders shall be limited by Debtor Relief Laws, as determined in good faith by the Administrative Agent, then such provisions shall be deemed to be in effect only to the extent not so limited.
SECTION 9.09
Right of Setoff
.
If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, each Lender is hereby authorized at any time and from time to
time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final) at any time held and other indebtedness at any time owing by such Lender to or for the credit or the
account of the Company against any of and all the obligations of the Company now or hereafter existing under this Agreement or any other Loan Document held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such Lender shall have made any demand under
this Agreement or any other Loan Document and although such obligations may be unmatured;
provided
, that, in the event that any Defaulting Lender shall exercise any such right of setoff, (x) all amounts so set off shall be paid over
immediately to the Administrative Agent for further application in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.18 and, pending such payment, shall be segregated by such Defaulting Lender from its other funds and deemed held in trust for the
benefit of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and (y) the Defaulting Lender shall provide promptly to the Administrative Agent a statement describing in reasonable detail the Obligations owing to such Defaulting Lender as to which it
exercised such right of setoff. The rights of each Lender under this Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which such Lender may have. Any Lender exercising any of its rights pursuant to this Section
shall provide notice of the same to the Company promptly after exercising the same;
provided
,
however
, the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such setoff.
SECTION 9.10

and governed by the law of the State of New York.

this Agreement or in any other Loan Document shall affect any right that the Administrative Agent or any Lender or the Issuing Bank may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Loan Document against
the Company or its properties in the courts of any jurisdiction.
(c)    The Company hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any
other Loan Document in any court referred to in subsection (b) of this Section. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action
or proceeding in any such court.
(d)    The Company and each other party to this Agreement irrevocably
consent to service of process in the manner provided for notices to it in Section 9.01. Nothing in this Agreement will affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.
SECTION 9.11
WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL

.
65
Each of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders and the Issuing Bank
agrees to maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that Information may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates’ directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal counsel and
other advisors (it being understood that the Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information confidential) on a “need to know” basis solely
in connection with the Transactions, (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority,
provided
,
however
, that, to the extent legally permitted, the Company is promptly notified in order that it may seek a protective order
or take other appropriate action, (c) to the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or similar legal process;
provided
,
however

in order that it may seek a protective order or take other appropriate action, (d) to any other party to this Agreement, (e) to the extent reasonably required or reasonably deemed advisable in connection with the exercise of any remedies
hereunder or any suit, action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of rights hereunder, (f) subject to an agreement containing provisions substantially the same as those of this Section, to (i) any assignee of or
Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in, any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement or (ii) any actual or prospective counterparty (or its advisors) to any securitization, swap or derivatives transaction
relating to the Company, any Subsidiaries and the obligations hereunder, (g) with the consent of the Company, (h) to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available other than as a result of a breach of this Section or
(ii) becomes available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the Company, or (i) with advance notice to the Company (which notice shall be delivered to the Company
at least two Business Days in advance to the extent practicable), (A) to the Determinations Committee to the extent the Administrative Agent or the Issuing Bank reasonably believes such information is necessary for the Determinations Committee to
properly adjudicate whether a “Bankruptcy” (as defined in Section 4.2 of the 2014 Credit Derivatives Definitions) or a “Failure to Pay” (as defined in Section 4.5 of the 2014 Credit Derivatives Definitions), taking
into account Section 4.1 of the 2014 Credit Derivatives Definitions, with respect to the Company as the “Reference Entity” has occurred with respect to the Company or whether a Loan constitutes a “Deliverable Obligation”
(as defined in the 2014 Credit Derivatives Definitions) in connection with a credit default swap auction or (B) to any counterparty (or its advisors) to any securitization, swap or derivatives transaction relating to the Company, any
Subsidiaries of the Company and the obligations hereunder (it being agreed that any such disclosure pursuant to clause (A) or (B) of this clause (i) may be made in a manner that causes such information to become “Publicly Available
Information” (as defined in the 2014 Credit Derivatives Definitions)). For the purposes of this Section, “
Information
” means all information received from the Company in connection with this Agreement relating to the
Company or its business, other than any such information that is available to the Administrative Agent, any Lender or the Issuing Bank on a nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Company;
provided
that, in the case of information
received from the Company after the date hereof, such information is clearly identified as confidential at the time of delivery or delivered under circumstances that would cause a reasonable person to believe such information to be confidential. Any
Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such
Information as such Person would accord to its own confidential information. For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in
66
this Section shall prohibit any Person from voluntarily disclosing or providing any Information to any governmental, regulatory or self-regulatory organization (each, a “
Regulatory
Authority
”) without notification to any Person, to the extent that any such prohibition on disclosure shall be prohibited by the laws or regulations applicable to such Regulatory Authority that are applicable to such Person.
SECTION 9.14
Interest Rate Limitation
.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to any Loan, together with all
fees, charges and other amounts which are treated as interest on such Loan under applicable law (collectively the “
Charges
”), shall exceed the maximum lawful rate (the “
Maximum Rate
”) which may be
contracted for, charged, taken, received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan in accordance with applicable law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Loan hereunder, together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be
limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges that would have been payable in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a result of the operation of this Section shall be cumulated and the interest and Charges
payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be increased (but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount, together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate to the date of repayment, shall
have been received by such Lender.
SECTION 9.15
Acknowledgement and Consent to
Bail-In
of Affected Financial Institutions
. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Loan Document or in any other agreement, arrangement or understanding among any such parties, each party hereto
acknowledges that any liability of any Affected Financial Institution arising under any Loan Document, to the extent such liability is unsecured, may be subject to the Write-Down and Conversion Powers of the applicable Resolution Authority and
agrees and consents to, and acknowledges and agrees to be bound by:(a) the application of any Write-Down and Conversion Powers by the applicable Resolution Authority to any such liabilities arising hereunder which may be payable to it by any party
hereto that is an Affected Financial Institution; and
(b)    the effects of any
Bail-In
Action on any such liability, including, if applicable:
(i)    a reduction in full or in part or cancellation of any such liability;
(ii)    a conversion of all, or a portion of, such liability into shares or other instruments
of ownership in such Affected Financial Institution, its parent undertaking, or a bridge institution that may be issued to it or otherwise conferred on it, and that such shares or other instruments of ownership will be accepted by it in lieu of any
rights with respect to any such liability under this Agreement or any other Loan Document; or
(iii)    the variation of the terms of such liability in connection with the exercise of the
Write-Down and Conversion Powers of the applicable Resolution Authority.
SECTION 9.16
Anti-Boycott
Regulations.
67
The representations and warranties provided for in Section 3.08 shall
only apply to the Company and its respective Subsidiaries which are bound by any Anti-Boycott Regulations insofar as the giving thereof and compliance therewith do not and will not result in a violation of or conflict with or liability under any
Anti-Boycott Regulations.
SECTION 9.17
Erroneous Payments.
(a)    If the Administrative Agent notifies a Lender, the Issuing Bank or any Person who has received funds
on behalf of a Lender or the Issuing Bank (any such Lender, the Issuing Bank or other recipient, a “
Payment Recipient
”) that the Administrative Agent has determined in its sole discretion (whether or not after receipt of
any notice under immediately succeeding clause (b)) that any funds received by such Payment Recipient from the Administrative Agent or any of its Affiliates were erroneously transmitted to, or otherwise erroneously or mistakenly received by, such
Payment Recipient (whether or not known to such Lender, the Issuing Bank or other Payment Recipient on its behalf) (any such funds, whether received as a payment, prepayment or repayment of principal, interest, fees, distribution or otherwise,
individually and collectively, an “
Erroneous Payment
”) and demands the return of such Erroneous Payment (or a portion thereof), such Erroneous Payment shall at all times remain the property of the Administrative Agent and
shall be segregated by the Payment Recipient and held in trust for the benefit of the Administrative Agent, and such Lender or the Issuing Bank shall (or, with respect to any Payment Recipient who received such funds on its behalf, shall cause such
Payment Recipient to) promptly, but in no event later than two Business Days thereafter, return to the Administrative Agent the amount of any such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) as to which such a demand was made, in same day funds (in the
currency so received), together with interest thereon in respect of each day from and including the date such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) was received by such Payment Recipient to the date such amount is repaid to the Administrative Agent
in same day funds at the greater of the Overnight Rate and a rate determined by the Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rules on interbank compensation from time to time in effect. A notice of the Administrative Agent to any
Payment Recipient under this clause (a) shall be conclusive, absent manifest error.
(b)    Without
limiting immediately preceding clause (a), each Lender or the Issuing Bank or any Person who has received funds on behalf of a Lender or the Issuing Bank hereby further agrees that if it receives a payment, prepayment or repayment (whether received
as a payment, prepayment or repayment of principal, interest, fees, distribution or otherwise) from the Administrative Agent (or any of its Affiliates) (x) that is in a different amount than, or on a different date from, that specified in a
notice of payment, prepayment or repayment sent by the Administrative Agent (or any of its Affiliates) with respect to such payment, prepayment or repayment, (y) that was not preceded or accompanied by a notice of payment, prepayment or
repayment sent by the Administrative Agent (or any of its Affiliates), or (z) that such Lender or the Issuing Bank, or other such recipient, otherwise becomes aware was transmitted, or received, in error or by mistake (in whole or in part) in
each case:
(i)    (A) in the case of immediately preceding clauses (x) or (y), an
error shall be presumed to have been made (absent written confirmation from the Administrative Agent to the contrary) or (B) an error has been made (in the case of immediately preceding clause (z)), in each case, with respect to such payment,
prepayment or repayment; and
68
(ii)    such Lender or the Issuing Bank
shall (and shall cause any other recipient that receives funds on its respective behalf to) promptly (and, in all events, within one Business Day of its knowledge of such error) notify the Administrative Agent of its receipt of such payment,
prepayment or repayment, the details thereof (in reasonable detail) and that it is so notifying the Administrative Agent pursuant to this Section 9.17(b).
(c)    Each Lender and the Issuing Bank hereby authorizes the Administrative Agent to set off, net and apply
any and all amounts at any time owing to such Lender or the Issuing Bank under any Loan Document, or otherwise payable or distributable by the Administrative Agent to such Lender or the Issuing Bank from any source, against any amount due to the
Administrative Agent under immediately preceding clause (a) or under the indemnification provisions of this Agreement.
(d)    In the event that an Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) is not recovered by the Administrative
Agent for any reason, after demand therefor by the Administrative Agent in accordance with immediately preceding clause (a), from any Lender or the Issuing Bank that has received such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) (and/or from any Payment
Recipient who received such Erroneous Payment (or portion thereof) on its respective behalf) (such unrecovered amount, an “
Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency
”), upon the Administrative Agent’s notice to such Lender
or the Issuing Bank at any time, (i) such Lender or the Issuing Bank shall be deemed to have assigned its Loans (but not its Commitments) with respect to which such Erroneous Payment was made in an amount equal to the Erroneous Payment Return
Deficiency (or such lesser amount as the Administrative Agent may specify) (such assignment of the Loans (but not Commitments), the “
Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment
”) at par plus any accrued and unpaid interest
(with the assignment fee to be waived by the Administrative Agent in such instance), and is hereby (together with the Borrower) deemed to execute and deliver an Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment,
and such Lender or the Issuing Bank shall deliver any promissory notes evidencing such Loans to the Borrower or the Administrative Agent, (ii) the Administrative Agent as the assignee Lender shall be deemed to acquire the Erroneous Payment
Deficiency Assignment, (iii) upon such deemed acquisition, the Administrative Agent as the assignee Lender shall become a Lender or the Issuing Bank, as applicable, hereunder with respect to such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment and the
assigning Lender or assigning Issuing Bank shall cease to be a Lender or the Issuing Bank, as applicable, hereunder with respect to such Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, its obligations under the
indemnification provisions of this Agreement and its applicable Commitments which shall survive as to such assigning Lender or assigning Issuing Bank and (iv) the Administrative Agent may reflect in the Register its ownership interest in the
Loans subject to the Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment. The Administrative Agent may, in its discretion, sell any Loans acquired pursuant to an Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment and upon receipt of the proceeds of such sale, the
Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency owing by the applicable Lender or the Issuing Bank shall be reduced by the net proceeds of the sale of such Loan (or portion thereof), and the Administrative Agent shall retain all other rights, remedies and
claims against such Lender or the Issuing Bank (and/or against any recipient that receives funds on its respective behalf). For the avoidance of doubt, no Erroneous
69
Payment Deficiency Assignment will reduce the Commitments of any Lender or the Issuing Bank and such Commitments shall remain available in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. In
addition, each party hereto agrees that, except to the extent that the Administrative Agent has sold a Loan (or portion thereof) acquired pursuant to an Erroneous Payment Deficiency Assignment, and irrespective of whether the Administrative Agent
may be equitably subrogated, the Administrative Agent shall be contractually subrogated to all the rights and interests of the applicable Lender or the Issuing Bank under the Loan Documents with respect to each Erroneous Payment Return Deficiency.
(e)    The parties hereto agree that an Erroneous Payment shall not pay, prepay, repay, discharge or
otherwise satisfy any obligations owed by the Borrower, except, in each case, to the extent such Erroneous Payment is, and solely with respect to the amount of such Erroneous Payment that is, comprised of funds received by the Administrative Agent
from the Borrower or any of their respective Affiliates for the purpose of making such Erroneous Payment.
(f)    To the extent permitted by applicable law, no Payment Recipient shall assert any right or claim to an
Erroneous Payment, and hereby waives, and is deemed to waive, any claim, counterclaim, defense or right of
set-off
or recoupment with respect to any demand, claim or counterclaim by the Administrative Agent
for the return of any Erroneous Payment received, including without limitation waiver of any defense based on “discharge for value” or any similar doctrine.
(g)    Each party’s obligations, agreements and waivers under this Section 9.17 shall survive the
resignation or replacement of the Administrative Agent, any transfer of rights or obligations by, or the replacement of, a Lender or the Issuing Bank, the termination of the Commitments and/or the repayment, satisfaction or discharge of all
obligations hereunder (or any portion thereof) under any Loan Document.
