    "# Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning(PEFT LoRA) of Amazon Nova using Amazon SageMaker Training Job\n",
    "\n",
    "You can customize Amazon Nova models through base recipes using Amazon SageMaker training jobs. These recipes support Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), with both Full-Rank and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) options.\n",
    "\n",
    "The end-to-end customization workflow involves stages like model training, model evaluation, and deployment for inference. This model customization approach on SageMaker AI provides greater flexibility and control to fine-tune its supported Amazon Nova models, optimize hyperparameters with precision, and implement techniques including LoRA Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), Full-Rank Supervised Fine-Tuning, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of Amazon Nova using Amazon SageMaker Training Job. SFT is a technique that allows fine-tuning language models on specific tasks using labeled examples, while PEFT enables efficient fine-tuning by updating only a small subset of the model's parameters.\n",

    "\n",
    "> _**Note:** This notebook demonstrates fine-tuning using Nova Lite, but the same techniques can be applied to Nova Pro or Nova Micro models with appropriate adjustments to the configuration._\n"

    "### Low-rank adapter fine tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The most effective and cost-efficient method to enhance the base model performance is through the utilization of Low Rank Adapter (LoRA) fine-tuning. The underlying principle of LoRA is that only a small number of additional weights requires updating to adapt it to new tasks or domains. LoRA efficiently fine-tunes large language models by introducing low-rank trainable weight matrices into specific model layers, reducing the number of trainable parameters while maintaining model quality. A LoRA adapter augments the base foundation model by incorporating lightweight adapter layers that modify the model’s weights during inference, while keeping the original model parameters frozen. This approach is also considered one of the most cost-effective fine-tuning techniques. For more information, see Fine-tune models with adapter inference components\n",
    "\n",
    "In what cases is Low-rank Adapter Fine tuning recommended?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Developers are recommended to generally start with Low-rank Adapter Fine tuning due to its fast training procedure.\n",
    "* It is recommended to use Low-rank Adapter (LoRA) fine-tuning in cases where the base model performance is already satisfactory, and the goal is to enhance the model's capabilities across multiple related tasks, such as text summarization and language translation. LoRA's regularization properties help prevent over-fitting and mitigate the \"forgetting\" of the source domain, ensuring the model remains versatile and adaptable to various applications.\n",
    "* Consider using LoRA for instruction fine-tuning (IFT) scenarios with relatively small datasets. LoRA performs better with smaller, task-specific datasets than broader larger datasets.\n",
    "* It is recommended to leverage Low-rank Adapter (LoRA) fine-tuning on Amazon SageMaker AI when the developer has a larger labeled dataset that exceeds the Bedrock Customization Data Limits.\n",
    "* Additionally, LoRA on SageMaker AI is recommended when the developer has already achieved promising results through Bedrock Customization, and seeks to further optimize hyper-parameters.\n",
