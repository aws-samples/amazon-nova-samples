    "# RFT Evaluation with Custom Reward Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to evaluate Amazon Nova models using **Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) evaluation** with custom reward functions. In this specific example, we will be using an **AWS Lambda function** which will be hosting a custom-coded reward function to evaluate a model on its ability to solve **algebraic equations**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note - Lambda is one of two potential infrastructrue solutions that Nova RFT evaluation can support. The other workflow is \"Bring Your Own Orchestrator\" which uses the [Verifers](https://github.com/tang-ti/verifiers/tree/main) open source library to allow for custom environments and should be used for more complex use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use Lambda-based RFT evaluation:**\n",
    "- Single-turn tasks with custom scoring logic\n",
    "- Reward computation completes within 15 minutes\n",
    "- You want AWS to handle the orchestration infrastructure\n",
    "\n",
    "**When to use BYOO (Bring Your Own Orchestrator) RFT evaluation:**\n",
    "- Multi-turn agent scenarios (e.g., coding agents that iteratively debug across multiple interactions)\n",
    "- Complex reward calculations that exceed 15-minute Lambda timeout\n",
    "- Custom orchestration logic for simulating realistic environments\n",
    "- Tasks requiring stateful interactions between model and environment\n",
    "- Full control over the rollout generation process and conversation flow\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Case Example: Math Problem Solving**\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll evaluate a Nova model on solving algebraic equations. The Lambda function will:\n",
    "- Parse the model's JSON response to extract the answer\n",
    "- Compare it against the ground truth\n",
    "- Return a binary reward (1.0 for correct, 0.0 for incorrect)\n",
    "- Track additional metrics like format compliance\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recipe we will be using for this example**\n",

    "- **reasoning_effort**: This can be set to either null, low, or high. This value will modify the amount of tokens the Nova 2 lite model will use during its reasoning.\n",
    "- **top_logprobs**: The amount of tokens that will have logprobs shown during the output. These values can be found in the output parquet file. This can be useful for analyzing the model behavior.\n",
    "- **max_new_tokens**: The amount of tokens that the model will generate before stopping. For this specific example, we can have a relatively low number because we expect the model to just print out the answers to simple math questions!\n",
