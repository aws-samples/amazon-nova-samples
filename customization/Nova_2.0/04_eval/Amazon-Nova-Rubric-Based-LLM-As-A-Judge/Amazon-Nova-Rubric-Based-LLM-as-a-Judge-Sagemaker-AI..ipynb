    "# Amazon Nova Rubric Based LLM-as-a-Judge Evaluation with Amazon SageMaker\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to use Amazon Nova's rubric-based LLM-as-a-Judge methodology to evaluate and compare the outputs of two different large language models using Amazon SageMaker Training Jobs. We'll compare responses from a **Qwen2.5 1.5B Instruct model (Model A)** against a **Qwen2.5 7B Instruct model (Model B)**, both deployed on SageMaker AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "The Amazon Nova rubric-based LLM-as-a-Judge approach uses a powerful language model to evaluate the quality of responses from other models by dynamically generating custom evaluation rubrics for each comparison. This method provides:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective Comparison**: Systematic evaluation using automatically generated, context-specific rubrics with weighted criteria (accuracy, completeness, clarity, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scalable Assessment**: Automated rubric generation and criterion-based scoring across large datasets without manual rubric design\n",
    "\n",
    "**Detailed Metrics**: Win rates, confidence intervals, preference distributions, weighted scores per criterion, and detailed justifications for each evaluation dimension\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cost-Effective**: More efficient than human evaluation for large-scale comparisons while maintaining evaluation transparency through explicit rubric criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "**Adaptive Evaluation**: Rubrics are tailored to each specific question-answer pair, ensuring relevant and context-appropriate assessment criteria"

    "## Understanding Amazon Nova LLM-as-a-Judge Evaluation Metrics \n",
    "\n",
    "When using the Amazon Nova LLM-as-a-Judge framework to compare the outputs of two language models, a set of quantitative metrics is generated. These metrics help you objectively assess which model performs better and how reliable the evaluation is.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Preference Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "- **a_scores**  \n",
    "  The number of times Model A's response was preferred by the judge model over Model B.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **b_scores**  \n",
    "  The number of times Model B's response was preferred by the judge model over Model A.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ties**  \n",
    "  The number of times the judge found both responses equally good or could not determine a preference.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **inference_error**  \n",
    "  The number of evaluation cases where the judge could not provide a valid judgment due to technical issues, malformed outputs, or other errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rubric-Specific Metrics\n",
    "- **weighted_a / weighted_b** Aggregate weighted scores for each model calculated by combining criterion-specific scores multiplied by their respective weights. These provide a more nuanced performance measure than simple win counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **margin** The difference between weighted scores (typically weighted_b - weighted_a), indicating the magnitude of preference. Negative margins favor Model B, positive margins favor Model A.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **criteria_breakdown** Detailed performance across individual rubric dimensions (e.g., accuracy: 0.7 weight, completeness: 0.2 weight, clarity: 0.1 weight) with justifications for each criterion.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "### Statistical Confidence Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "- **winrate**  \n",
    "  The proportion of valid judgments in which Model B was preferred\n",
    "\n",
    "- **lower_rate**  \n",
    "  The lower bound of the 95% confidence interval for the winrate. This tells you the minimum likely winrate for Model B, accounting for statistical uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **upper_rate**  \n",
    "  The upper bound of the 95% confidence interval for the winrate. This tells you the maximum likely winrate for Model B.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **average_weighted_score_a / average_weighted_score_b** Mean weighted scores across all valid evaluations, providing aggregate performance measures that account for rubric criterion weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **average_margin** Mean margin across all evaluations, indicating the typical magnitude of preference between models.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Standard Error Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "- **a_scores_stderr, b_scores_stderr, ties_stderr, inference_error_stderr, score_stderr**  \n",
    "  These metrics reflect the standard error (uncertainty) of each corresponding count or score. Smaller values indicate more reliable results, while larger values suggest more variability or a need for a larger sample size.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to Interpret These Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Winrate and Confidence Intervals**\n",
    "If the winrate is significantly above 0.5 and the confidence interval does not include 0.5, Model B is statistically favored across rubric criteria.\n",
    "If the winrate is below 0.5 and the confidence interval does not include 0.5, Model A is statistically favored.\n",
    "If the interval includes 0.5, results are inconclusive and may require additional evaluations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Weighted Score Analysis**\n",
    "  - Compare average_weighted_score_a vs average_weighted_score_b to understand overall performance accounting for criterion importance.\n",
    "Examine average_margin to assess the typical magnitude of performance differences.\n",
    "Review criteria_breakdown to identify specific strengths and weaknesses (e.g., Model B excels in accuracy but Model A is better at clarity).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Error Analysis**\n",
    "  - High inference_error or large standard errors indicate possible issues with the evaluation process, rubric generation, or insufficient data.\n",
    "Review individual evaluation justifications to understand why errors occurred.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Preference Distribution**\n",
    "  - The balance of a_scores, b_scores, and ties provides a direct picture of model performance differences on your evaluation set.\n",
    "Weighted scores provide deeper insight than raw counts by accounting for criterion importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "**Scalable Evaluation**: Automated rubric-based comparison of multiple models with dynamically generated evaluation criteria\n",

    "**Statistical Rigor**: Confidence intervals and significance testing with weighted scoring across multiple rubric dimensions (accuracy, completeness, clarity)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cost Efficiency**: Reduced need for human evaluation through automated rubric generation and criterion-specific scoring\n",

    "**Actionable Insights**: Clear metrics for model selection with detailed justifications per evaluation criterion and weighted performance analysis\n",

    "The 70% win rate with a confidence interval not crossing the 50% threshold suggests statistically meaningful superiority for the 7B model, though the relatively small sample size (11 evaluations) means continued testing would strengthen these conclusions."
