    "[Reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT)]() involves applying reinforcement learning techniques to existing models to enhance their reasoning capabilities. By exploring various solutions and rewarding effective strategies, RFT enables the model to make more precise decisions and better understand context. This approach results in improved performance and more accurate interpretations. \n",

    "## **1. Introduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT)\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) is a machine learning technique that improves model performance through feedback signals—measurable scores or rewards indicating response quality—rather than direct supervision with exact correct answers. Unlike traditional supervised fine-tuning that learns from input-output pairs, RFT uses reward functions to evaluate model responses and iteratively optimizes the model to maximize these rewards. This approach is particularly effective for tasks where defining the exact correct output is challenging, but you can reliably measure response quality. RFT enables models to learn complex behaviors and preferences through trial and feedback, making it ideal for applications requiring nuanced decision-making, creative problem-solving, or adherence to specific quality criteria that can be programmatically evaluated.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "###  How Does It Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Reinforcement fine-tuning uses GRPO (Group Relative Policy Optimization), in which you start from an instruction-tuned baseline and treat each prompt like a small tournament: for a given input, you sample a handful of candidate answers from the model, score each one with the reward function, then rank them within that group. The update step simply nudges the model to make higher-scoring candidates more likely next time and lower-scoring ones less likely, while a stay-close-to-baseline constraint keeps behavior from drifting or becoming verbose or exploitative. You repeat this loop over many prompts, refreshing hard cases, tightening verifiers or judge rubrics when you see exploits, and continuously tracking task metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  When to Use RFT?\n",
    "\n",
    "Tasks that benefit most from RFT share a few traits. They have measurable success signals even when a single correct output is hard to specify; they admit partial credit or graded quality (so better vs. worse answers can be ranked within a prompt or using a reward function); they involve multiple objectives that must be balanced (e.g., accuracy with brevity, clarity, safety, or cost); they require adherence to explicit constraints that can be programmatically checked; they operate in tool-mediated or environment-based settings where outcomes are observable (success/failure, latency, resource use); and they occur in low-label regimes where collecting gold targets is expensive but automated or rubric-based feedback is plentiful. In short, RFT shines wherever you can turn quality into a reliable scalar or ranking and want the model to preferentially amplify higher-scoring behaviors without needing exhaustive labeled targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider other methods when:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You have plentiful, reliable labeled input-output pairs → use SFT\n",
    "* The main gap is knowledge/jargon → use retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)\n",
    "* Your reward signal is noisy/unreliable and can't be fixed with better rubrics/checkers → stabilize that first before RFT\n",
    "\n",
    "###  When NOT to Use RFT?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Avoid RFT when you can cheaply produce reliable labeled input-output pairs (SFT will be simpler, cheaper, and more stable); \n",
    "* when the gap is knowledge/jargon rather than behavior (prefer RAG); \n",
    "* when your reward signal is noisy, sparse, easy to game, or expensive/slow to compute (fix the evaluator first); \n",
    "* when baseline performance is near-zero (bootstrap with SFT before optimizing preferences); \n",
    "* when the task has deterministic schemas, strict formatting, or a single correct answer (SFT or rule-based validation works better); \n",
    "* when tight latency/cost budgets can't absorb the extra sampling/exploration RFT requires; \n",
    "* or when safety/policy constraints aren't crisply specified and enforceable in the reward.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In short: if you can point to \"the right answer,\" do SFT; if you need new knowledge, use RAG; use RFT only after you have a solid baseline and a robust, fast, hard-to-exploit reward function.\n"
