You will be given a search query and the resulting product information and will classify the result against a provided classification scheme which is provided as a label, description couple. Follow the given instructions to classify the search query using the classification scheme\n\nESCI Categories:\n\nCategory Label: Exact\nCategory Exact Description: This group includes products that precisely match the search query in terms of brand, model, specifications, and intended use. These results directly fulfill the user's expressed intent and are the most relevant matches. For example, if the search query is \"Apple iPhone 13 Pro 256GB,\" an exact match would be that specific model with the exact storage capacity.\n\nCategory Label: Substitute\nCategory Substitute Description: This category encompasses products that serve the same primary function or purpose as the queried item but may differ in brand, model, or specific features. These are alternative options that could satisfy the user's underlying need. For instance, if the query is for a specific laptop model, other laptops with similar specifications from different brands would be classified as substitutes. In cases of overlap with complement, the classification should be based on the primary intent of the search query and the dominant characteristic of the product in relation to that query.\n\nCategory Label: Complement\nCategory Complement Description: Complementary products are those that enhance, support, or are commonly used in conjunction with the queried item. While not direct matches, these products are relevant as they add value to or are often purchased alongside the primary product. For example, if the search is for a digital camera, complementary items might include camera bags, memory cards, or additional lenses. In cases of overlap with substitute, the classification should be based on the primary intent of the search query and the dominant characteristic of the product in relation to that query.\n\nCategory Label: Irrelevant\nCategory Irrelevant Description: This group contains products that have little to no relation to the search query and do not meet the user's probable intent. These results may appear due to coincidental keyword matches or system errors but are not useful to the user in the context of their search. An example would be returning results for apple-scented candles when the user searches for Apple electronics.\n\nSearch Query:\nfoco\n\n\nProduct Information: \nresult product title: ['foco NFL - Mochila de acci\u00f3n con logotipo del equipo']\nresult product bullet points: ['100% con licencia oficial', 'Disponible en todos los equipos y ligas', 'Muestra a tu fan Hood']\nresult product type: ['BACKPACK']\nresult product category: ['gl_sports']\nresult product brand: ['FOCO']\nresult product color: ['Team Color']\nresult product size: ['talla \u00fanica']\n\n\nInstructions:\n- First, provide a scratchpad section for your initial thoughts, observations, and relevant information about the search query and product. This section is for your internal use and doesn't need to be structured.\n- Second, identify and analyze the search query (translating to English if necessary). Identify key terms, brand names, model numbers, and specifications. Determine the user's likely intent based on the query. Consider any cultural or regional context if relevant.\n- Third, identify and review the product information (translating to English if necessary). Examine the product name, bullet points, type, and any other provided details. Consider multiple aspects such as functionality, target audience, and price range.\n- Fourth, compare the query to the product. Look for exact matches in brand, model, and specifications. Identify similarities in function, purpose, or features. Consider how the product relates to or enhances the queried item.\n- Then, apply the ESCI Classification, think step by step:\n  a) Exact: Check if all key elements of the query match the product precisely. Ensure that brand, model, specifications, and intended use align perfectly.\n  b) Substitute: If not an exact match, determine if the product serves the same primary function. Compare specifications and features to see if they're similar enough to be a viable alternative.\n  c) Complement: If not exact or substitute, consider if the product enhances or is commonly used with the queried item. Evaluate whether it's a logical accessory or add-on for the primary product.\n  d) Irrelevant: If the product doesn't fit any of the above categories, classify it as irrelevant. Check for coincidental keyword matches that might have caused the product to appear in results.\n- Validate the classification by reviewing the chosen category against its description to ensure accuracy. Consider edge cases or potential ambiguities.\n- Finally, provide justification in the scratchpad, explaining the reasoning behind the classification choice and highlighting key factors that led to the decision. Provide your final ESCI label for the product result: exact/substitute/complement/irrelevant.\n\nYour output MUST ALWAYS be in json format as follows and you WILL NOT wrap it in json markers:\n\n{\n    \"scratchpad\": string, // your reasoning for the classification\n\t\"escilabel\": string,  // the Label name\n}"
